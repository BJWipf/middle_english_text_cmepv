P.S.\u2014 Probably the recollection of what Pegge says in the Preface to the Forme of Cury , \"There is mention of blanch-powder or white sugar ,\" 132 . They, however, were not the same, for see No. 193, p. xxvi-xxvii. On turning to the Recipe 132, of \"Peeris in confyt,\" p. 62-3, we find \"whan \u00feei [the pears] buth ysode, take hem up, make a syrup of wyne greke. o\u00feer vernage with blaunche powdur, o\u00feer white sugur, and powdour gyngur, & do the peris \u00feerin.\" It is needless to say that if a modern recipe said take \"sugar or honey,\" sugar could not be said \"to be sometimes called\" honey.

They are all more or less mucilaginous and emollient. If Yarde = Virga ; then it is Marshmallow, or Malva Sylvestris; if yarde = erde, earth; then the rotundifolia.\u2014 'The common Mallowe, or the tawle wilde Mallow, and the common Hockes' of Lyte's Dodoens, 1578, p. 581, Malua sylvestris , as distinguished from the Malua sativa , or \" Rosa vltramarina , that is to say, the Beyondesea Rose, in Frenche, Maulue de iardin or cultiu\u00e9e . . in English, Holyhockes, and great tame Mallow, or great Mallowes of the Garden.\" The \"Dwarffe Mallowe . . is called Malua syluestris pumila .\" / peritory PARITORY is Pellitory of the wall, parietaria . Wall pellitory abounds in nitrate of potass. There are two other pellitories: 'P. of Spain'\u2014this is Pyrethrum , which the Spanish corrupted into pelitre , and we corrupted pelitre into pellitory. The other, bastard-pellitory, is Achillea Ptarmica. \u2014 Peritory, parietaria, vrseolaris, vel astericum . Withals. / and \u00fee brown fenelle, BROWN FENNELLE = probably Peucedanum officinale , or Hoss fennel, a dangerous plant; certainly not Anethum Graveolens , which is always dill, dyle, dile, &c.\u2014 ? The sweet Fennel, Anethum Graveolens , formerly much used in medicine (Thomson). The gigantic fennel is ( Ferula ) Assaf\u0153tida . walle wort Sambucus ebulus , Danewort.

Veronica Beccabunga , formerly considered as an anti-scorbutic applied externally. It is very inert. If a person fed on it, it might do some good, i.e. about a quarter of the good that the same quantity of water-cress would do. \u2014BILGRES, probably = henbane, hyoscysmus niger . Compare Dutch [Du. Bilsen , Hexham, and German Bilse ]. Bil = byle = boil, modern. It was formerly applied externally, with marsh-mallow and other mucilaginous and emollient plants, to ulcers, boils, &c.

Prof. Brewer has, I find, printed these Statuta in his most interesting and valuable Monumenta Franciscana , 1858, p. 582-6. He differs from Mr Brock and me in reading drunkelewe (drunken, in Chaucer, &c.) as 'drunke, lewe,' and vessels as 'bossels,' and in adding e 's In this he is probably right. The general custom of editors justifies it. Our printers want a pig-tailed or curly g to correspond with the MS. one. to some final g 's. He says, by way of Intro|duction, that, \"Though entitled Ordinances for the Household of Bishop Grostete, this is evidently a Letter addressed to the Bishop on the management of his Household by some very intimate friend. From the terms used in the Letter, it is clear that the writer must have been on confidential terms with the Prelate. I cannot affirm positively that the writer was Adam de Marisco, although to no other would this document be attributed with greater probability. No one else enjoyed such a degree of Grostete's affection; none would have ventured to address him with so much familiarity. Besides, the references made more than once by Adam de Marisco in his letters to the management of the Bishop's household, greatly strengthen this supposition. See pp. 160, 170 ( Mon. Francisc. ).

It makes the rod the great persuader to learning and gentleness.] All maner chyldryn, ye lysten & lere A lesson of wysedome \u00feat ys wryte here! My chyld, y rede \u00fee be wys, and take hede of \u00feis ryme! Old men yn prouerbe sayde by old tyme 'A chyld were beter to be vnbore Than to be vntaught, and so be lore.'
