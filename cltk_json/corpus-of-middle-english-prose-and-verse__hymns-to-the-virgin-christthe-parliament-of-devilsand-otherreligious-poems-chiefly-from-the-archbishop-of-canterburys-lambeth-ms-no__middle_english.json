B . 11. 24, Trinity College, Cambridge; ab . 1450, A.D.] Kynge of grace, & ful of pyte, Lord of heuyn, I-blyssyd \u00feou be! Haue mercy on vs, we the beseche, Or we lese our wytt & speche! xv. tokenys telle I may That shal come before doomys day, As it is seyde yn the prophecye, In the book of Jeremye. Herkenyth now \u00fee tokenynge That \u00fee firste day shal brynge: Fro heuyn shal a rayne falle, Hit shal be byttyr as eny galle, Hytt shall be as red as any blod, Ouyr all \u00fee worlle a grymly flod; Hytt schalle ouergo wyth large mett Alle that ys in erth I-sett: The chylderyn vn-born Aferd shall be Of thys tokenynge, as I telle the, And meue hem tyll our Syth Ryth as \u00feey speke myth. The secunde day ys stronge with alle: The sterrys shal fro heuyn falle, So dredfulle and so breyth As the fyre off \u00fee dondyr lyth. Men schalle say, \"welle-away! Thys ben the tokenys off domys day!\" They schall cry & syke sore, And say, \"lord, mercy, thyn ore [MS. thynore] !\" The iij de day ys off syche: In erthe and in heuyn-ryche The hye son thatt ys so bryth, So fayr, and so full off lyth, Hitt shalle be swarte as any pyche: Alle thatt shall be rewlyche. Men schalle \u00feen sone se Att mydday hytt shalle swarte be; All thatt ben on lyve Schalle thys wordys dryve, \"Alas thatt we scholle Abyde To se \u00feis sorowe in Euery syde!\" The iiij te day ys swythe longe, With wepynge & wyth sorow Amonge: All \u00feat in erthe stonde Schall to red blod wende; They schalle drawe hem to \u00fee grownde, Ther schalle they dwelle butt no stownde, To the see \u00feey schalle for drede, Ryth as moyses the prophytt sayde, Thatt the mone schalle rewly falle And wynd outt of hys reche stalle. The man schalle say to hys wyff \"Alas \u00featt we be nowe Alyve!\" The v te day comyth swythe; For euery best \u00featt ys on lyve, Toward heuyn her hedd schall holde. For thatt won\u00feer As y yowe tollde, Men schalle say, \"lord, thyn ore Off our sorowe & off our sore!\" Thys tellyth the prophecy In \u00fee booke of Jeromy. Welle we schalle vndyrstonde Thatt cristyndom hatt vn\u00feerfonge. \"Thatt day, Ihesus to vs se As \u00feou [Omitted, and inserted in Margin.] vs bowtyst vppon a tre, Thatt we may com to \u00fey blysse Lord, when \u00fey wille ys!\" The vj day schall down Falle The treys with \u00fee croppys alle, And toward \u00fee erthe the croppys schalle be. For fere the man schalle lese hys wyff, The wyff her chyld, \u00fee chylld his lyff; Alle thatt leve schall lese here wytte; Wo they be thatt schalle a-byde hytte, Bettyr they were to be oute off lyve Than soche payne for to dryve. The vij day schalle fall down Chyrche and castelle and euery town [MS. down ] ; All schall to-breke; and euery hylle Shalle lowe, valeys For to Fylle; The erthe schalle [be] shene and clene; In \u00feis worlle alle schalle be evyn; Than schalle \u00fee worlle evyn be: Wo ys he \u00feat thatt schalle se! The viij day ys a day off drede, Ryth as moyses \u00fee prophytt seyde Thatt the see woll ryse & fle, Thatt euery best aferd schall be; Than for drede hytt woll ryse & flowe With wawys grete, & stormys towe: Thorowe the strength off \u00fee wynd Into the Welken hitt schall slynge; All thatt leuyth \u00featt day Wold fle away, but \u00feey ne may; Vndyr erthe I-hydd they wold be Thatt Ihesu cryst scholl nott hem Ase. Then wolle the see wytdrawe, And wend to hys owyn hawe. Godd of heuyn, \u00feat best may, Haue mercy on vs vppon \u00featt day! The ix day, wondyr hytt ys, As the prophecy tellyth hytt I-wys: Thatt all \u00feynge schall speke \u00fean, And cry in erthe aftyr \u00fee steuyn off man, And be-mone hem self in owr sy&yogh;th Ryth as \u00feey speke myth. Lord Ihesu, thy myth \u00feou fullfelle! We be sorry \u00featt we dede agayn \u00fei wille Or with towyth or with dede. Lord Ihesu! brenge vs oute of \u00feis drede Thatt we may com to rest! Ther bale ys most, & bote ys nexte. The .x. day ys day of welaway As gregory sayth, and Jeromy: Than schalle knele \u00fee angelys bryth Before \u00fee face of godd allmyth. Seynt peter, no\u00feer his felow-redde, Dar nott speke A word for drede; They schalle se heuyn vngo, [O.H.G. intg\u00e2n , to perish.\u2014Bradley.] And \u00fee erthe schall Also, They schalle schryke & crye lome For \u00fee drede of \u00fee grett dome. Develyn schall com oute off helle As seynt Johan doyth vs tell, They schalle kry, \"lord, thyn ore Off our sorowe & of our sore! Lett vs to heuyn com! Longe \u00feou hast hytt vs be-nome For our gylt, and our mysdede, And for our awyn wykkyd rede!\" Thys ys a day of moche sorowe; A strongyr comyth on the morrowe, The xi day comyth lyche, With stronge stormys sykyrlyche, And alle the stonys moche & lyte Scholle to-gedyr sore smyte; Alle the worlle schalle to-dryve; Wo be \u00feey \u00featt ben on lyve! The rayn bowe Iwryyd schalle be, Grymlyche In sy&yogh;th for to see. Than the deuelyn schalle swyde ren, And for fere to helle torn; God wille say, \"ther schull ye be, Ther schall ye wone & be war [? war be] :\" God grownte so to be-tyde Thatt we may be on bettyr syde! The xij day ys dredfulle than; For than was neuer schappe of man That wolle \u00featt god dyd hym ryth, Yff he dyrst, & most of myth. Angelys thatt hym seruyn alle, Scholl for vs vppon kneys falle, To goddys feett for our syn; And for the loue of all man kyn. Lord we be-seche the In \u00fei mercy for to be! Dredfully comyth the xiij day To all \u00featt Abyde hytt may. Fro the begynnynge of Adamys com Tylle the end of \u00fee day of doome, Ne myth no man in booke rede Half the sorow, no\u00feer half \u00fee drede, That god schalle say than When he comyth down yn schappe of man; For alle the stonys grett and smale Thatt byth in erthe withoutyn tale, All they schalle to-gedyr drynge, And euerychon to o\u00feer dynge; They schall ryse & grynd so Thatt \u00fee fyr fro hem schalle go; They schall bren also bryth As \u00fee fyr of \u00fee dondyr lyth. The xiiij day ys A day of sorowe; Stronge fyr schalle com on \u00fee morow, Ther schalle nothyng in \u00feys worlle leve Butt schalle bren to morow tyll eve. Thys passyth nott swythe sone; On the morow ys \u00fee day of doome. The xv day comyth swythe: For euery man \u00feat was on lyve Fro Adamys tyme, the fyrst man, Alle to the dome schalle com than, Euery man of xxx ti wynter olde, All schall com \u00fee dome to be-holde; Euery man schalle o\u00feere mete Att the mownte of olevett. Two angelys schall blowe her bemys; The folke schall com alle attonys. Fulle sore than they may Agryse Whan they shulle to \u00fee dome aryse; Two angelys schall com be-forne With \u00fee scorges, and with the crowne of thorn, With drewry cher and sory mode, As hytt on hys hedd stode; And the sper al so scharpe As hytt stod on hys hertt. For no enuy, ne for no pryde, Longeus hym stonge dorow \u00fee syde: Longeus then styll stode, On hys fyngorys ran \u00fee blod, He strokyd ther-with hys eyn ryth, They be-coom as cler as candyll&yogh;th. \"Kynge and lord full of pyte, Thys mys-gylt \u00feou for-yeue me! I dyd hyt for non evyll dede, No\u00feer for no covetyse of mede.\" Angelys schall brenge \u00fee rode bryth, With blody naylys precyous of syth. Then comyth our lord with drewry mode, Wyth armys I-spred all on blod: \"Man, now \u00fee soth \u00feou mayst I-se, Whatt I sufferd her for the. Thys passyon I sufferd her for \u00fee: I-cronyd I was with thornys of a tre; Thys was to the leff for to swere Be my eyn & be myn here, And be my paynys that wher stronge. Man, hytt was \u00fee fulle ryve To swere be my wowndys fyve, Be my tethe And my tonge, Be my hertt and be my longe, Hytt thowyth the fulle grett pryde For to swere be my syde, Be my brayne & be my hedd; [? heved ] be my sowle I was ofte be-revyd. Man, hytt was full grett dyspyte So offte to make me edwyte! Thou woldyst nott clothe me, ne fede, Thou woldyst nott helpe me att my nede! Man offte \u00feou hast for-sworn me! Man what sufferst \u00feou for me?\" Than comyth our lady hem be-fore\u2014 In blyssyd tyme was she I-bore\u2014 With terys rennynge alle on blodd, Sore wepynge with drewry modd; \"Fadyr, & son, and holygost, Kynge and lord as \u00feou wost, My swete son, I praye de [ thee ] My bone to day \u00feou grawnt me! Thy honde warke \u00feat \u00feou hast wrowyth, My dere son, for-lese hem nowhte!

My chyldryn \u00feat haue seruyd me, In my blysse they schall euere be; Ye scholl com with me to heuyn With angelys songe and mery steuyn. And he clepyth hym be-fore,\u2014 In blyssyd tyme wer they I-bore,\u2014 He spekyth to hem myldelyche, 'Comyth with me to my kyngdome ryche.' \" Lord we be-seche \u00fee Thy swete blysse \u00featt we mott se; When we com to oure lyvys ende, Into thy blysse \u00feat we mot wende, And grawnt vs thatt hytt so be!
