SEn the pa&sslong;age of this vrechit warlde, the quhilk is callit dede, &slong;emys harde, perelus, ande rycht horreble to mony men, alanerly For the wnknawlage at thai have thare-of, tharfore this lytill trety, the quhilk is callyt the craft of deyng, is to be notyde & &slong;charply con&slong;ederyt to thaim that are put in the fech[t]inge of dede; For to \u00feaim, ande to al vthere folk, It may awaill rycht mekle till have a gude ende, the quhilk makis a werk perfyte, as the ewill end wndois al gud werk before wrocht.  The fyr&stlong; chepture of this trety begynnys of the commendatioune of dede, Fore ded, as haly wryt &slong;ais is mar pretiouxe and worthy, is mai&stlong; terreble, of al thing that may be Thocht. Ande in-&slong;amekle as the &slong;aull Is mare pretious & worthy than The body, in-&slong;amekle is the ded of It mare perulus and doutable to be tholyt.  Ande the ded of synfull man, but &slong;ufficiant Repentans, is euer ill, as the dede of gude men, how &slong;oding or terreble at euer It be, is gude & pretious before gode: For the dede of gude men is nocht ell bot the pa&slong;ing of per&slong;onis Retwrnynge fra bana&slong;ynge, offputyng of a full hevy byrdinge, end of all &slong;eknes, e&slong;chevyng of perellys, the terme of all Ill, the brekinge of al bandys, the payment of naturell det, the agane-cumynge to the kynde lande, ande the entering to perpetuall Joy and welfare; And tharfor the day of ded o neide men is better than the day of thar byrthe; And &slong;a thai that ar all weill &slong;chrewyne, and deis in the faithe and &slong;acrementis of haly kyrk, how wyolently at euer thai dee, thai suld nocht dreid thare ded; Fore he that valde weill de, &slong;uld glaidly dee, and conferme his wyll to the wyll of gode; for &slong;en vs behwys all de o neid, and we wat no\u00feer the tyme nor the &stlong;ed, we &slong;uld re&slong;aue It glaidly, that god and nature has ordanyt, & gruche nocht thar-wyth, &slong;en It may nocht be e&slong;chewyt, For god, at ordanyt ded, ordanyt It fore the be&stlong;, ande he is mare be&slong;y fore our gud than we our &slong;elf can ore may be, &slong;en we ar his creaturys and handewerkis; and tharfore al men that wald weill de, &slong;uld leir to de, the quhilk is nocht ellys bot to have hart and thocht euer to god, and ay be reddy to re&slong;aue the ded, but ony murmwr, as he that baide the cumyne of his frend; & this is the craft that al kynd of man &slong;uld be be&slong;ye to &stlong;udy in, that is to &slong;ay, to have his lyf, how velthye or pure that It be, takyne In paciens that gode sendis.  Thai that are in the artykle of ded has v\u00feer temptations be the deuill, and mar merualus, than euer \u00feai had in thare lyfe; Fyr&stlong;, the deuil tempis a man in his deing in the faith of haly kyrk, For but faythe may na man be &slong;aufe.  And It is the grund of al gud deid, \u00feer-for \u00fee deuill a&sslong;ais, gif he can gare ony man vare in the treuth, as to put to hyme, that he wald neuer dee For synaris, na be borne of the vergyne mary, & &slong;afurth, of the new testament.  And \u00feerfore ilk temporall man &slong;uld trow as haly wryt &slong;ais, and namly that his curat tech-is hyme, ande have his hart fermly Set \u00feerone.  Ande he that is in the artykle houre of dede &slong;uld have a man to raher\u00df to hyme the poyntis of \u00fee trouthe, in &slong;yk langage \u00feat he mycht wnder&stlong;ande, Rycht oft, fore It gret comfort to hyme, and the deuil may nocht heire It : al&slong;ua \u00feai &slong;uld raher\u00df to hyme the gret faith and paciens of marterys ande vthire haly men, how wychtly \u00feai &slong;u&stlong;enyt al tormentis and pa&sslong;ionys done to thaim, for the faith of haly kyrke, and ourcome thar ennemys by paciens and ferme faith, as men may Reid in thar &stlong;oreis.  For he that is ferme in the faith optenis tharthrow al that is profytable to the &slong;aull and lyf baith, and It is to wyt quhat temtacioune at euer the deuill putis to man, &slong;al nocht noy hyme, bot gyf he wyl fully con&slong;ent thar-to and at he be in his rycht mynd.  For in the houre of ded the deuill wyll ca&stlong; mony wreukis of fal&slong;ait the quhilk Suld nocht be trowyt, for he is our auld enemye and fa\u00feer of lei&slong;ingis.  The threuth is fundyt apone this, that god with-&slong;aif to tak mankynd to Radem the tre&slong;pas that adam and Eue commytyt in paradice, quhar-throw al mankynde was &slong;mitit, & nan was worthy of his of&slong;pryng to pay that ran&slong;one for the oreginall &slong;yne at thai ware fylyt with, for god herys na &slong;ynaris; and tharfor god, throw his mekyll mer&slong;y, send his anerly &slong;one to be incarnat, &slong;en nan was worthy \u00feer-to, bot he; for he was na &slong;ynar, and hervpone is fowndit al the faithe, the quhilk was confermit be &slong;ancte Johne the bapty&stlong;, and mony o\u00feer prophetis, or cry&stlong; was borne mony a hundred  &yogh;hir.  The to\u00feer temptacioune that the deuill tempis a man with, Is di&slong;par of godis mekille mer&slong;ye; for quhen the deuill fyndis a man wexit and torment with &slong;eknes, he bryngis to his mynd \u00fee ded that he Is lyk to cum to, and the &slong;ynis that he has done, wnconfe&sslong;yt of or Rapentyt, and na penans, na condigne &slong;ati&slong;faccione maid for \u00feaim, and puttish yme In dy&slong;pare of mercy, and thus he ekys &slong;orow upone &slong;orow to confound hyme.  And as haly &slong;cripture &slong;ais, ilke man &slong;al se, in the hour of ded, cry&stlong; as he was crucefyd one the cors, in con&slong;olacioune to gud men, and in confu&slong;ioune and &slong;chame to Ill men, at thai ar nocht worthy to have thaim to thare bru\u00feer rademar & helpare: and this is a perelus temptacioune.  Neuer-the-le\u00df, \u00feocht a man had done als mony &slong;ynnis as thare is dropis in the &slong;ey, or al the &slong;ynnis in the werlde hyme alane, and he had neuer ben &slong;chrewyne befor, till the houre of ded, &slong;a at thare-of he mycht haf &slong;uffi&sslong;and contri&slong;cione, he war &slong;auf; fore godis mercy is abwne al his werkis, and he may nocht deny mercy treuly askyt: bot It is the &slong;ykire&stlong; to manis &slong;aluacioune to be &slong;chrewyne, and do worthy penans, tyll he Is in pro&slong;peryte; and \u00feocht a man mycht nocht have &slong;pace to a&slong;k mercy, tharfor &slong;uld he nocht dy&slong;pare, fore that ware mar ekyne of &slong;orow to hyme.  And this is ane generall prouerb, that &slong;yne noyis nocht that is &slong;ufficiandly for-thocht, and the pocy of the cro\u00df &slong;chawis the mercy of Cri&stlong;, for he hange \u00feer-one, Inclynand the hed to the heryng, the mouth to \u00fee ky&slong;ing, the armys to the embrai&slong;ing, the handis to the gevyn, and al his body to the Rademyng of Synaris, and &slong;ua &slong;uld na man be dy&slong;paryt of godys mercy: For in en&slong;ampill thare-of he gaif to the mai&stlong; &slong;ynare mai&stlong; mercy and grace, as to Petyr at denyd hyme, to Paul at per&slong;ewyt hyme, to matho the okyrar, to magdalyne the &slong;ynare, till dauid the murther&slong;ar and adultrare, to \u00fee theif that hang be&slong;yd hyme one the cros, and to mony vthir that war lange to raher\u00df. The [\u00ferid] temptacioune is in-paciens or vntholmudnes, the quhilk is nocht to luf god abwne al thinge, & to thank hyme of al his &slong;ayndes and gyftes, at ar al fore the be&stlong;, and thai war weill knawing, thai that trawalys in the artykle of ded, bot gyf \u00feai be cumyne to the natural cours of eilde, the quilk few cumys to; For ma deis of exces and my&slong;gouernans in youthed, than is &sllong;ane into batell; thir men, for the &stlong;renthe at thai have of complexioune, or laith to de, and &slong;a thai thole in thar &slong;eknes meruolus dolur and infirmyte, the quhilk thai tak nocht in paciens, for the luf of god, as he dyd for \u00feaim quhen he &slong;ufferyt ded: for he opnyt na mare his mouth na the lam dois quhen his throt is wnder the knyf; and &slong;ua mony of thir men gangis rammy\u00df, vthir &slong;um mermwrys, and thinkis that payne vrangwys, and gruchis, and &slong;wa thai obey nocht with gud hart to the ordynans and rychtwy\u00df Iugment of god; and tharfor It is nedfull to al men, in the tyme of that dy&slong;e\u00df, to think and to knaw that his &slong;ynis aw to have mar pwny&slong;cioune than he may tholl; for al the payne that euer we tholl, Is rychtwy&slong;nes : and \u00fee gud at we gete is of grace, and thar-for a verray penytent man thinkis al his &slong;eknes lytill, in compare&slong;one one-to the luf at god &slong;chawyt till ws, and to the Redemptioune of our tre&slong;pas.  Ande Sen the &slong;eknes, at we have her, is gevyne ws in part of our purgatory, it &slong;uld be blychtly re&slong;auit, and als al the tribulation and &slong;orow at we may tholl here, Is nocht worthy to be maid compare&slong;one to the Ioy of hevyne, that in the paciens thar-of we may wyne.  For &slong;wetnes is \u00fee better knawing, at &slong;wetnes has ben befor tai&stlong;yt.  And &slong;ua the &slong;ek &slong;uld &slong;ay in the payne at he tholys; now byrne, now &slong;chere, now thri&stlong;, now &sllong;a, that before god [he] may alleg the patyens \u00feer-of fore the luf of hyme and have eternall Ioy \u00feer fore.   For god &slong;endys to \u00feaim that he louis warldly payne , \u00feat &slong;une. \u00fean &slong;um pa&sslong;is, for hevynly Ioy at euer le&stlong;is.  And thus a man &slong;uld with al his hart conforme hyme to haf paciens, thankand god, without murmur, of that payne, and &slong;a to wyne hyme &slong;elf.  For euer the temptatione at man tholys in the hour of ded Is pryd; for quhen the deuill &slong;eis that he may nocht dy&slong;e&sslong; a man in \u00fee faith of the kirk, na [be] di&slong;peracione of godis mercy, na be inpaciens of his &slong;eknes, \u00fee find. than tempis he hyme, &slong;ayand thus, \"\u00feu art nocht as vthir men are, \u00feow art &stlong;renthy in thi face, & in the hop of the mercy of god \u00feow art wycht and tholmud in to &slong;eknes, and \u00feow has done mony gud deid, and \u00feerfore \u00feow nedys na mercy, bot al the thank \u00fear-of.\"  This  pre&slong;umptioune is Rycht perelus, and a fell temptacioune, and for-thy a man &slong;uld think, that all his euill dedis cumys of hyme &slong;elf and all his gud dedys cumys of grace, and the gyft of god; & &slong;ykirly, ay \u00fee bettyr man, ay \u00fee mar lawly; and quhen the ymagynacioune of a manis gud dedis cumis by the temptatioune of the deuill, he &slong;uld brynge to his mynd his Ill dedis, at thai ma law hyme, and bryng hyme to knaw his fragelyte, and to a&sklong; mercy, and nocht to pryd hyme In his gud dedis.  For to have pryd of his gud dedis is a temptacioune callyt pre&slong;umcioune; and dreid of the mercy of god [Is] This word is in the MS. for Ill dedis Is ane vthir temptacioune callyt dy&slong;par; and he that can weill e&slong;chef thir twa, in the hour of ded, ourcumys the deuill.  For euer the fyft temptacioune that the deuill tempys a man, Is in hes warldly gudis: he thinkis dy&slong;e\u00df to leif his gret Riches mowable or wnmouable, his wyf and barnis, and &slong;ik o\u00feer ple&slong;ans; and &slong;yker It is quha takes hyme &slong;orow or dy&slong;es, in the levyng of thir cardenall delytes, that he is nocht &slong;ykyre in the faith.  For and he de, as he &slong;uld de, he &slong;uld think that he &slong;uld pas to mare Ioy na fore to leif &slong;ic tran&slong;ytorie warldis gudis, the quhilk are lent hyme bot For a tyme ple&slong;and to god to tholl, or as ane In&stlong;rument to vyne hyme&slong;elf to hevyne, as ane hamyr is ane in&stlong;rument to mak a knyf wyth.  Bot the deuill tempis men &slong;ua in thar varldly gudis, that wylfully \u00feai ga to the deuill fore thaim, and quhen thai wat at thai mone dee, thai wyll nocht glaidly part with \u00feaim, na thol the ordynans of god \u00feerof, at thar powar, na &yogh;hit \u00feer dettis to be payt, bot erar de&slong;yre at thar barnis and thar wyvys be po&sslong;e&sslong;yt of \u00feaim, quhe\u00feer \u00feai be cumyne fal&slong;ly or Rychtwy&slong;ly, thinkand thar ryches nocht able to be dy&slong;ponyt fore \u00fear &slong;aulys, or to mak Sati&slong;faccioune with thaim gyf \u00feai Ware vrangwy&slong;ly vonyng, trowand at god has na cur of thi[r] barnis, to grant thaim riches, bot gif at thai dy&slong;pone al vpone thaim: and &slong;ic folkes &slong;uld erar be callyt be&stlong;es vnracionable, than man ra&slong;onable; for be&stlong;is knawis na thing bot erde and warldly thingis, by the re&slong;one of the erde at thai ar maid off.  Men &slong;uld knaw \u00fee hewyne, by Re&slong;one of the &slong;aull that come, and was maid thar-by go amang the angell.  And thus he, that vald weill ourcum this temptacione, &slong;uld thank god of his grace, at lent hyme thir warldly gudis to help hyme with, anerly to his end; thankand hyme thar-of, and gyfand thaim to hyme gladly agane, till his fre di&slong;po&slong;e&slong;ione: for no\u00feer wyf, nore barnis, na o\u00feer riches, ar lang gevyne. And thus, nocht agane&stlong;andand, te&stlong;ament or o\u00feer di&slong;po&slong;icione, at the law lewys, may be maid; bot man aw to part with thir gudis glaidly, by the ordynance of god, as is befor &slong;aid. And thus he that &slong;uld de, &slong;uld gladly de, thinkand fore the better to lefe the were; and than the ded, pacyently tholyt, makis &slong;ati&slong;faccioune, nocht al-anerly of the vaneall &slong;ynys, bot als, quhen It is de&slong;yryt, fore \u00fee luf of god, and to be with hyme, for mony dedly &slong;ynis.  Bot the deuil tempis oft tymis mony men &slong;a in thar temporall gudis, at quhen thai ar in the hour of ded, thai will nocht here &slong;pek at thai &slong;yld de; the quhilk is our crewell to cri&stlong;in men to be tholyt.  And It is to vnder&stlong;and, at in thir temptaciouns the deuill may &stlong;ren&yogh;e na man, na &yogh;hit our-cum hyme, bot gyf It be his fre con&slong;ent, and be in his rycht mynde. And tharfor we &slong;uld thank god, at tholys ws nocht to be tempyt For\u00feer than we ma agane-&stlong;and; And we re&slong;i&stlong; his temptacions, we &slong;al have \u00feerfor gret reward in hevyne; and &slong;wa temptacions Is rycht prophetable tyll ws, for pur borne men cumys nocht to honore slepand, bot erar by gret trawell and dy&slong;es; and al man is born of the hewyne, bani&stlong; \u00feerof in pouertee, fore his &slong;ynis, redemyt thar-to agane by the faith and the pa&sslong;ione of cry&stlong;, he vynand the meryt \u00feerof by gud dedis and trew lawbor, or ell to remayne in that bana&slong;ing fore euer in hell.  Efter the dear be informyt of thir temptaciouns, at will be put to hyme, he &slong;uld be demandyt, Fyr&stlong;, gyf he be blycht at he deis in the faith of cri&stlong; and of haly kirk, and &slong;yne gyf he grantis at he has nocht leuit rycht wy&slong;ly, as he aucht to do, and gyf he forthinkis his my&slong;dedis, and gif he has wyll to mend thaim at his poware.  Syne &slong;uld he ask at hym, gyf he trowis that cri&stlong;, godis &slong;onne our lord, deit for hym, and al &slong;ynaris; and gif he thankes hyme thar of with al his hart, And gyf he trowis ony o\u00feer ways than be the faith of hym and ded to be &slong;auf.  Than byd hyme be &stlong;ark and &slong;ykir in that faith, and have hop of nan vthir thinge for temptacioune of the deuill: and gif thi &slong;ynis be laid befor the by the angell gud or Ill, &slong;ay than, \"the pa&sslong;ioune of cri&stlong; I put betuex me and my &slong;ynis, & betuex me and the eternall ded, the ded of cri&stlong;.\"  And al&slong;ua, he &slong;uld be examynit in the article of the treuth, that is to &slong;ay, gyf he trowis in the fa\u00feer, and in the &slong;one, and the haly gai&stlong;, and ane anerly god, makar of hevyne and erde; and in our lord Ihesu cri&stlong;, anerly &slong;one to god by natur, at our lady mary, euervyrgyne, con&slong;auit by \u00fee werkis of the haly gaist, but &slong;eid of man: the quhilk tholyt ded one the cor\u00df, for ws &slong;ynaris, and was grawyne and di&slong;cendyt to hell, to radem our elderis at had hope of his cumyne.
