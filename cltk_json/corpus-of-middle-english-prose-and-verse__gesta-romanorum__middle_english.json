But\nwhan the Emperour sawe this, he was gretely greued, for so moche yt he\nhated namely yt vyce / wherfore he commaunded anone, that frome that\ndaye / forth he sholde not be seen within his londe, vpon payne of\ndeth.  This herynge, his fomen gretely were gladded, and sayd vnto the\nolde knyght in this maner of wyse, \"Now be we delyuered of this knyght\nydrony.  There is no more to do but that we myght fynde ye waye and\nremedy, that we were delyuered of the\nnyghtyngale, in the whiche the Emperour delyteth so moche the songe.\"\nThan sayd this olde knyght, \"Your erys shall here & your eyen\nshall see, yt this nyghtyngale shall be destroyed in shorte tyme.\" Not\nlonge after, this olde knyght aspyed yt ye nyghtyngale vsed to sytte\nvpon a tree euyn aboue this same wel, where as her make, that was ye\nmake after the cours of nature, came and gendred with her. Neuerthelesse [in] the absence of her make,\nshe toke ofte tyme another make, & dyde auoutry / and whan she had\nthis done, than wolde she descende to the welle / and bathe her selfe, that whan her make come, he sholde fele no\nsauoure / ne euyll odoure of that she hadde done / whan the knyght had\nseen this, on a tyme he locked ye well; and whan the nyghtyngale wolde\nhaue descended to bathe her selfe after her auoutry, she found the\nwell closed; wherfore she fledde vp to the tree agayne, and mourned\nsore in her maner, and lefte of her swete songe.  Then came her make,\nand sawe that she had trespassed agaynst her nature; he wente agayne /\nand in shorte tyme he brought ayen a grete multytude of nyghtyngales,\nwhiche slewe his make, and tare her in smale gobettes / and thus was\nthe wyse knyght put awaye, and the nyghtyngale slayne / and the\nEmperour put and delyuered frome his pleasure and grete solace suche\nas he was wonte to haue. Moral. \u00b6 This Emperoure betokeneth our lorde Ihesu criste, the whiche\nloueth gretely the songe of perfyte deuocyon.  For whan we praye, we\nspeke with god, and whan we rede, god speketh with vs.  The welle,\nthat was in the palays, betokeneth confessyon that is in the chirche.\nTherfore yf ony man be dronken with synne / lete hym drynke on the\nwelle of confessyon / and with out doubte he shall be safe.  This\nydrony betokeneth euery man, that wylfully torneth agayne vnto synne\nafter his confessyon / lyke as a dogge whiche maketh a voment, and\ncasteth oute the mete that he hathe eten before / and after, whan he\nis hungry, cometh & eteth it agayne. Neuerthelesse yf a man that\nhath synned thus wyll drynke of the welle of confessyon, he shal\nreceyue his goostly strengthes.  The nyghtyngale, that satte on the\ntree, betokeneth ye soule, that sytteth on a tree of holy doctryne.\nAnd her songe betokeneth the soule, that sytteth on the tree in the\ndeuoute prayers to god.  But this soule dothe auoutry as ofte tymes as\nshe consenteth to synne. Neuerthelesse, yf she renne to confessyon,\nand bathe her with the water of contrycyon, god shall loue her.  But\nher fomen , whiche betokeneth the fendes of\nhelle, seynge this, yt god [is] soo mercyfull / they stoppe the welle\nof confessyon / that is to saye, the mouthes of men, that wolde shryue\ntheym selfe / with shame and with drede of theyr penaunce, that they\ndare not tell forth theyr synnes to theyr confessyon.  And thus ben\nmany exyled, and putte to dethe euerlastynge.  And therfore study we\nto bathe our lyfe in the welle of confessyon, with ye water of\ncontrycyon / and than may we\nbe sure to come to euerlastynge lyfe.  Unto the which I praye god\nbrynge both you and me!  Amen.", "7": {"0": "[XXXVII.]", "1": "Story. SOmtyme there dwelled in Rome a myghty emperour, the whiche was\nnamed Dunstane.  In whose Empyre dwelled a gentyll knyght, ye whiche\nhad two sones.  One of his sayd sones wedded hym selfe, agaynst his faders wyll, to a comune woman of\nthe bordell.  The knyght herynge this exyled his sone frome hym.  And\nwhan he was thus exyled, he begate on this woman a sone / and sone\nafter that, he wexed seke and nedefull, wherfore he sente messengers to his fader,\nbesechynge hym of his mercy.  This herynge, his fader had compassyon\nand ruthe of hym, wherfore he was reconsyled.  And whan he was thus\nbrought agayne to his faders grace / he gaue his sone, whiche he had\nbegoten afore of this nedeful woman, to his fader.  And he kyndely\nreceyued it as his sone, and norysshed tt. whan his other sone herde\nthis, he sayd to his fader, \"Fader,\" quod he,\n\"it semeth yt thou arte out of thy ryght mynde, the whiche I preue by\nthis reason. For he is out of his mynde, that receyueth a false heyre\n/ & nouryssheth hym / whose fader hath done hym anguysshe &\ndysease afore.  But my brother, whiche begate this chylde, hath done\nthe grete Iniurye, whan that he wedded ye comune woman agaynst thy\nwyll and commaundement.  Therfore me semeth, that thou arte oute of\nthy ryght mynde.\"  Thenne answered ye fader, and sayd, \"By cause that\nthy brother is reconsyled, thou arte enuyous to me, and also vnkynde\nto thyn owne brother / wyllynge for to put hym from my felawshyp for\neuermore / & sothely none vnkynde man shall haue myn herytage, but\nyf that he be reconsyled.  But yet yu were neuer reconsyled of his\nvnkyndenesse, for thou myght haue reconsyled hym, but thou woldest not\n/ therfore of myn herytage getest thou no parte. Moral. \u00b6 The fader of the two bretherne betokeneth the fader of\nheuen. And this two sones betokeneth ye nature of aungelles, and\nnature of man.  For man was wedded vnto a comune woman of the\nbordelle, whan he ete of the apple agaynst the commaundement of god,\nwherfore he was exyled by ye fader of heuen, and putte fro the Ioyes\nof paradyce.  The sone of the comune woman betokeneth mankynde. This\nknyghtes sone, that is to saye, Adam, began to be nedefull / for after\nhis synne he was putte from ioye in to this wretched valey of teares\nand wepynge, accordynge to this scrypture, In sudore vultus, &c.\nIn the swete of thy vysage thou shalte ete thy brede.  But after, by\nthe passyon of Cryste he was reconsyled.  But the other sone, whiche\nbetokeneth the deuyll, was euer vnkynde, & grutcheth dayly agaynst\noure reconsylynge, sayenge, that by synne we oughte not to come vnto the herytage\nof heuen.
