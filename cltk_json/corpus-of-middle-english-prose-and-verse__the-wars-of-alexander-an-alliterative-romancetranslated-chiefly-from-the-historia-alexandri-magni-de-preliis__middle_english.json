The remainder of the story may be briefly paraphrased as follows from the Historia de Preliis:\u2014 Alexander next causes a golden crown to be made, adorned with precious stones, with an inscription. A certain woman in Babylon is delivered of a monstrous child,\n  the upper half of which is born dead. A soothsayer tells Alexander that it signifies his approaching death. At that time there was a man in Macedon named Antipater, who conspired with others to kill Alexander. He designed to do so by poison. Antipater procures very strong poison, and sends it to his son Cassander. Cassander instructs his brother Roboas (whom Alex|ander loved, but had chidden for a slight fault) how to convey the poison to Alexander. Alexander makes a great feast in Babylon. Roboas puts the poison in a cup, and hands it to Alexander, who drinks it, and cries out, \"Help, help!\" In falling, his sword pierces his liver; yet he rises again, and bids his guests continue the feast. Alexander asks Cassander for a feather, to cause vomiting, and Cassander hands it to him, dipped in poison, which only increases the malady. Alexander passes a sleepless night, during which his lamp goes out. He crawls along on hands and knees to drown him|self in the Euphrates. Roxana stops him, and replaces him in his bed, lamenting. Alexander sends for a notary to make his will. The will instructs Aristotle to give a thousand talents of gold to the priests of Egypt. If Roxana gives birth to a boy, he is to be emperor; if to a girl, she is to be empress, married to some princely Macedonian, who is to be made emperor. Let Ptolemy have Egypt and marry Cleopatra; let Cleother have Ethiopia, Antiochus Syria, Arrideus Peloponnesus, Aristus India, Nicanor Seleucia, Ysmachas Hungary, Haulus Armenia, Lyochus Dalmatia and Sicily, Simon the notary Cappadocia and Pelagonia; lastly, let Cassander and Roboas have all as far as the river named Sol, and let their father Antipater have Cilicia. When the will was made, there followed thunders and lightnings and great earthquakes, and all the world knew that his death was near. The Macedonians crowd round the palace, demanding to see him, and to know who is to be his successor. He names Perdiccas, to whom he commends Roxana and all his soldiers. Then the Macedonians all begin to kiss him and to weep bitterly. Their lamentations are as low thunder, and even the sun is eclipsed. A certain Macedonian, named Solentius, asks what they shall do when Alexander is gone. They all deplore the great calamity, and think that the great empire will fall to ruins. Alexander directs his crown to be sent to the temple of Apollo, gives instructions for the embalming of his body, directs Ptolemy to erect to his memory a golden sepulchre in Alexandria, and dies. After his death, his princes dress the body in imperial state. He is conveyed to Alexandria, and buried in a costly tomb. Alexander was of middle height, with a long neck, bright eyes, and ruddy cheeks. The days of his life were thirty-two years and seven months. He began to war at eighteen, and in seven years subdued all the barbarian nations. He was born on the eighth of the kalends of January, and died on the fourth of the kalends of April. He built twelve cities (which are enumerated). Alexander's tomb was of gold. It was visited by philosophers, of whom the first said: \"Alexander has made his treasure of gold.\" The second said: \"Yesterday all the world was not enough for him; to-day four ells of it suffice him.\" The third: \"Yesterday he ruled the people, to-day the people rule him.\" The fourth: \"Yesterday he could deliver many from death, to-day he could not deliver him|self.\" The fifth: \"Yesterday he led an army out of the city, to-day he is led by it to his burial.\" The sixth: \"Yesterday he pressed the ground, to-day the ground presses on him.\" The seventh: \"Yesterday all nations feared him, to-day they despise him.\" The last: \"Yesterday he had both friends and enemies, to-day all men are alike to him.\" Compare the Gesta Romanorum, ed. Herrtage (E. E. T. S.), p 516, no. xxxi. [ Here ends the fragment in the Ashmole MS.]", "27": "The Story of Alexander.

And on a tyme he Come in-to a towne of hys awne, And sawe two men of \u00fee same towne bifore a iuge pletyng, of the which on said to \u00fee Iuge: \"Sir, I haue boght on house of thys man; And, long after, I haue founde in it a tresour vnder \u00fee erthe, which is nott myne.

And \u00feen he sayd: \"sir Iuge, that same tresour was neuer myne; but he hath edyfyed in \u00feat place that was byfore comyn to all \u00feoo that wold haue edyfyed ther-in. And \u00feerfore I haue no right to take it.\"\n  And \u00feen \u00feai both required \u00fee Iuge that he wold take it to hym-self; to qwom he answerd & sayd: \"sithen it is so that ye say that [ye] haue no right herto, ne he hath no right to whom \u00fee herytage hath longed and yet bylongeth whar \u00fee tresour was founden, how shuld I haue ony right \u00feerto, that am bot a straunger in that caas, And neuer afore herd speke \u00feerof? And ye wold excuse yow \u00feerof & yeue me \u00fee charge of \u00fee tresoure; which is euyll done.\" Thenne he askyd of \u00feaim \u00feat hed founde \u00fee tresour, whether thay had ony children? and \u00fee tone answerd & sayd, he hed a son: and [he] asked \u00feat other in like wyse, & he sayd, he hed a doghter.

And when Alexander herd \u00feis Iugement, The latter syllable ( ment ) is written in the middle of the lower margin of the leaf. Fol. 47 begins with he hed. he hed gret mervayle therof, and sayd \u00feus to \u00fee Iuge: \"I trowe \u00feer is nott in all \u00fee world so rightwise a Iuge as \u00feou art.\" And the Iuge, \u00feat knew hym nott, sayd & asked of hym whether ony Iuge in hys cuntree wold haue done otherwyse: \"ye, certanly,\" sayd alexander, \"in many landez.\" Thenne \u00fee Iuge, hauyng grete mervayll \u00feerof, asked of hym whether it rayned and \u00fee sone dyd shyne in tho landez; as he wold haue sayd, that it was mervayll \u00feat god shuld send ony light or rayne or other goode thyngez to them that do nott right & trew Iugement.
