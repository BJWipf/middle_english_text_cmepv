that were an horrible thynge bifore god / and eke a woman cowde nat plese to many folke at ones / and also ther sholde nevir be pease nor rest amonge hem ffor everiche wolde axe his owne thynge / [924] And ferther ovir no man sholde knowe his en|gendure nor who sholde haue his heritage and the woman sholde be the lasse bilevid fro the tyme that she were coniuncte to many men // [925] Nowe

experience day bi day ouht to suffice / [928] Also certes god ne made not woman off the foot of Adam ffor she ne shulde not be holden to lowe for she can nat paciently suffyr / but god made woman of the rybbe of Adam / ffor woman sholde be felaw vnto man / [929] man sholde bere hym vnto his wiff in feith and in trouth and in love as seith Seynt Poule / that man sholde love his wiff as crist lovith hooly cherche / that lovid it so wel that he dyed for hit / so sholde a man for his wiff yf hit were nede // [930] Nowe han a woman sholde be subiecte / Quomodo se haberet mulier erga maritum that tellith Seynt Petyr fyrst in obedi|ence [931] as seith the deere / A woman that is a wiff / as longe as she is a wiff she hath none auctorite to swere nor to bere witnes withoute leve off hir

above alle thynges she sholde love hir housbonde with alle hir herte and to hym to be trewe of her bodye / [938] so sholde an housbonde eke to his wiff / For sith that alle the bodye is the housbondes / so sholde hir herte b&emacr;n / or ellis bituexte hem too as in that is no parfite mariage / [939] Then shull ye vndir|stonde that for .iij. thynges a man and his wiff flesshly maye assemble / The first is the entente of engen|dure of childerne to the service of god / For certes that is the cause fynalle of matrimonye [940] Another cause is to yelden eueryche of hem to other the dette of her

also as seith the decre / that she hath meryte of chastite that yeldith to her housbonde the dette of hir bodie / ye thouh hit be ayen her lykyng atte the lust of hir hert // [942] The .iij. manere is

[945] These ben thoo that [h]an ben wyues. & han forgoon hir hous|bondes. and eke women that han doon leccherie & ben releued by penitence / [946] And certes if that a wife koude kepen hire all chaste by licence of hire housbonde. so that shee nere noon occasion that he agilte; it were to hire a grete merite / [947] These manere women that obseruen chastitee most be clene in herte. as wele as in body. & in thought. & mesurable in clothynge. & in countenaunce // Abstinent in etynge and drynkynge in spekyng & in dede / And thanne is she the vessell. or the boiste of the blessed Mawdelene. that fulfilleth holy chirche full of good odour // [948] The .iij. e manere of chastite is virginite. and it behoueth that she be holy in hert & clene of body / and than is she spouse to Ihesu criste and she is the lyfe of Aungels / [949] she is the preisyng of this world/. and she is as the&yogh; Martirs in egalite / she hath in hire that tunge may nat telle / [950] virginite bare oure lorde criste / & virgyn was hym // [951] A nother remedie agaynst leccherie is/ specially to withdrawe swiche thyngis as yeuen occasion to thilke vylenye as ease. etyng & drynkynge. For certes whan the potte boilleth strongely. the best remedye is to with|drawe the fuyr [952] Slepynge longe in grete quiete is eke a grete norise to leccherie // [953] A nother remedye agayns leccherie. is that a man or a woman eschew the compangny of hem of whiche he douteth to be tempted / For alle be it so. that the dede be withstonde; yet is there grete temptacion. [954] Soothly a whyt wal . al thogh it ne brenne nat fully by stynkyng of a Candle; yet is the walle blakke of the light [955] full ofte tyme I rede that no man triste in his owne perfeccion . but he be strenger than Sampson . or holier than Dauid/ or wiser than Salomon // [956] Now after that I haue declared yow as I kan . the seuen deedly synnes . & som of hire braunchis & hire remedies soothly if I coude .

[970] For he that ofte falle&yogh; in synne; he despised the mercy of god . & encresseth his synne & is vnkynde to criste / & he wexeth the more febl[e] to withstonde synne . & synneth the more lightly . [971] & the latter aryseth . & is the more eschewe for to schryue hym . and namely to hym that hath ben his con|fessour / [972] For whiche that folke whan that they fallen agayn in hire olde folyes . other they leten hire olde confessours al outrely . or they departen hire shryfte in dyuers places / but soothly swiche departed shrifte deserueth no mercy of god of his synnes // [973] The sixte circum|staunce is . why that a man synneth . a[s] by whiche tempta|cion . & if hym selfe procure thilke temptacioun or by the ex|citynge of other folke / or if he synne with a woman [b]y force / or by hire owne assente . [974] or if the woman maugre hire hed[e] hath be aforced or noon this shalle she telle / for couetise / or for pouerte / & if it was hire procurynge or noon / & swiche maner harneys // [975] The seuenthe circumstaunce is in what maner he h[ath] doon his synne / & how that she hath suffred that folke han [doon] to hire / [976] The same shalle the man tellen pleynly with alle [cir]cumstaunces . & whether he hath synned with comoun borde[l] women or noon / [977] or doon his synne in holy tymes or noon / or by forn his shrifte / or after his lattere shryfte / [978] & hath parauenture broken therfore his penaunce enyoyned / by whoos helpe & whoos counseile . bi sorcerie or crafte al moste be tolde / [979] Alle these thynges after that they ben grete or smale . engreggen the conscience of man . & eke the preest . that is thy Iuge may the better ben auysed of hise Iugement . in yeuynge of thy penaunce . and [t]hat is after thy contricioun / [980] For vnderstonde wele that after tyme that a man hath defouled his bapteme by synne . if he wole come to sauacioun . ther is noon other wey . but be penitence and shrifte & be satisfaccioun / [981] & namely by the twoo // If ther be a confessour to whiche he may shryue hym / And the Thridde if he haue lyfe to performe it / [982] Thanne shalle men loke & considere if he wole make a trewe & profitable confessioun; ther moste ben iiij. condiciouns // [983] Firste it mote ben in sorwefull bitternesse of herte / As seide te kynge Ezechiel to god / I wole remembre me alle the yeres of my lyfe in bitternesse of myn herte / [984] This condicion of bitter|nesse hath .v. signes // The firste is that confession moste be shamefaste nat for to kouere ne hide his synne / but for he hath agilte his god & defouled his soule / [985] And here of seith seint Augustyn / The herte trauailleth for shame of his synne / And for he hath grete shame-fastnesse / he is digne to haue grete mercy of god / [986] Swiche was y e confessioun of the publican . that wolde nat heue vp his eyen to heuen . For he hadde offended god of heuen / For whiche shamefastnesse; he had a noon the mercy of god / [987] And therfore seyth seint Augustyn that swiche shamefaste folke ben nexte foryefnesse & remission // [988] Another signe is humylite of Confession / Of which seith seint Petir: humbleth yow vnder the myght of god / the hond of god is myghty in confession; For therby god foryeueth the synnes For he allone hath the power / [989] And this humylyte shall ben in hert & in signe outwarde / For right as he hath humylyte to god in hert; right so sholde he humble his body outwarde to the preest thatte sitte in goddis place / [990] For whiche in no maner sith that criste ys souereyn & the preest mene & mediatour bi|twixe criste & the synnere / & the synner is the laste by wey of reson / [991] thanne sholde nat the synner sitte as hye as his confessours. but knele byforn hym. or at his feet. but if maladye distorbed it / For he shalle nat take kepe who sitte there. but in whoos place that he sitteth // [992] A man that hath trespased to a lorde / & cometh for to axe mercy & maken his acorde & sette hym doun by the lorde; men wolde holden hym outrageous & nat worthy so sone for to haue remission ne mercy [993] The thridde signe is. that thy shrifte sholde be full of teeris. if men may. & if he may nat wepe with his bodely eyen; late hym wepe in his herte / [994] swiche was the confession of seint Petir / For after that he hadde forsake ihesu criste; he wente oute & weepe bitterly [995] The ferthe signe is / that he ne lette nat for his shame to shewe his confession / [996] Swiche was the confession of the Mawdeleyne that ne spared for no shame of hem that weren atte feste for to goo to oure lorde ihesu criste & byknowe to hym hir synne // [997] The fifte signe is that a man or woman be obeissaunt to receyue the penaunz that hym is enyoyned / For certes Ihesu criste for the giltes of o man was obedient to his deeth / [998] The seconde condicion of verrey confession is that it be hastely don / For certes if a man hadde a dedly wounde. euer the lenger that he tarieth to warisse hym selfe the more wolde it corrupte & haste hym to his deeth / and eke y e wounde woude be the werse for to hele / [999] And right so farith synne. that longe tyme is in a man vnshewid / [1000] Certe a man ough[t] hastely shewyn his synnes For many causes. as for drede of deth that ofte sodeynly. And in no certeyne what tyme it shal be ne in what place / & eke the drecchyng of o synne draweth in a noth[er] [1001] And eke the lenger he tarieth; the forther he is fro criste. And if he abide vnto his laste day; scarsly may he shryue hym or re|membre hym of his synnes. or repente for the greuous malad[ye] of his deeth. [1002] And for as myche as he hath nat in his lyfe herkened Ihesu criste . . . . . no gap in the MS. at his laste day & scarsly wole he herkene hym [1003] And vndirstonde that this condicion moste haue .iiij. thynges // // Thy shrifte moste be purueyd by-forn and auysed / For wikked haste dooth noo profite. And that a man konne shryue hym of his synnes. be it of pride or enuye. & so forth. with the spices & circumstaunces / [1004] and that he haue comprehended in his mynde the nombre & the grettenes of his synnes and how longe that he hath leyn in synne [1005] & eke that he be contryte of hise synnes and in stedefaste purpos by the grace of god neuer eft to falle in synne // And eke that he drede. & countrewaite hym selfe & that he flee the occasions of synne to whiche he is enclyned // [1006] Also that thow shalte shryue the of alle thy synnes to oo man // And nat a parce[l] to oo man. & nat a parcel to a nother. that is to vndirstonde in entent to departe thy confessioun as for shame or drede / For it nys butte stranglynge of thy soule / [1007] For certis Ihesu criste is intierly al good & in hym is noon inperfeccion / And therfore outher he foryeueth alle parfitly. or elles neuer a dele. [1008] I sey nat that if thow be assigned to the penitauncer for certeyn synne / that thow arte bounde too shewe hym alle the remenaunt of thy synnes of whiche thow haste be shreuen of thy curate / but if it lyke the of thyn humylite this is noo departynge of thy shrifte. [1009] Ne I ne sey nat ther as I speke of dyuiysioun of confes|sion. that if thow haue licence for to shryue the to a discreet & an honest preest where thee lyketh / & eke by the licence of thy curat that thow ne maiste wele shryue the to hym of alle thy synnes / [1010] but late noo blot byhynde / ne late noo synne vntoolde. Asfer as thow hastee remem|braunce / [1011] And whan thow shalte be shryue to thy curat. telle hym alle thy synne that thow haste doon / sith thowe were laste y-shryuen / Al this is no wikked intente of dyuysion of shrifte // [1012] Also the verrey shrifte axeth certeyne con|dicions [F]yrste that thow shryue the by thy free wille nat constrayned. ne for shame of folke. ne for maladie or swiche thynges / For it is reson that he that trespaseth by his free wille; he mote be his free wille confesse his trespace / [1013] Noon other man shalle tellen his synne but he hym selfe / Ne he shal nat naite or denye his synne. ne wrath hym agayn the preest for hise amonestynge to lete synne // [1014] The secound condicion is / that thy shryfte be laweful. that is to seyn that thow that shryuest the & eke the preste that hureth thy confession be verrely in the feith of holy chirche [1015] And that a man ne be nat despeired of the mercye of Ihesu criste as kaym or Iudas / [1016] And eke a man mote accuse hym selfe of his owne trespace / & nat a nother / but he shalle blame .and. wite hym selfe & his owne malice of his synne & noon other / [1017] But natheles but if a nother man be occasion or enticere of his synne or that the estate of a persone be swiche. thurgh whiche his synne is agreggyd / or ellys that he may nat pleynly shryue hym hym but he telle the persone with whiche he hath synned; than may he telle it. [1018] so that his entente be nat to bakbite the .persone. but oonly to declaren his con|fession / [1019] Thow ne shalte natte eke make no lesynges in thy confessioun for humylite / parauenture to seyn that thow haste doon synnes. of whiche thow were neuer gilti // [1020] For seint Augustyn seith. yf thow be cause of humylite makest lesynges on thy selfe thogh that thow ne were nat in synne byforn; yet arte thow thanne in synne thurgh thy lesynges // [1021] Thow moste eke shewe thy synnes by thyn owne propre Mouth / but if thow be woxen dombe. & nat be no lettre // for thow haste doon the synne; thow shalte haue the shame // [1022] [T]how shalte nat eke peynte thy confession by faire subtile wordes [to] kouere the moore thy synne / For thanne bygyleste thow thy selfe [a]nd nat the preest / Thow most telle it platly. be it neuer so foule ne so horrible // [1023] Thow shalte eke shryue the to a preest / that is discrete to counseile the // And eke thow shalt nat shryue thee for veyn glorie. ne for ypocrisie. ne for no cause. but only for the doute of Ihesu criste & the hele of thy soule // [1024] Thow shalt nat eke renne to the preest sodeynly to telle hym lyghtly thy synne. as who so telleth a Iape / or a tale / but auysely & with grete deuocion / [1025] and generally shryue the ofte. if thow ofte falle; ofte thow aryse be confession / [1026] And though thow shryue the ofter thanne ones of synne of whiche thow haste be shryuen. it is the more meryte / And as seith seint Augustyn. thow shalt haue the more lightly relesyng & grace of god bothe of synne & of peyne / [1027] And certes oones in a yere atte leste weye it is lawefull / for to ben housled / for soothly onys a yere. alle thynges renouellen. [1028] Now haue I tolde of verrey con[fes]sion that is the seconde partie of penitence De tercia parte penitencie [1029] The thridde partie of penitence is Satisffaccion. And that stant generally in almesse. & bodely peyne // [1030] Now ben there .iij. maner of Almesses. Contricion of herte. where a man offreth hym selfe to god /. Another is to haue pite of his neighebores / The thridd[e] is in yeuynge good counseile & comfort goostly & bodyly where men han nede. and namely in sustenaunce of mannes foode // [1031] And take kep[e] a man hath nede of these thynges. generally he hath nede of fode // h[e] hath nede of clothynge & herberwe / he hath nede of charitable conseile & visytynge in prison. & Maladie. & sepulture of his dede body / [1032] And if thow maist nat visite the needfull with thy personee visite hym by thy message and thy yeftes / [1033] These ben general almesses or werkys of charite of hem that han temporel rechesse or discrecion in conseillynge / Of these werkes shaltow heren at the day of dome // [1034] These Almesses shaltow doon of thynne owne propre thynges & hastyfly and priuely if thow maiste / [1035] But natheles if thou maist nat do pryuely; thow shalt nat forbere to doon thyn almesse. though men se it. so that it be nat doon for thanke of y e worlde but oonly for thanke of Ihesu criste. [1036] For as witnesseth sei[nt] Mathew .5 to . A cite may nat ben hydde that is sette on a Mountayne ne men lyght nat a lanterne. & putte it vnder a busshel. but men. se[t] it on a Candel|styke to lyghten the men in the hous // [1037] Ryght soo

fastynges & in v[er]tuouse techynges of orisons // [1039] ye shulle vndirstonde that orison[s] or preiers is for to seyn. a pitous wille of herte that redresse [ MS. torn ] god & expressith it by worde outwarde to remoeue harmes. & t[o] han thynges espirituel & durable. and somtyme temporel thynges / [of] whiche orisons. certes in the orison of the Pater noster. hath Ihesu criste enclosed moost thynges // [1040] Certes it is priuelegged of .iij. thynges in his dignite / for whiche it is more digne / thanne any other praier for Ihesu criste hym selfe maked it / [1041] And it is short For it sholde be koude the more lightly / And forto witholde it the more esely in herte / & helpen hym selfe the oftere with the orison / [1042] & for a man sholde be the lasse wery to sey it / And for a man may nat excuse hym to lerne it. it is so shorte. & so esy / And for it comprehendeth in it sel[f] alle gode preiers / [1043] The exposicion of this holy praiere / that is so excellent &

hit avayleth eeke ageyne the vices of the soule / For as seyth Seynt Ierome / bi fastynge bene savid the vices of the flesshe / and by prayer the vices of the soule // [1048] Aftyr this thou shalt
