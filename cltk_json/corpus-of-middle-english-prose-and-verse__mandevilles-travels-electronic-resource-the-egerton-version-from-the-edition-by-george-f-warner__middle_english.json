Qwha so wil ga langer tyme on \u00fee see and com nere to Ierusalem, he schall go fra Cipre by see vnto porte\nJaff, for \u00feat es \u00fee next hauen to Ierusalem.

And he sall ga to \u00fee citee of Acon, Acre, Akka, or Acco Ptolemais, 27 miles south of Tyre. \u00feat was sum tyme called Tholomayda, a day iournee fra Tyre. And it was a citee of Cristen men sum tyme, bot\nnow it es destruyd for \u00fee maste party. And fra Venice til Acon es by see ii m and iiij xx 2080 myle of Lumbardy;\nand fra Calabre, or fra Cicil, til Acon es i m and ccc. myle.

And sum saise \u00feat it es a swelgh of \u00fee Grauelly See. Men commes fra ferre cuntreez with schippes by see\nand with cartes by land to fecche of \u00feat grauell. Also fra Acon before said gase men three day iournez to \u00fee citee of Palestyne, \u00feat now es called Gaza, and\nit es a full faire citee and full of ricches and of folk. Fra \u00feis citee til a hill withoute bare Sampson \u00fee forte \u00fee\n&yogh;ates of \u00fee citee, \u00fee whilk ware made of brasse.

Qwham his bro\u00feer gert sla priuely and regned in his steed, and gert call him Melechimandabron. And he \u00feat was sowdan when I parted oute\nof \u00feat land. \u00dee sowdan may lede oute of Egipte ma \u00fean xx m men of armes; and oute of \u00fee rewme of Surry and of Turky,\nand oute of o\u00feer rewmes \u00feat er vnder his subieccion he may bring ma \u00fean l. thousand men of armes. And all\n\u00feai take \u00feaire wagez and all \u00feat \u00feaim nedes of \u00fee sowdan, \u00feat es to say ilk ane of \u00feam takes &yogh;erely vi xx florenes;\nbot ilk ane of \u00feam buse hald three horses and a camell.

And for \u00fei, when \u00fee sowdan lykes to avaunce any man of gude \u00feat es with him, he makes\nhim ane admyrall. And if any derth com in \u00fee cuntree, \u00fean pure knyghtes and sodyours selles \u00feaire hernays\nfor mischeeffe. \u00dee sowdan has three wyfes, of \u00fee whilke ane sall be a Cristen womman and \u00fee o\u00feer twa Sarezenes. iiii. wyfes, on Cristene and iii.

And, ay when him list, he\ngase to visit \u00feam, and vmqwhyle ledes \u00feam aboute with him. Noght for\u00fei he has lemmanes, als many as him list\nhaue; for, when he comes till any citee or toune, he gers bring before him all \u00fee nobilest and \u00fee fairest\nmaydens of \u00fee cuntree nere aboute, and he gers \u00feam be keped honestly and wirschipfully. And, when he will hafe any of \u00feam, he gers \u00feaim all be broght before him, and wha so es maste lykand till him, he sendes till hir\nor takes \u00fee ryng off his fynger and castez till hir. And \u00fean sall scho be tane and waschen and bawmed and\nwirschipfully cledd and after souper be broght till his chaumbre. And \u00feus he duse ay when he will. Before\n\u00fee sowdan sall na straunger com \u00feat he ne sall be cledd in clathe of gold or tars or in chamelet, a maner of\nclething whilk \u00fee Sarzenes vsez. And als sone as he has sight of \u00fee sowdan, be it at wyndow or elleswhare, him\nbehoues knele doune and kisse \u00fee erthe; for swilk es \u00fee maner \u00feare to do reuerence to \u00fee sowdan, when any\nman will speke with him. And, when any straungers commes till him in message oute of ferre landes, his men\nsall stand aboute him with drawen swerdes in handes, and \u00feer handes vp on loft, to stryke \u00feam doune, if \u00feai\nspeke any thing \u00feat displesez \u00fee sowdan. \u00deare sall na straunger com before him for to ask him any thing \u00feat ne\nhis asked sall be graunted him, if it be resounable and no&yogh;t agayne \u00feaire lawe. And ri&yogh;t so duse all o\u00feer princez\n\n \nand lordes in \u00feat cuntree; for \u00feai say \u00feat na man suld com before a prince \u00feat he ne schuld passe gladder away\n\u00fean he come \u00feiderward. And wit &yogh;e wele \u00feat \u00feis Babiloyne of whilk I speke now, whare \u00fee sowdan es dwelland, es no&yogh;t \u00fee grete\nBabilon, whare \u00fee confusioun of tunges was made, when \u00fee toure of Babilon was in makyng; \u00fee walles of \u00fee\nwhilk ware lxiiii. furlanges hye, and it es in \u00fee desertes of Araby, as men gase toward \u00fee kyngdom of Caldee.\nBot it es lang sen any durst com nere \u00feat wricched place; for it es waste and so full of dragouns and nedders\nand o\u00feer venymous bestes, \u00feat \u00feare dare na man com nere it. \u00dee sercle of \u00fee toure with \u00fee compas of \u00fee citee \u00feat was \u00feare sum tyme contenes xxv. myle aboute, as \u00feai say \u00feare in \u00feat cuntree. And if all it be called a\ntoure, \u00feare ware sum tyme within it many faire edificaciouns, \u00fee whilk er now destruyd and no&yogh;t bot wilderness.\nAnd &yogh;e schall vnderstand \u00feat it was made foure square, and ilka and \u00feat tour conteyned gret contree in circuyt, for the tour allone conteyned x. myle sqware, C . square contened sex myle and mare. \u00deis ilke\ntoure made Nemprot, \u00feat was kyng of \u00feat land; and men saise \u00feat he was \u00fee first erthely kyng \u00feat euer was.\nHe gert also make ane ymage in mynde of his fader, and comaundid all his subgetes to wirschippe \u00feat ymage.\nOn \u00fee same wyse did o\u00feer grete lordes aboute; and on \u00feis maner began ydolatry first. \u00deat ilke citee of grete\nBabilon was sette in a faire playne, \u00fee whilk was called Sennaar felde, apon \u00fee ryuer of Eufrates, \u00feat ran thurgh\n\u00fee citee \u00feat tyme. And \u00fee walles of \u00fee citee ware cc. cubites hie and l. cubites thikk. Bot efterward Syrus, \u00fee\nkyng of Perse, withdrew \u00fee water and destruyd \u00fee citee and all \u00fee cuntree \u00feare aboute. He departed \u00fee grete\nriuer of Eufrates, and gert it rynne in ccc. and xl. diuerse ways.

And \u00fee cause was for in \u00feat ryuer \u00feer ware oft tymes many of his worthiest men\ndrouned. Fra \u00feat Babilon \u00feer \u00fee Sowdan dwelles for to passe north este to \u00fee grete Babilon er xl. day iourneez\nthurgh deserte. And \u00feat Babilon es no&yogh;t in \u00fee subieccioun of \u00fee Sowdan, bot within \u00fee lordschippe of \u00fee kyng\nof Perse. And it es halden of \u00fee grete Caan, \u00fee whilk es a grete emperour, &yogh;a \u00fee grettest of \u00fee werld, for he es lord of \u00fee grete Ile of Cathay and of many o\u00feer cuntreez, and of a grete party of Inde.

Of his grete state and magestee I think to speke afterwardes,\nwhen I com \u00feerto. In \u00fee grete desertes of Araby es \u00fee citee of Meek, Mecca. and \u00feare ligges \u00fee body of Machomete full wirschipfully\nin a temple \u00feat \u00fee Sarezenes calles Musket. Mosque.

And he was successour of Macomete\nand of his kynredyn. \u00deis citee of Baldak was sum tyme called Susis, Susa. Its identification with Baghdad is, of course, an error. and Nabugodonosor founded it. \u00deare\ndwelled Danyel \u00fee prophete, and sawe oft tymes many visiouns of Godd; and \u00feare he interpretid \u00fee kynges\ndremes. Fra A passage in the French text is omitted here; it is given in C , beginning, \"And in old tyme \u00feere were wont to be iii.

At \u00feis citee the ryuer of Nilus enters in\nto \u00fee see, as I talde before. And in \u00feat ryuer er oft tymes funden many precious stanes, and of \u00fee tree \u00feat men\ncallez Aloes, \u00fee whilk commes oute of Paradys.

Now Preceded in C (f.26) by a rubric, as follows: \"Of the weye that goth from Babiloyne vnto the mownt Synay and of the merueyles \u00feere.\" The matter, however, is covered by the rubric of chp. viii. will I tell what way men schall hald fra Babilon to \u00fee mount Synai, whare \u00fee body of Sayn Kateryne\nlyes. Men behoues passe thurgh \u00fee desertes of Araby, whare Moyses and Aaron ledd \u00fee folk of Israel.

Fra \u00feis vale vnto \u00fee mount Synai es\nbot a day iournee. Qwha so will go ano\u00feer way fra Babilon to \u00fee mount Synai, him behoues passe by \u00fee Reed See, whilk es\nane arme of \u00fee west see, the see occean, C . whare thurgh \u00fee childer of Israel went drye fote, when kyng Pharao persued \u00feam, and in \u00fee whilk he and all his oste ware drouned.

Sardenak men commez thurgh \u00fee vale of Bochar, \u00fee whilk es a faire vale and a plentifous of all\nmaner of fruyte; and it es amanges hilles. And \u00feer er \u00fearin faire ryuers and grete medews and noble pasture\nfor bestez. And men gas by \u00fee mountes of Libane, whilk lastez fra Ermony \u00fee mare towardes \u00fee north vnto Dan, \u00fee whilk es \u00fee end of \u00fee land of repromissioun toward \u00fee north, as I said before. \u00deir hilles er ri&yogh;t\nfruytfull, and \u00feare er many faire welles and cedres and cipressez, and many o\u00feer treesse of diuerse kyndes. \u00deare\ner also many gude tounes toward \u00fee heued of \u00feir hilles, full of folk.

Fra \u00feeine men commez by a citee \u00feat es called Beruch, Beyrout. whare sayne George slew \u00fee\ndragoun; and it es a gude toune, and a faire castell \u00feerin, and it es iii. iournez fra \u00fee forsaid citee of Sardenak.\n\n \nAt \u00fee ta syde of Beruch xvi. myle, to comme hiderward, es \u00fee citee of Sydon. At Beruch entres pilgrimes in to\n\u00fee see \u00feat will comme to Cipre, and \u00feai aryfe at \u00fee porte of Surry or of Tyer, and so \u00feai comme to Cipre in a\nlytill space. Or men may comme fra \u00fee porte of Tyre and comme no&yogh;t at Cipre and aryfe at sum hauen of Grece,\nand so comme to \u00feise partyse, as I said before. I hafe talde &yogh;ow now of \u00fee waye by whilk men gase ferrest and langest to Ierusalem, as by Babilon and\nmount Synay and many o\u00feer placez whilk &yogh;e herd me tell off, and also by whilk ways men schall turne agayne to\n\u00fee Land of Repromission. Now will I tell &yogh;ow \u00fee rightest way and \u00fee schortest to Ierusalem. For sum men will\nno&yogh;t ga \u00fee to\u00feer; sum for \u00feai hafe no&yogh;t spending ynogh, sum for \u00feai hafe na gude cumpany, and sum for \u00feai may\nno&yogh;t endure \u00fee lang trauail, sum for \u00feai drede \u00feam of many perils of desertes, sum for \u00feai will haste \u00feam\nhameward, desirand to see \u00feare wifes and \u00feare childer, or for sum o\u00feer resonable cause \u00feat \u00feai hafe to turne sone\nhame. And \u00feerfore I will schew how men may passe tittest, and in schortest tyme make \u00feaire pilgrimage to\nIerusalem. A man \u00feat commes fra \u00fee landes of \u00fee west, he gas thurgh Fraunce, Burgoyne, and Lumbardy, and\nso to Venice or Geen, or sum o\u00feer hauen, and schippes \u00feare and wendez by see to \u00fee ile of Greff, \u00fee whilk\npertenez to \u00fee Ianuenes. And seyne he aryuez in Grece at Porte Mirrok, or at Valoun, or at Duras, or at sum\no\u00feer hauen of \u00feat cuntree, and ristez him \u00feare and byez him vitailes and schippez agayne and sailez to Cipre\nand aryuez \u00feare at Famagost and commez no&yogh;t at \u00fee ile of Rodes.

Fra \u00fee porte Iaffe men gase to \u00fee citee of Rames, \u00fee whilk es bot a\nlytill \u00feeine; and it es a faire citee and a gude and mykill folk \u00feerin. And withouten \u00feat citee toward \u00fee south\nes a kirk of oure Lady, whare oure Lord schewed him till her in three cloudes, \u00fee whilk betakned \u00fee Trinitee.\nAnd a lytill \u00feeine es ane o\u00feer citee, \u00feat men calles Dispolis, bot it hight sum tyme Lidda, a faire citee and a\nwele inhabited; \u00feare es a kirk of sayne George, whare he was heuedid. Fra \u00feeine men gase to \u00fee castell of\nEmaus, and so to \u00fee Mount Ioy; \u00feare may pilgrimes first see to Ierusalem. At Mount Ioy liggez Samuel \u00fee\nprophete. Fra \u00feeine men gase to Ierusalem. Beside \u00feir ways es \u00fee citee of Ramatha and \u00fee mount Modyn;\n\n \nand \u00feeroff was Matathias, Iudas Machabeus fader, and \u00feare er \u00fee graues of \u00fee Machabeez. Be&yogh;ond Ramatha es\n\u00fee towne of Techue, wharoff Amos \u00fee prophete was; and \u00feare es his grafe. I hafe talde &yogh;ow before of \u00fee haly placez \u00feat er at Ierusalem and aboute it, and \u00feerfore I will speke na\nmare of \u00feam at \u00feis tyme. Bot I will turne agayne and schewe &yogh;ow o\u00feer ways a man may passe mare by land,\nand namely for \u00feaim \u00feat may no&yogh;t suffer \u00fee sauour of \u00fee see, bot es leuer to ga by land, if all it be \u00fee mare payne.\nFra a man be entred in to \u00fee see he schall passe till ane of \u00fee hauenes of Lumbardy, for \u00feare es \u00fee best making of purueaunce of vitailes; or he may passe to Ieen or Venice or sum o\u00feer. And he sall passe by see in to\nGrece to \u00fee porte Mirrok, or to Valoun, or to Duras, or sum o\u00feer hauen of \u00feat cuntree. And fra \u00feeine he sall\nga by land to Constantinople, and he sall passe \u00fee water \u00feat es called Brace Sayne George, \u00fee whilk es ane arme\nof \u00fee see. And fra \u00feeine he sall by land ga to Ruffynell, whare a gude castell es and a strang; and fra \u00feeine he\nsall ga to Pulueral, and seyne to \u00fee castell of Synople, and fra \u00feeine to Capadoce, \u00feat es a grete cuntree, whare\ner many grete hilles. And he sall ga thurgh Turky to \u00fee porte of Chiutok and to \u00fee citee of Nyke, whilk es\nbot vii. myle \u00feeine. \u00deat citee wanne \u00fee Turkes fra \u00fee emperour of Constantinople; and it es a faire citee and\nwele walled on \u00fee ta syde, and on \u00fee to\u00feer syde es a grete lake and a grete riuer, \u00fee whilk es called Lay.\nFra \u00feeine men gase by \u00fee hilles of Nairmount and by \u00fee vales of Mailbrins and straite felles and by \u00fee toune of\nOrmanx or by \u00fee tounes \u00feat er on Riclay and Stancon, \u00fee whilk er grete waters and noble, and so to Antioche\n\u00fee lesse, whilk es sett on \u00fee ryuer of Riclay. And \u00feare aboutes er many gude hilles and faire, and many faire\nwodes and grete plentee of wylde bestes for to hunt at. And he \u00feat will ga ano\u00feer way, he schall ga by \u00fee playnes of Romany costayand \u00fee Romayn See. On \u00feat\ncoste es a faire castell \u00feat men callez Florach, and it es right a strang place. And vppermare amanges \u00fee mountaynes es a faire citee, \u00feat es called Toursout, and \u00fee citee of Longemaath, and \u00fee citee of Assere, and \u00fee\ncite of Marmistre. And, when a man es passed \u00fease mountaynes and \u00fease felles, he gase by \u00fee citee of\nMarioch and by Artoise, whare es a grete brigg apon \u00fee riuer of Ferne, \u00feat es called Farfar, and it es a grete\nriuer berand schippes and it rynnes ri&yogh;t fast oute of \u00fee mountaines to \u00fee cite of Damasc. And besyde \u00fee citee\nof Damasc es ano\u00feer grete riuer \u00feat commes fra \u00fee hilles of Liban, whilk men callez Abbana. At \u00fee passing of\n\u00feis riuer saynt Eustace, \u00feat sum tyme was called Placidas, lost his wyf and his twa childer. \u00deis riuer rynnes\n\n \nthurgh \u00fee playne of Archades, and so to \u00fee Reed See. Fra \u00feeine men gase to \u00fee cite of Phenice, whare er hate\nwelles and hate bathez. And \u00fean men gase to \u00fee cite of Ferne; and betwene Phenice and Ferne er x. myle.\nAnd \u00feare er many faire woddes. And \u00fean men commez til Anthioche, whilk es x. myle \u00feeine. And it es a\nfaire citee and wele walled aboute with many faire toures; and it es a grete cite, bot it was sum tyme gretter\n\u00fean it es nowe. For it was sum tyme twa myle on lenth and on brede o\u00feer half myle. And thurgh \u00fee myddes\nof \u00feat citee ranne \u00fee water of Farphar and a grete brigg ower it; and \u00feare ware sum tyme in \u00fee walles aboute\n\u00feis citee ccc. and fyfty toures, and at ilk a piler of \u00fee brigg was a toure. \u00deis es \u00fee cheeffe cite of \u00fee kyngdom of\nSurry. And ten myle fra \u00feis cite es \u00fee porte of Saynt Symeon; and \u00feare gase \u00fee water off Farphar in to \u00fee see.\nFra Antioche men gase to a cite \u00feat es called Lacuth, and \u00fean to Gebel, and \u00fean to Tortouse. And \u00feare nere es \u00fee land of Channel; and \u00feare es a strang castell \u00feat es called Maubek. Fra Tortouse passez men to Tryple\nby see, or elles by land thurgh \u00fee straytes of mountaynes and felles. And \u00feare es a citee \u00feat es called Gibilet. Fra\nTriple gase men til Acres; and fra \u00feeine er twa ways to Ierusalem, \u00fee tane on \u00fee left half and \u00fee to\u00feer on \u00fee\nri&yogh;t half. By \u00fee left way men gase by Damasc and by \u00fee flum Iordan. By \u00fee ri&yogh;t way men gase by Maryn and\nby \u00fee land of Flagramy and nere \u00fee mountaynes vnto \u00fee cite of Cayphas, \u00feat sum men callez \u00fee Castell of\nPilgrimes. And fra \u00feeine to Ierusalem er iii. day iournez, in \u00fee whilk men schall ga thurgh Cesaria Philippi,\nand so to Iaffe and Rames and \u00fee castell of Emaus, and so to Ierusalem. Now hafe I talde &yogh;ow sum ways by land and by water \u00feat men may ga by to \u00fee Haly Land after \u00fee cuntreez\n\u00feat \u00feai comme fra. Neuer\u00feeles \u00feai comme all til ane ende. &YOGH;it es \u00feare ano\u00feer way to Ierusalem all by land, and\npasse no&yogh;t \u00fee see, fra Fraunce or Flaundres; bot \u00feat way es full lang and perlious and of grete trauaile, and\n\u00feerfore few gase \u00feat way. He \u00feat schall ga \u00feat way, he schall ga thurgh Almayne and Pruyss and so to Tartary.\n\u00deis Tartary es halden of \u00fee Grete Caan of Cathay, of wham I think to speke efterward. \u00deis es a full ill land\nand sandy and lytill fruyt berand. For \u00feare growes na corne, ne wyne, ne beenes, ne peese, ne nan o\u00feer fruyt\ncouable to man for to liffe with. Bot \u00feare er bestez in grete plentee; and \u00feerfore \u00feai ete bot flesch withouten breed and soupez \u00fee broo, and \u00feai drink mylke of all maner of bestez. \u00deai ete The lacuna in C ends here. cattes and hundes, ratouns and\nmyesse, and all o\u00feer maner of bestez; and, for \u00feai hafe lytill wode, \u00feai dight warmen and sethen, C . \u00feaire mete with dung of bestez\ndried at \u00fee sonne. \u00deai ete bot anes on \u00fee day, now\u00feer prince nor o\u00feer; and &yogh;it \u00feat anes \u00feai ete bot ri&yogh;t lytill.\n\u00deai er ri&yogh;t foule folk and fell and full of malice. \u00deat cuntree es selden withouten grete tempestez.

And ri&yogh;t sodaynely es \u00feare\nchaungeyng of \u00fee aer, nowe grete calde and now grete hete; and so \u00feare es euill dwelling. \u00dee prince \u00feat\ngouernes \u00feat land es called Baco, and he dwellez in a citee \u00feat men callez Orda. Sothely \u00feare will\nna gude manne dwell in \u00feat land; for it es gude to sawe in humbloks and nettles and swilk o\u00feer wedes,\nand o\u00feer gude nane, For the lond and the contree is not worthi houndes to duell inne. It were a gode contree to sowen inne thristell and breres and broom and thornes and breres, and for non o\u00feer \u00feing is it not good, C . as I hafe herd say, for I hafe no&yogh;t bene \u00feare.

Bot I went neuer by \u00feat way to Ierusalem, and \u00feerfore I may no&yogh;t wele tell it. But, &yogh;if this matiere plese to ony worthi man \u00feat hath gon be \u00feat weye, he may telle it, &yogh;if him lyke, to \u00feat entent \u00feat \u00feo \u00feat wolen go by \u00feat weye and maken here viage be \u00feo costes mowen knowen what weye is \u00feere, adds C .

Of swilk way schall a man ga iii. day iournez fra Pruyss are he comme to \u00fee land of Sarezens habitable, whare Sarzenes dwellez.

And Dauid also beres witnes \u00feeroff, \u00feare he saise, Deus autem rex noster\nante secula operatus est salutem in medio terre , Ps. lxxiii. 12. \u00feat es to say, \"Godd oure kyng before \u00fee begynnyng of \u00fee\nwerld wroght hele in myddes of \u00fee erthe.\" And \u00feerfore \u00feai \u00feat gase oute of oure cuntreez of \u00fee west toward\nIerusalem, als many iournez as \u00feai make to ga \u00feider vpward, als many iournez sall \u00feai make to ga in to \u00fee land of\nPrestre Iohn dounward fra Ierusalem. And so he may ga in to \u00fease iles enuirounand all \u00fee roundness of \u00fee erthe and of \u00fee see till he com euen vnder vs. And \u00feerfore I hafe oft tymes thoght on a tale \u00feat I herd, when I was\n&yogh;ung, how a worthy man of oure cuntree went on a tyme for to see \u00fee werld; and he passed Inde and many iles\nby&yogh;onde Inde, whare er ma \u00fean v m iles, and he went so lang by land and by see, envirounand \u00fee werld, \u00feat he\nfand ane ile, whare he herd men speke his awen langage. For he herd ane dryfe bestez sayand to \u00feam swilke\nwordes as he herd men say til oxen in his awen cuntree gangand at \u00fee plugh; of whilk he had grete meruaile,\nfor he wist no&yogh;t how it myght be. Bot I suppose he had so lang went on land and on see, envirounand \u00fee\n\n \nwerld, \u00feat he was commen in to his awen marchez; and, if he had passed for\u00feermare, he schuld hafe commen\neuen to his awen cuntree. Bot for he herd \u00feat meruaile and myght get schipping na ferrere, he turned agayne as\nhe come; and so he had a grete trauaile. and so he loste moche peynefull labour, as him self seyde a gret while after \u00feat he was comen hom, C . And it befell efterward \u00feat he went in to Norway; and a tempest of\nwynd in \u00fee see drafe him, so \u00feat he arryued in ane ile. And, when he was \u00feare, he wist wele it was \u00fee ile in\nwhilk he had bene before and herd his awen speche, as men drafe bestez. And \u00feat myght right wele be; \u00feof\nall it be \u00feat symple men of cunnyng trowe no&yogh;t \u00feat men may ga vnder \u00fee erthe bot if \u00feai fall vnto \u00fee firmament.\nFor as vs think \u00feat \u00fease men er vnder vs, so think \u00feaim \u00feat we er vnder \u00feaim. For, if a man myghte fall fra \u00fee erthe to \u00fee firmament, by mare skill \u00fee erthe and \u00fee see, \u00feat er so heuy, schuld fall vnto \u00fee firmament. Bot \u00feat\nmay no&yogh;t be, as Godd witnessez him self \u00feare he saise, Non timeas me, qui suspendi terram ex nichilo , Apparently a misquotation of Job xxvi. 7. \u00feat es to\nsay, \"Hafe na drede of me, \u00feat hynged \u00fee erthe of no&yogh;t.\" And, if all it be possible \u00feat a man may ga all aboute \u00fee erthe, neuer\u00feeless of a thowsand perauenture ane\nschuld no&yogh;t do it in all his lyf, for to take \u00fee ri&yogh;t way all aboute \u00fee erthe til he come till his awen cuntree\nagayne \u00feat he come fra. For \u00feer er so many wayes and cuntreez \u00feat a man schuld lightly faile, bot if it ware by\nspecial grace of Godd. For \u00fee erthe is ri&yogh;t grete and large, and it contenes in roundeness aboute, abouen and\nbynethe xx m iiii c and xxv. myle, after \u00fee opinioun of alde wyse men \u00feat saise it, whilke I will no&yogh;t reproue. Bot\nafter my feble witte me thinke, saue \u00feaire grace, \u00feat it es mykill mare aboute. And for to make &yogh;ow to\nvnderstand how, I ymagyne a figure of a grete compas; and aboute \u00fee poynt of \u00feat compas, whilke es called\n\u00fee centre, be ano\u00feer lytill compas departed by lynes in many parties and \u00feat all \u00fease lynes mete sammen on \u00fee\ncentre, so \u00feat als many parties or lynes as \u00fee grete compas hase be on \u00fee lytill compas, if all \u00fee space be less.\nNow be \u00fee grete compas sette for \u00fee firmament, \u00fee whilk by astronomyeres es diuided in twelfe signez, and ilke\na signe es diuided in xxx. degreez; \u00feis es ccc. and lx. degreez \u00feat it es aboute. Now be \u00fee less compas sett for \u00fee erthe and departid in als many parties as \u00fee firmament, and ilkane of \u00fease parties answere to a degree of\n\u00fee firmament; \u00feise er in all dcc. and xx. and wyteth it wel \u00feat after the auctoures of astronomye dc. furlonges of erthe answeren to a degree of the firmament and \u00feo ben iiii xx vii. miles and iiii. furlonges, C . Now be \u00feise all multiplied ccc. tymes and lx. and it schall amount\n\n \nin all til xxxi m myle and fyue, ilke a myle of viii. furlangs, as myles er in oure cuntree. And so mykill hase \u00fee\nerthe in roundeness all aboute after myne opinioun and myne vnderstanding. And &yogh;e schall vnderstand after \u00fee\nopinioun of alde wise philosopheres and astronomyeres \u00feat Ingland, Scotland, Wales ne Ireland er no&yogh;t rekned\nin \u00fee height of \u00fee erthe, as it semez wele by all \u00fee bokes of astronomy. For \u00fee height of \u00fee erthe es departed in\nvii. parties, \u00fee whilk er called vii. climates after \u00fee vii. planetes, \u00feat er called climates; and til ilk ane of \u00fea\nplanets es approperd ane of \u00fee climatez. And \u00feise cuntreez \u00feat I spakk of er no&yogh;t in \u00fease climatez, for \u00feai er\ndounward toward \u00fee west.

Now will I turne\nagayne to my mater \u00feare I left, and tell &yogh;ow of ma cuntreez and iles, whilke er in Inde and be&yogh;ond.", "21": "CHAPTER XXI [Of the palays of the kyng of the yle of Jaua; of the trees that beren mele, hony, wyn and venym; and of othere meruaylles and customs vsed in the yles marchinge there abouten.] NERE \u00feis ile of Lamory whilke I spakk off es ano\u00feer ile, \u00feat men callez Somober. \u00deis es a grete ile and a gude, and a noble kyng \u00feerin and a myghty. \u00dee folk of \u00feis cuntree gers merk \u00feam in \u00fee visage\nwith a hate yrne for grete noblay, to be knawen fra o\u00feer folk; for \u00feai hald \u00feam selfe \u00fee maste wor\u00fei\nfolke of \u00fee werld.

And he held furth his hand to \u00fee kyng as he was dyand and blissed him with \u00fee takne of \u00fee Crosse, and bad \u00feat he schuld no&yogh;t drede him. And \u00fean alssone \u00fee kyng began to gader his spiritz agayne and answerd to sayne Thomas, \"Lord,\" quod he, \"now \u00feat I see \u00feis glorious takne of lyf with whilk \u00feou hase blissed me, I hafe na drede.

And it es called Tigris after a beste \u00feat has \u00fee same name, and it es \u00fee swiftest beste of\nfote of \u00fee werld. \u00deis riuer begynnez in Ermony \u00fee grete vnder \u00fee mounte of Parchoatra and rinnez so thurgh\nErmony and Asy toward \u00fee south, and so turnez in to \u00fee see Mediterrany. \u00dee ferthe riuer es called Eufrates,\n\u00feat es als mykill at say as Wele Berand; for \u00feare growez many gude thingez apon \u00feat riuer. \u00deat riuer rynnez\nthurgh Medy, Ermony and Perse.
