I. How Melusyne & her two sustirs shewid them to Raymondyn at the fontayne of Soyf or thurst /. DAuid the prophete saith, that the Iuggements and\nthe punysshinges of god ben as abysmes without\nbottom & without ryuage.  And he is not wyse that\nsuche thinges supposeth to comprehende in his wit / &\nweneth that the meruaylles that ben thrugh the\nvniuersal world, may nat be true, as it is said of the thinges\nthat men calle ffayrees / and as it is of many other\nthinges wherof we may not haue the knowleche of alle\nthem.  Now thenne the Creature ought nat therfore for\nto traueille, by outrageous presumyng to knowe & to\ncomprehende in his wit & vnderstanding the Iugements\nof god / but men oughten / thinkynge / to be meruaylled\nof hym / and meruaylling / to considere / how they may worthily & deuoutly prayse and glorify hym that Iugith\nso, and ordeynith suche thinges after hys plaisure &\nwille without eny gaynseyin&gtee;./ The creature of god that is raisonable, oughte moche\nbesily to vnderstande aftir the sayeng of Aristote,\nthat the \u00feynges which he hath made & creatid here\nbynethe, by the presence \u00feat they haue in themself,\ncertyfyen to be suche as they are / As saynct paule\nseyth in thepistle that he made to the Rommains /\nsayeng in this manere / that the thinges that he hath\ndoon, shalbe knowen & seen by the Creatures of the\nworld / that is to wete, by the men than can rede &\nadiousten feyth to \u00feactoures whiche haue ben byfore\nvs / as to wete & knowe the landes, the prouinces & the\nstraunge Countrees. and to haue ouerseen & vysyted\nthe dyuerse Royaumes / haue founde so many of dyuerse\nmeruaylles aftir common exstimacion, that thumayn\nvnderstanding is constrayned of god / that soo as he is\nwithout ryuage & without bottom / soo are the thinges\nmeruayllous & wounderfull in many dyuerse landes.\naftir their dyuerse nature / that saaf theire Iuggement.\nI suppose that neuer no man / but only Adam. hadd\nparfytt knowlege of the thinges Inuysible or that may\nnot be seen.  Wherfore I me bethink fro day to day\nto proufytte in science, & to here & see many thinges /\nwhich men suposen not to be true. the whic&hbar;, yf they\nbe trew / I putte them fourth into his termes byfore\nyou / to thende that the grette meruaylles that ben\nconteyned in this present hystory may be byleued.\nWherfore I think to treate to the playsure of god /\nand after the commandement of my said right mighty\nand noble lord./ LAte vs now leve the Auctoures with peas / and\nretourne we to that we haue herde say and telle\nof our auncyent and ol&dtail; tyme / and that this day we\nhaue her&dtail; sey what in the lan&dtail; of Poitow was seen in dede / for to couloure our hystory to be trew / as we\nhol&dtail; hit soo / and for to shew & publysshe it thrugh\nthe true Cronykles / as we suppose to doo /. We haue thenne her&dtail; say and telle of our auncyents,\nthat in many partes of the say&dtail; lande of Poytow haue\nben shewed vnto many oon right famylerly many\nmanyeres of thinges / the whiche somme called Gobelyns /\nthe other ffayrees, and the other 'bonnes dames' or good\nladyes / and they goo by nyght tyme and entre within\nthe houses without opnyng or brekyng of ony doore /\nand take & bere somtyme with them the children out of\ntheire cradelles. and somtyme they tourne them out of\ntheyre wit / and somtyme they brenne & roste them\nbefore \u00fee fyre / and whan they departe fro them, they\nleue hem as hoole as they were byfore / and somme gyue\ngrette happe & ffortune in this world.  And yet haue\nI her&dtail; say of oon Geruayse, a man worshipfu&llbar; & of\ncredence, that somme other fauntasyes appyeren by nyght\ntyme vnto many oon in dyuerse places, in lyknes of\nwymen with ol&dtail; face, of low and lytil stature or body /\nwhiche dide scoure pannes & potts, and dide suche\nthinges as a mayde or seruaunt oughte to doo / lyberaly\n& without dooyng of ony harme.  And also he saith\nfor certayn, that in his tyme he had&dtail; a fren&dtail; that was\nauncyent & ol&dtail;, whiche recounted for trouth / that in\nhys dayes he had&dtail; seen many tymes suche\nthinges. and saith yet the sai&dtail; Geruayse, that the sayd fayrees\ntoke somtyme the fourme & the fygure of fayre &\nyonge wymen / of whiche many men haue had&dtail; som\ndoughtirs, and haue take to theire wyues by meanes of\nsom couenauntes or promysses that they made them to\nswere vnto them / the som / that they shul&dtail; neuer see\neche other / on the satirday / and that by no maner\nwyse they shul&dtail; nat enquyre where they were\nbycomme / the other / that yf they had eny children / that theire husbandes shuld neuer see them in theyr\nchil&dtail; bed&dtail; / And as lon&gtee; as they kept theyre\ncovenauntes they had good fortune and were euer in\nprosperyte / but assoone as they faylled of theyr promysses\nor couenauntes they fell doun fro theyr good happ &\nfortune / and aftir these thinges so happed to haue\nbroken theyr couenauntes / the other were conuerted &\ntourned into serpentes.  And yet more sayth the said\nGeruayse, that he byleueth this to be permytted & doon\nfor som mysdedes that were doon ayenst the playsure\nof god / wherfore he punysshed them so secretly & so\nwounderly wherof none hath parfytte knowlege / but\nalonely he / and they may be therefore called the\nsecrets of god, abysmes without ryuage and without\nbottom / For none knoweth nothing perfyttly to the\nregarde of hym / how be it that sometyme of his\nprouysion ben many thinges knowen / not only of oon /\nbut of many other.  It is seen often whan a man\nhath yssued out of hys countree / and hath seen many\nawounder & meruayllous thynges whiche he neuer wold\nhaue byleued hit by here sayen&gtee;, without he had hadd\nthe sight of hit / but as for me that haue nat walked\nferre, I haue seen somme thinges that many oon shuld\nnat byleue without they sawe it.  With this seyth\nthe said Geruayse, & setteth fourth an ensaumple of a\nknyght, named Sir Robert du Chastel Roussel of the\nprouince of Asy / the whiche knight by auenture on an\neuen founde oon of the fayree in a medowe / and wold\nhaue had her to his wyf / and in dede she assentid to\nhit / by suche couenaunce that neuer he shuld see her\nnaked / and were longe togider / and the knight grew\n& wexed prosperous fro day to day.  It happed long\ntyme after that / that he wold haue seen the said\nNymphe naked / as he dede / in so moche that the\nsaid nymphe putte her heed in to a watre and was tourned in to a serpent, whiche was neuer seen after\nthat / And the knyght fro day to day wexed pouere\nand declyned from his prosperyte.  As for prouerbes\n& exemples I wil none bryn&gtee; more vnto you / and\nthat / that I haue doon / it was bycause \u00feat I suppose\nto treate how the noble ffortresse or Castell of\nLusygnen was bylded & made of a woman of the fayree, and\nthe manyere how / after the juste & true cronykle /\nwithout to applye ne adiouste to it nonething / but that\nit be approuued Iuste & trew, and of the propre or owne\nmatere / And ye shall here me spek & say of the noble\nlynee whiche yssued of the said woman / that shall\nregne for euer vnto thend of the world / aftir that it\nappiereth that it hath euer regned vnto this tyme\npresent.  But bycause that I byganne first to treate of\nthe fayree / I shall telle you how & of whens cam\nthe said woman whiche bilded the noble ffortress of\nLusygnen, beforsayd./ Herafter folowen the names of the estates of the\nchildren whiche yssued of Melusyne, and were\nbygoten of Raymondyn in wedlok.  And first yssued\nkyng Uryan, whiche regned in Cypre.  Aftir hym\ncam King Guyon, which regned myghtily in\nArmenye.  Item, Kin&gtee; Regnald, whiche regned right mightily\nin Behaygne.  Item, Anthony that was duc of\nLucembourgh.  Item, Raymond that was Erle of\nfforest.  Item, Geffray with the grette toth, that was lord of\nLusygnen.  Item, there yssued also theodoryk, which\nwas lord of Partenay.  Item, ffroymonde, that was\nmonke into thabbey of Mailleses, the whiche Geffray\nwith the grette toth brent the said Abbey, & thabbot\nalso with an hundred religyous or monkes./ It is true that there was somtyme in Albany a\nkynge that was moche worthy & valyaunt / And\nas sayth thystory / he had of hys wyf many children/ & that Mathas whiche was fader to fflorymond was\nhys first sone / and this kinge had to name Elynas,\nand was right worthy & mighty knight of his land./\nAnd it happed that after the decess of his first wyf / as\nhe chaced in a fforest nighe to the see, in the which\nforest was a moche fayre fontaynne / that sodaynly he\nhad so grett athurst / that as constreyned he tourned\n& yede toward the said fontaynne.  And whan he\napprouched to the said fontayne / he herde a voyce that\nson&gtee; so melodyously & so swetly / that he suposed none\nother / but it had the voyce of an Angel / but soone aftir\nhe knewe that hit was the voyce of a woman.  Thenne\ndescendid he & alyghted fro hys hors to thende he\nshulde not make gret affray / and walked fayre & softly\ntoward the fontayn in the most couered wyse that he\ncoude.  And whan he camme nygh to the fontayne /\nhe sawe there the fayrest lady that euer he the dayes\nof hys lyf had seen to his aduys or semynge.  Thenne\nhe stode styl al abasshed of the grett beaulte that he\nperceyued in the same ladye, whic&hbar; euer songe so\nmelodyously and so swetly.  And thus he stood styl /\nasmoche for the bewte of the lady / as for to here her\nswette & playsaunt voyce / and hyd hym in the best\nwyse that he coude vnder the leevis of the trees / to thende that the said lady shuld not perceyue hym / &\nforgate all the chasse and grett thurst that he had\nafore.  And byganne to think on the songe & on the beaulte\nof the lady.  In so moche that he was as rauysshed\n& knew nat yf it was daylight or nyght, ne yf he slept\nor wakke&dtail;./ Thus as ye shall now here was kynge helynas so\nabused / aswel of the right swete songe / as of\nthe bewte of the said lady that he ne wyst whether he\nslept or waked, For euer styl she songe so melodyously\nthat it was a swete & melodyous thing to here / Thenne the kynge Elynas was so rauysshed & abused that he\nremembred  of nothinge  worldly / but alonely that he\nher&dtail; & sawe the said lady, and abode there long tyme.\nThanne camme rannyng toward him two of hys houndis\nwhiche made to hym grett feste, and he lept & mevyd\nhym as a man wakynge from slep / and thenne he\nremembred of the chasse, and had of new so grett\nathurst / that without hauyng aduys ne mesure he yede\nfourth vpon the ryuage of the fountaynne, and toke the\nbasyn which hen&gtee; therby & drank of the watre.  And\nthenne he beheld the said lady whiche had lefte her\nsonge & salued her right humbly / beryng vnto her\nthe gretest honour & reuerence that he might.  Thanne\nshe that coude & wyst moche of wele & of honour,\nrendred to hym his salutacion right gracyously,\n'Lady,' said Elynas, the kinge / 'of your curtoysye be\nnat you dyspleased yf I requyre of you to knowe of\nyour estate / of your beyng & what ye are / For the\ncause that moueth me therto is suche / as now I shall\nreherse to you.  Right dere lady vouche ye saaf to\nwete & knowe that I can & know so moche of the\nbeyng of this countree, that there nys within this\nfoure or fyue myle neyther Castel ne ffortres, but \u00feat\nI knowe / except that same fro whens I departed this\nday by the mornyn&gtee;, whiche is two myle hens or\ntheraboute.  Nor there nys neyther lord ne lady within\nthis Countrey but that I knowe them wel, and therfore\ngretly I meruaylle & wounderly am abasshed, fro whens\nmay be suche a fayr and so gent a lady as ye be / so\nexempt & vnpurveyed of felawship.  and for godis loue\npardonne me / For grette outrage is to me to demande\nof you therof / but the grette desire & good wylle that\nmy herte bereth toward your gracyous personne, hath\ncaused hardynes within me for to doo it.'/ 'Sire Knight,' said the lady / 'there is none outrage /\nbut it commeth to you of grette curtoysye &\nhonour.  And knowe you, sire knight, that I shall nat\nbe longe alone whan it shal playse me / but from me\nI haue sent my seruaunts, while \u00feat I dysported me.'\nThenne cam fourth to that wor&dtail; oon of her seruaunts,\nwel arayed, whiche rode on a fayre Courcer, and att his\nright hand led&dtail; a palfroy so richely enharnashed that\nthe kyng Elynas was moche abasshed of the grette\nrichesse & noble aray that was about the said palfray.\nThanne said the seruaunt to his lady: 'Madame, it is\ntyme whan it shall playse you to comme.'  And she\nfourthwith said to the kinge:  'Sire knight, god be\nwith you, and gramercy of your curtoisye.' thenne she\nwent toward the palfray / and the kinge hyed hym,\n& helped to sette her on horsbak moche prately.\nAnd she thanked hym moche of hit, and departid /.\nAnd the kyng yede to his hors, and lept on his bake.\nthanne camme hys meney, whiche sought hym, and\nsayd that they had taken the herte.  And the kin&gtee;\nsaid to them / 'that playseth me.'  Thenne he byganne\nto thinke on the beaulte of the said lady, and so moche\nhe was surprysed of her loue, that he ne wyst what\ncontenaunce or manyere he shuld hold / and said to\nhis meyne / 'goo you alle before / and I shall folow\nyou soone.'  They yede at hys commandement theire\nway / and wel they perceyued & knew that he had&dtail;\nfound som thinge / And the king hastly tourned his\nhors, & toke the way that the said lady had ytaken / &\nfolowed her. Thystory recounteth to vs, that so long folowed the\nkinge Elynas the lady, that he found her in a\nfforest, where as were many trees high & strayt / and\n[it] was in the season that the tyme is swete & gracyous, & the place within the forest was moche\ndelectable.  And whan the lady herde the noyse\nof the hors of the kynge Elynas, that rode fast, she\nsaid to her seruaunt: 'Stand we styl, and late vs\nabyde this knight, For I byleue that he cometh vnto\nvs for to telle to vs a part of his wille, wherof he was\nnat as tofore aduysed, For we sawe hym lepe on his\nhors all thoughtfu&llbar;.'  'Madame,' said the seruaunt /\n'at your plaisure.'  Thanne camme the kinge nigh vnto\nthe lady / and as he had neuer seen her before, he\nsalewed her, moche affrayenge, For he was so\nsurprysed of her loue that he coude nat holde\ncontenaunce.  Thanne the lady, that knew ynoughe as it\nwas, and that she shuld comme to her entrepryse /\nsaid to hym: 'Kynge Elynas, what goost thou sechyn&gtee;\naftir so hastly / haue I oughte borne away of thyn\nowne?' / And whan the kin&gtee; herde hym named, he\nwas moche abasshed, For he knew nat what she was\nthat spak with hym / and neuertheles he ansuerde to\nher: 'My dere lady, nought of myn owne ye withbere /\nbut only that ye passe & goo thrugh my land / and it\nis grett shame to me / sith that ye be astraunger, that\nI ne doo you to be conueyed worshipfully thrugh my\nland / whiche I wold moche gladly doo yf I were\nin place, & had tyme & space for to doo it.'  Thenne\nansuerde the lady:  'Kynge Elynas, I hold you for\nescused, & pray you yf ye wyl of vs none other thinge /\nthat ye leue ne lette nat your retourne for that cause.'\nAnd Elynas ansuerde / 'wel other thin&gtee; I seke,\nlady' / 'And what is it?' said she / 'telle it to me\nhardyly.'  'My right dere lady, sith that it is your\nwille & plaisir for to knowe it / I shall telle it to you.\nI desire moche more than eny other thin&gtee; in the\nworld forto haue your good loue & your good grace.'\n'By my feith,' said she, 'kyng Elynas, to that haue ye not faylled / yf that ye think theron but wele &\nhonour, For neuer man shal haue my loue in hys\nauauntynge.'  'Ha, my dere lady, I ne think on my\nlyf on none cas dyshoneste.' Thenne perceyued the\nlady \u00feat he was esprised of her loue, & said to hym /\n'yf ye wil take me as your wyf by mariage, and be\nsworne vnto me that ye shal nat see me duryng my\nchildbed, nor to peyne your self in no manere of way\nfor to loke on me att that tyme / And yf this ye wil\ndoo & swere / I am she that shal obey to you as a wyf\nought to obey her husband.'  Thanne \u00fee kinge anoone,\nand with good wille, sware & promysed to hold that\nbyfore is said.  Without longe rehercyng they were\nspoused, & led&dtail; longe a good lyf togidre.  But al the\nland of the kinge Elynas was moche abasshed who was\nthis lady / how be it that she gouerned her wel right\nwysly & valiauntly.  But Nathas, that was sone to the\nkynge Elynas, hated her ouermoche.  and [it] happed\nthat she was at her childbed of thre doughtirs / the\nwhiche she had bornne ryght gracyously alle her tyme,\n& was deliuered of them thre at ende of ix. monethis /\nthe first borne was named Melusigne, the second\nMelyor, and the iijde.  Palatyne.  The kynge Elynas\nwas nat thanne present at that place, but kynge Nathas\nhis sone was there, and beheld hys thre sustirs, that\nwere so fayre that it was meruaylle.  and thanne he\nwent toward the kinge his fader / and thus he said to\nhym: 'Sire / Madame, the quene Pressyne your wyf,\nhath made & is delyuered of thre doughtirs, the most\nfayre that euer were seen / comme & see them.'  Thenne\nkinge Helynas, that remembred nat of the promysse\nthat he had made to Pressyne his wyf / sayd / 'ffayre\nsone / so wyl I doo.'  And yede apertly & entred\nanoon within the chambre wheras Pressyne bathed her\nthre doughtirs.  and whan he saw them / he said in this manere: 'god blesse the moder & the doughters,'\n& toke of them grette Ioye.  And whan pressyne\nherde hym, she answerde to hym, 'Fals kinge, thou\nhast faylled thy couenaunt, wherof grett euyl shal\ncomme vnto the / and hast lost me for euermore.\nAnd wel I wot that thy sone Nathas is cause therof,\n& departe I must fro the lightly.  but yet I shalbe\nauenged me on thy sone by my sustir & felow, my\nlady of the yle lost.'  And these thinges said / [she]\ntoke her thre doughtirs & had them withher / and\nneuer aftir she was seen in the land / Thystorye saith to vs, that whan the kinge had lost\npressyne his wyf, and his thre doughters, he was\nso wofu&llbar; & so abasshed that he wyst not what he\nshuld doo or say.  but he was by the space of seuen\nyere that he dede none other thinge, but compleyned\n& sighed, & made grette playntes & piteous\nlamentacions for loue of Pressyne his wyf, whiche he louyd of\nlawfull loue.  and the peuple in hys land said that he\nwas assoted.  and in dede they gaue & betoke the\ngouernement ouer them & of alle the lande to Nathas\nhis sone.  Which gouerned valiauntly, and held hys\nfader in grette charyte.  And thenne the barons of\nAlbanye gaf to hym vnto hys wyf agentyl woman,\nwhiche was lady of Ycrys.  And of these two yssued\nfflorymond, whiche afterward toke moche of peyne &\ntraueyll.  Neuertheles, oure hystory is not enterprysed\nne begonne for hym / and therfore we shall hold oure\npeas of hym, and we shall retourne to oure hystorye. Thistorye saith, that whan Pressyne departed &\nyede with her thre doughtirs, she went in to\nAualon, that was named the yle lost, bycause that a&llbar;\nhad a man ben there many tymes / yet shuld  not he\nconne retourne thither hymself alone / but byhapp & grett auenture.  And there she nourysshed her thre\ndoughtirs vnto the tyme that they were xv. yere of\nage / and led&dtail; them euery mornyng on a high\nmountaynne whiche was named, as thystory saith &\nrecounteth, Elyneos, whiche is asmoche for to say in\nenglissh as fflorysshed hy&llbar;.  For from thens she sawe\nynough the land of Albany.  and often said to her\nthre doughtirs, waymentyng & sore wepyng: 'See, my\nfayre doughters, yonder is the land wher ye were born /\nand ye shuld haue had your wele & honour, ne had be\nthe dommage of your fader, that bothe you & me hath\nputte in grett myserye without ende vnto the day of\ndome, whan god shal punysshe the euyl folk / and the\ngood he shall enhaunse in theire vertues.' Melusyne, tholdest doughtir, demanded of her\nmoder Pressyne: 'What falshed hath doon\noure fader, wherby we must endure so longe this greef\n& sorow?'  Thanne the lady, theyre moder, byganne\nto telle & shew vnto them all the manere of the\nfaytte, so as ye haue her&dtail; tofore.  And thenne whan\nMelusyne had herde her moder, and that she\nvnderstode all the faitte or dede, She tourned the talke of\nher moder, & demanded of her the commodytees of\nthe land / the name of the Cites, tounes, & Castels of\nAlbanye / and rehercyng these thinges they al descendid\ndoun fro the hy&llbar;, & retourned to the yle of Aualon.\nAnd thanne Melusyne had & drew apart her two\nsustirs, that is to wete Melyor & Palatyne, & said to\nthem in this manyere: 'My dere sustirs, now loke &\nbyhold we the myserye wherin oure fader hath putt\nboth oure moder & vs all, that shuld haue be so wel att\nease & in so grette worship in oure lyues.  what think\nyou good of your best aduys for to doo / For as for my parte I think to auenge me therof / and as lytel\nmyrthe & solas that he hath Impetred to oure moder\nby hys falshed / as lytel joye I think to purchasse\nvnto hym /.'  Thenne her two sustirs ansuerde to her\nin this manere: 'Ye be our oldest sustir, we shall\nfolowe & obey you in all that ye wil doo & shall\nordonne theirof.'  And Melusyne said to them / 'ye\nshew good loue, & to be good & lawfull to oure moder,\nFor by my feyth ye haue said right wel.  and I haue\naduysed yf it semeth you good that we shall close or\nshett hym on the high mountayne of Northomberland,\nnamed Brombelyoys / and in myserye he shalbe there all his lyf.'  'My sustir,' said either of bothe sustirs /\n'lette now hye vs for to doo this / For we haue\ngrette desyre to see that oure moder be auenged of\nthe vnlawfulnes that our fader dede shew vnto her.'\nThanne the thre doughtirs dide so moc&hbar;, that by\ntheyre false condycion they toke theyr fader, & closed\nor shett hym on the said mountayne.

Thanne camme ther\nPressyne his wyf and buryed hym there / and on hym\nmade to be sette oon so noble & so riche a tombe, \u00feat\nneuer byfore ne syn that tyme was seen none suche ne\nso riche.  For on the tombe were riches without\ncomparacion as of precyous stones and other Jewellis / and\nabout it were grett & highe Candelstykes of fyn gold,\nand lampes & torches whiche brennen both day &\nnyght continuelly.  And on the said tombe stood vp\nright a Statue or ymage of Alabaster, kerued & made\naftir the lengthe, lyknes, & fourme of Kinge Elynas /\nand the said ymage held in her handes a table of gold,\nwhereon was writon the forsaid auenture.  And there\nthe lady Pressyne stablysshed a stronge geaunt to the\nsauegarde of the tresoure byfore said / the whiche\nGeaunt was wounder fyers & horryble, and al the\nCountre therabout he held vnder his subgection.  And\nalso aftir hym many other geaunts kept it vnto the\ntyme & commyng of Geffray with the grett toth / of\nthe whiche ye shall more here herafter.  Now haue ye\nherde of the Kin&gtee; Elynas and of Pressyne his wyf.\nAnd from hens fourthon I wil bigynne & shew the\ntrouth of thystory of the meruaylles of the noble Castel\nof Lusignen in Poitow.  And why & by what manere\nhit was bilded & made./ Thystory recounteth to vs that there was somtyme\nin the Brut Brytayne a noble man whiche fell at\ndebate with the nevew of the kin&gtee; of Bretons.  and in\ndede he durst therfore nomore dwelle within the land /\nbut toke with hym al his fynaunce & goodes, and went\nout of the land by the high mountaynes.  And as\ntelleth thistorye he founde on a day highe by a\nfontayne a fayr lady to whom he told al his Fortune &\naduenture / so that fynally they enamoured eche other, and the lady shewed to hym grett loue, & dide vnto\nhym moc&hbar; comfort.  and he began within her land,\nthat was wast & deserte for to byl&dtail; & make fayre\ntounes & strong Castels.  and was the land within short tyme peupled raisonably / And they dede calle\nthe land forestz, bycause that they founde it full of\ngrett wodes & thikk bushes, And yet at this day it is\ncalled Forestz.  It haped that this knight & this lady\nfel at debate togidre.  I ne wot not goodly how ne\nwherfore / but that right sodaynly departed the lady\nfro the knight, wherefore he was woful & heuy.  and\nnotwithstandinge he grew & encreaced euer in worship\nand in prosperite.  The noble men thanne of this land /\nseeyng that they were without a lady purveyed hym of\noon to hys wyf, a moche gentil & fayre woman, sustir\nto the Erle of Poiters, whic&hbar; regned at that tyme, &\nhe begate on her many children males.  emonge the\nwhiche was oon / that is to wete the iijde borne,\nwhiche was named Raymondyn, and was fayre, goodly\n& gracyous, moche subtyl & wyty in all thinges.  And\nthat same tyme the said Raymondin might be xiiij\nyere of age. /", "2": "Cap. II. How the Erle of Poytiers prayde the Erle of Forests for to comme to the Feste that he made of hys sone. / The Erle of Poyters held a grett feste of a sone\nthat he had, and wold haue made hym to be\ndowbed a knight.  And no more children he had, but\nonly a fayre mayde that was called Blanche / and the\nsone had to name Bertrand. Thanne the Erle Emery manded & desyred a moc&hbar; fayre company for loue of\nthe knighthode of his sone / and amonges other he bode & prayed the Erle of Forests to comme to the feste,\n& that he shuld brin&gtee; with him thre of his sones, the\noldest, For he wold see them.  Thanne the Erle of\nForestz went at his mandement in the moost\nhonourable wyse that he coude, and with hym he led thre of\nhis sones.

'Now byleue thou it surely,'\nsaid the Erle to Raymondyn, 'For it is as I te&llbar; to the.'\n'By my feith,' said Raymondin / 'yet shall I nat\nbyleue it.'

And the Erle, that knew & wyst \nmoche of the chasse, broched the bore thrughe the brest / \nbut the Erle fe&llbar; doun on his knees.  And thanne Raymondyn, \nholdyng hys swerde in his hand, camme toward the bore, and \nwold haue smytte hym betwene the foure legges, For he leye \nvpsodounne the bely vpward.  and suche a stroke gaaf Raymondyn \nto the bore, that the blade of hys swerde brake / so that the poynte of \nit spran&gtee; ayenst the Erlis stomak, & wounded hym sore / in so \nmoche that he deyed therof.

And she, as angry & wroth, sayd ones ayen to hym: 'And how, sire musarde, are ye so dyspytous that ye dayne nat ansuere to me?' And yet he ansuered neuer a wor&dtail;.  'By my feith,' sayd she within her self, 'I byleue nonne other / but that this yong man slepeth vpon his hors / or ellis he is eyther dombe or def / but as I trow I shal make hym wel to spek, yf he euer spak byfore.'  And thenne she toke and pulled strongly hys hand, sayeng in this manere: 'Sire vassal, ye slep.'  Thanne Raymondyn was astonyed and affrayed, as one is whan another awaketh hym fro slepe / and toke hys swer&dtail;, wenyng to hym that it had be hys vnclis meyne, that wold haue take and slayn hym.  And the lady thanne perceyued wel that he yet had not seen her, and, al lawghing, bygan to say to hym, 'Sire vassal, with whom wyl you bigynne the bataille? / your enemys ben not here, And knowe you, fayre sire, that I am of your party or syde?'  And whan Raymondyn herd her spek, he beheld her, and perceyued the gret beaulte that was in her, and toke of hit grett meruay&llbar;, For it semed to hym that neuer byfore he had not seen none so fayre.  And thenne Raymondyn descendid from hys hors, and bowed hys knees, and made reuerence vnto her, and said: 'My dere lady, pardonne to me myn Ignoraunce & vylonny that I haue doo toward you, For certyanly I have mystaken ouermoche anenst your noble personne.  And neuertheles, I ne sawe ne herd neuer what ye haue said tyl that ye toke me by the hand.  and knowe ye, that I thoughte moche at that tyme on a thinge that sore lyeth nygh to my herte / and vnto god I pray deuoutly that amendes I may make vnto you / and that of hys grace I may at myn honour be out of this peyne, whiche hurteth myn herte sore.'  'By my feyth,' sayd the lady / 'it is wel said, For as for to bygynne eny thinge, the name of god most first be called to mans help / and I byleue you wel / that\nye herd not what I haue said / but, fayre sire, whither\ngoo you att this tyme of nyght / telle hit hardyly\nto me / yf goodly ye may dyscouere it.  And yf you\nknowe not the way / wel I sha&llbar; dresse you to it / For\nthere nys neyther way ne pat&hbar; but that I knowe it\nwel, and therof ye may trust on me hardyly.'  'By\nmy feith,' said Raymondyn, 'gramercy, lady, of\nyour curtoysye.  And ye shal knowe it, my dere lady,\nsith that youre desyre is for to know it, I haue lost the\nhigh way syn almost yestirday none vnto now / and\nI ne wot where I am.'  Thanne perceyued she that he kept hys faytte secret fro her / and said to hym:\n'By god, fayre frend Raymondyn, ye shuld not hyde\nnothinge fro me, For I wot wel how it standeth with\nyou.'  And thenne whan Raymondyn her&dtail; that she\nnamed hym by hys owne name, he was so abasshed\nthat he wyst not what he shuld ansuere.  And she \u00feat\nsawe wel that he was shamfu&llbar; of that she had named\nhym, and that she wyst so moche of hys secret &\nCounsey&llbar;, sayd to hym in this manere: 'Forsouthe,\nRaymondyn, I am she after god that may best\ncounseylle the / and that may furthre and enhaunse the in\nthis mortal lyf.  and all thin aduersytees & mysdedes\nmost be tourned in to wele / nought auaylleth to the\nfor to hyde them from me.  For wel I wot that thou\nhast slayn thy lord / as moche by myshap / as\nwylfully / how be it that at that ooure thou supposest not\nto haue doon it.  and I wot wel all the wordes that he\ntold vnto \u00fee of the arte Astronomye, wherin duryng\nhys lyf he was right expert.'  Whan Raymondyn\nherde this he was more abasshed than he was tofore /\nand said to the lady: 'Right dere lady, ye telle to me\nthe trouth of alle thinges that ye say; but moche I\nmeruaylle me how ye may so certaynly knowe it / and who told it so soone to you?'  And she ansuerd to\nhym in this manere: 'Be not thou abasshed therof,\nFor I knowe the full trouth of thy faytte.  And wene\nnor suppose thou nat that it be fauntesye or dyuels\nwerk of me and of my wordes, For I certyfye the,\nRaymondyn, that I am of god, and my byleue is / as\na Catholique byleue oughte for to be.  and I lete the\nto wete that without me and my counseyll / thou\nmayst not comme to thende of thy faytte.  but yf thou\nwilt byleue stedfastly all that thyn vncle Emerye said\nvnto the, hit shalbe profytable to the, with the help of\ngod and of me.  And I say so moche that I shal make\nthe for to be the gretest lord that euer was of thy\nlynage, and the gretest and best lyuelod man of them\na&llbar;.'  Whan Raymondyn vndersto&dtail; the promysse of\nthe lady / he remembred the wordes that hys lord\ntold vnto hym.  And consyderyng within hym self the\ngrete parels wherin he was as exilled and banysshed\nout of hys Countre & fro his frendes, said [to\nhymself] that he shuld take thauenture for to byleue the\nlady of all that she shuld doo or say to hym, For but\nones as he said he shuld passe the cruell paas of the\ndeth.  And to the lady he ansuerde full humbly in\nthis manere: 'My right dere lady, I thanke you moche\nof the promysse that ye do and proffre to me.  For ye\nshall see & knowe that this shal not abyde or tarye by\nme for no traueyll that ye can aduyse / but that I\nshall euer doo your playsire, yf it be possible to be\ndoo / and that a cristen man may, or ought to doo,\nwith honour.'  'By my feyth, Raymondin,' said the\nlady / 'that is said of free herte, For I shall not say\nnor counseille you nothing / but that good & wele shal\ncomme therof.  but first of alle,' said she / 'ye most\npromyse to me that ye shall take me to your wyf.  and make you no doubte of me / but that I am of god.  And thanne Raymondyn yede & ganne say, & sware in this manere, 'Lady dere / by my feith / sith that ye ensure me that it is soo / I shal doo aftir my power all that ye wyl commaunde me for to doo / And indide I lawfully promytte you that so shal I doo.'  'Yet Raymondyn,' sayd she, 'ye most swere another thinge.'  'What it is, my lady,' said Raymondyn, 'I am redy / yf it be thinge that goodly I may doo.'  'ye,' said she / 'and it may not tourne to you to no dommage / but to all wele.  Ye muste promytte to me, Raymondyn, vpon all the sacrements & othes that a man very catholoque & of good feith may doo and swere, that neuer while I shalbe in your company, ye shal not peyne ne force your self for to see me on the Satirday / nor by no manere ye shal not enquyre that day of me, ne the place wher I shalbe.'  And whan she had thus said to Raymondyn, he yet ageyn said to her in this manere: 'On the parel of my sowle I swere to you / that neuer on \u00feat day I ne shal doo nothing that may hyndre ne adommage you in no manere of wyse' / 'and I,' said she, 'ne shal doo nor thinke to none other thin&gtee; but in what manere I shall mowe best encresse in worship and honour, both you and your lynee.'  And Raymondyn yede & gan sey to her in this manere, 'Soo shal I doo it to the playsire of god.'/ 'THanne,' said the lady / 'I shal now telle how ye most doo / doubte you not of nothin&gtee;.  but goo fourthwith vnto Poyters, And whan ye shal comme there / many one ye shal fynd commyng fro the chasse that shall axe to you tydynges of the Erle, your vncle.  and to them ye shall ansuere in this manere / \"how / is he not yet comme ayen?\"  And they shal sey \"nay.\"  and thanne ye shal say, \"I neuer sawe hym syn that the chasse was at the strengest, and whan ye lost\nhym\" / and semblaunt ye most mak to be abasshed\nmore than eny other.  And soone after shul comme the\nhunters and other of hys meyne, and shal brynge with\nthem the corps deed within a litere / & his woundes\nshal seme to euery man aduys to be made by the\nwildbores teth.  and they shal say alle, that the wildbore\nhath slayn hym, And yet they shall say that the Erle\nkyled the sayd bore / and many one shal hold it for a\nhardy & valiaunt dede.  thus the dolour & woo shal\nbygynne to be moche grete.  The Erle Bertrand, his\nsone, & hys doughtir Blanche, & alle o\u00feer of hys\nmeyne, bothe lesse & grete togidre, shal make grete\nsorowe / and so shall ye doo with them.  and ye shall\nputte on you the blak gowne as they shall.  And aftir\nthis nobly doon, and the terme assigned & take whan\nthe barons shall comme for to doo theire obeysaunce &\nhomage vnto the yon&gtee; Erle, ye shal retourne hither to\nme the day byfore the lordes & barons make theire\nhomage / and that tyme att this same place ye sha&llbar;\nfynde me.'   Thanne as Raymondyn wold haue departed\nfrom Melusyne to haue take hys leve of her / she said\nto hym in this manere: \"Hold, my redoubted fren&dtail; /\nfor to bygynne & assemble our loue, I gyue you these\ntwo rynges, of whiche the stones ben of grette vertue.\nFor the one hath suche appropriet\u00e9, that he to whomme\nhit shal be gyuen by paramours or loue, shal not dey\nby no stroke of no manere of wepen, ne by none\narmes / as longe as he shal bere it on hym / And the\nother is of suche vertue, that he that bereth it on hym\nshal haue victory of all his euyl willers or enemyes / al\nbe it pletyng in Courtes, or fyghtyn&gtee; in feldes, or ellis\nwhersoeuer it be: and thus, my fren&dtail;, ye may goo\nsurely.'  Thanne toke Raymondin leue of the lady,\nand embraced & kyssed her swetly & moc&hbar; frendly as she on whom all hys hoop was leyd.  For he was\nas thenne so moche esprised of her loue / that al that\nshe sayd / doubtles he held it for trouth.  and raison\nit was, as ye shall here herafter in thystorye./", "7": "Cap. VII. How Raymondin, by the counseyl of the lady, went to Poytiers. RAymondyn lepte vpon his hors, and the lady\ndressed and putte hym in to the high way of\nPoytiers, and [he] departed fro the lady.  And at\ndepartyng Raymondyn was ful sory, For he loued\nalredy so moche her felawship, that wel wold euer\nhaue be with her.  Thenne thinkynge, he byganne\nfast to ryde toward the Cite of Poyters.  And the\nsaid lady retourned toward the said Fontaynne, where\nthe two other ladyes were, & abode her there / of\nwhic&hbar; ladyes thystory leueth here to speke/. NOw saith thystorye, that Raymondyn rode so fast\nthat soone he was comme into Poytiers, where\nhe founde many one that were retourned fro the\nchasse, whic&hbar; demanded of hym, 'where is my lord?'\n'how,' said thanne Raymondyn / 'is he not comme?' /\nand they ansuer&dtail; 'nay.'  And he said to them, 'I\nsawe hym neuer syn that the grete chasse bygan, and\nthat the bore scaped fro the houndes.'  And while that\nthey spak of this matere amon&gtee; them alle / the hunters\n& other folk arryued there fro the chasse, som now\nand thenne, the whiche all said as Raymondyn had\nsayd.  And som said that neuer they had seen suche\n& so meruayllous a chasse, ne so horryble a bore.  And\nmany one said that the bore was comme fro somme other\nland, For none so grete / nor that ranne so fast sawe\nthey neuer.  Thanne was euery man meruaylled / how the Erle taryed so longe.  and they went to the yate\nfor to see if he camme, & abode hym \u00feer a longe space.\nand euer camme folk that said as the other had sayd /\nand that they lay all that nyght in the sayd Forest, For\nthey had lost theyre way.  Thanne was all the peuple\nof Poyters woofu&llbar; & heuy for loue of theyr lord, that\ntaryed so longe / and specyally the Countesse, the said\nErlis wyf.  but more woofull & heuyer they were\nwithin a lytel while after/.", "8": "Cap. VIII. How the Erle Emery was brought vnto Poytiers deed within a Lyttere. THystorye telleth vnto vs, that so lon&gtee; they abode\nat the gate with Raymondyn, that they sawe\ncommynge toward the Cite a grete multitude of peuple.\nand as they dide approuc&hbar; & camme nyg&hbar;, they her&dtail;\nand vndersto&dtail; the piteous voyces of them, wherof they\nwere all meruaylled / and bygan many one to doubte\nlest that they shuld haue hadd som trouble or somme\nempeschement.  And so longe they abo&dtail;, that they\nwhiche bare the corps of theire lord camme vnto them,\nsore lamentyn&gtee; & piteously waylyn&gtee;, sayen&gtee; to them\nin this manere: 'wepe ye, and wepe ayen, & clothe\nyou a&llbar; in blak, For the bore hath slayn our good lord,\nthe Erle Emerye.'  And after the corps camme two\nhunters, that bare grette bore.  and thus they\nentred into the Cite, makyn&gtee; grete sorowe.  And alle\nthe peuple of the Cite, seeyng theyre lord deed,\nbyganne pyteously to crye / sayeng in this manere: 'Ha/\nha, cursed be he of god that first anounced this chasse.'\nThe sorrow & dolour was there so grete that no man sawe neuer no greter.  And making suche sorowe camme\nvnto the Palleys / and there was the Corps leyed.  And\nbycause one oughte not to kepe ne mayntenne longe sorowe, I passe it ouer lyghtly.  The Countesse & her\nchildren made ouergrete sorow / and so dide the Barons\nand a&llbar; the Comynaltee of the land.  And knowe ye\nalso / that so dide Raymondyn, as it foloweth./ Raymondyn made grete sorowe and greter than eny\nother, and sore repented hym of hys mysdede,\nAnd so moche / that yf it had not be the hoop &\ncomfort of his lady, he had not mowe withold hym self,\nbut \u00feat he had sayd vnto them al hys auenture, for\ncause of the grete contricion that he had of the deth of\nhys vncle and lord.  But I will not spek long of this\nmatere.  Soone thobsequye was doon moche nobly &\nrichely within the Chirche of our lady of Poytiers,\nafter the custome that was at that tyme, And ye muste\nknowe that the good folk of the land that had lost \u00feeir\nlord were full of heuynes and of sorow / and they\nfourthwith toke the said bore, and byfore the said\nChirch of our lady they brent it / And as it is wel\ntrouth that there nys so grete a sorowe, but that within\nfoure dayes it is somwhat peased / the barons of the\nland thanne yede and swetly comforted the Countesse\nand her two children aftir theire power / and so moche\nthey dide that her grete sorowe was somwhat peased.\nBut \u00fee sorowe of Raymondyn grew & wexed more and\nmore, as wel bycause of his grete mysdede / as for the\ngrete loue of whiche he loued hys vncle.  It was thanne\nordeyned & concluded by the Counsey&llbar; that alle the\nBarons of the land shuld be sente fore, & boden to\ncomme at a certayn day for to doo theire homage to\ntheyre gracyous lord, the sone of the said late Erle.\nAnd assone as Raymondyn knew of it, he toke hys hors\nand alone yssued out of Poytiers and entred within the\nForest, for to goo & hold hys couenaunt vnto his lady./", "9": "Cap. IX. How Raymondyn retourned toward hys lady, and sawe a Chapell whiche neuer he had seen before./ THystory telleth to vs that so longe rode\nRaymondyn that he camme into the Forest of\nCoulombyers, & passed thrug&hbar; the lytel toune, & went vpon\nthe mountayne and yede so longe that he perceyued\nthe medowes whiche were vnder the roche, that was\naboue the Fontayne of Soyf, and sawe a hous made of\nstone in a manere of a Chape&llbar;.  And knowe ye that\nRaymondyn had be there many [a] tyme, but neuer tofore\nhe had seen it / and went neuer to hit; And before the\nplace he perceyued many ladyes, knyghtes, & Squyers\nwhiche made to hym grete feste and praysed hym\ngretly.  Wherfor he meruaylled gretly, For one of them\nsaid to hymme: 'Sire, alight & come toward my lady\nthat abydeth aftir you within her pauyllon or tente.'\n'By my feyth,' sayd Raymondyn / 'hit plaiseth me wel\nso for to doo.'  Soone he descendid from hys hors &\nyede with them, whic&hbar; conueyed hym toward the lady\nmoche honourably.  And thanne the lady camme to\nmete hym, & toke hym by the hand and ledd hym\ninto her tente, And satte both vpon a bed of parement\nmoche ryche / and all the other abode without.  Thanne\nbyganne the lady for to raisonne with Raymondyn, &\nsaid to hym in this manere: 'My dere frende, wel I\nwote that wel ye haue hold alle that I introduysed, or\ntaught you of, And therfore fro hens fourthon I shall\ntrust you the more.'  'Lady dere,' sayd Raymondyn /\n'I haue founde so good a bygynnyn&gtee; in your wordes,\nthat nothing ye shall commande to me that humayn\nbody may or oughte to comprehende or vndertake /\nbut that I wyl & shal doo it after your playsire.'\n'Raymondyn,' said she / 'for me ye shall vndertake no thin&gtee;, but that of it ye shal comme to your\nworship /.'  Thenne camme there a knyght whiche kneled\nbefore her / and after his reuerence made / dressed hys\nwordes toward her, & said: 'My lady, al thin&gtee; is\nredy / ye shal comme whan it playse you.'  And the\nlady ansuerde & said / 'Couere your heed, fayre\nsire.'  Thanne the lady & Raymondyn wesshe theire handes\n& sette them at a moche ryche table.  and within the\nsayd pauyllon were many other tables dressed, where\ndide sette many knightes and ladyes / and whan\nRaymondyn saw this appareyll, he meruaylled moche / and\ndemanded of hys lady fro whens so grete a felawship\nwas comme vnto her.  And to hys demande the lady\nansuer&dtail; nothin&gtee;.  Wherfore Raymondyn asked of her ayen,\n'My lady, fro whens are comme vnto you so many\nof gentyl men and ladyes?'  'By my feyth, Raymondyn,\nmy fren&dtail;,' say&dtail; the lady, 'it is no nede to you for to\nbe meruaylled therof, For they be all at your\ncommandement, & redy for to serue you / & many other\nalso that now ye see not.'  Thanne held Raymondyn\nhys peas / and so many courses & of dyuerse metes\nwere before them brought, that meruayll it was to see\nit.  And whan they had dyned, they weshe theire\nhandes / and graces said & all thinges doon / the lady\ntoke Raymondyn by the hand & ledd hym beside the\nbeed, & euerychon voyded the pauyllon, and wheras\nthey lyst went, or wher they oughten for to haue goo,\neche one aftir theyre estate /. THannne said the lady to Raymondyn: 'My fren&dtail;,\nto morowe is the day that the barons shal comme\nfor to doo theire homage vnto the yong Erle\nBertrand.  And know you, my frend, that there must ye be / &\nshal doo as I shal telle you, yf it playse you so to doo /\nNow vnderstand & reteyne wel my wordes.

And\ntelle to hym wel, how that ye ne demande of hym\nnothre toune, ne Castel, nor other thing of no grete\nvalue.  and I wote wel that he shal acorde or graunt it\nto you.

X. How Raymondyn, after that the barons had doon theire homage vnto the yon&gtee; Erle / demanded of the Erle a yefte, the whiche he graunted to hym./ THystorye telleth to vs, that Raymondyn rode so\nlonge that he camme vnto Poytiers, wheras he\nfounde many a high baron, whic&hbar; were comme there for\nto make homage to the yon&gtee; Erle Bertrand / and they\ndyde grete honour and reuerence to Raymondyn, and\npreysed hym right moche.

Thenne cam the barons tofore hym /\nand there one after another, and eche one after hys\ndegre rendred to hym hys homage.  And thenne,\nafter alle these thinges were doon / Raymondin putte\nhymself fourth before the barons / and with meke &\nhumble contenaunce or manere, said to them: 'Emon&gtee; you, my lordes, nobles, Barons of the Countre or\nErledom of Poytwo, vouchesaf ye to here & knowe the\nrequeste whiche I wyl putte & make vnto my lord\nthe Erle.  and yf it seme you to be lawfull &\nraisonnable / I beseche that it playse you for to pray hym to\ngraunt it to me.'  And the Barons ansuerd with right\na good wi&llbar;, 'we shall doo it.'  Thanne they altogidre\nwent before the Erle, to whom Raymondyn spake\nfirst moche humbly, sayeng in this manere: 'Right\ndere sire, humbly I beseche and requere you, that in\nremuneracion, or reward, of alle the seruyses that ever\nI dide vnto my lord, your fader / on whos sowle god\nhaue mercy, ye vouchesaf of your benigne & noble\ngrace for to gyve to me a yefte, the whiche shall cost\nyou but lityl.  For knowe you, Sire, that I ne demande\nof you neyther tounne, Castel, nor fortresse, ne nothinge\nof grette valew.'  Thanne ansuerde the Erle, 'yf it\nplayseth to my barons / ful wel it playseth to\nme.'  And the Barons said to hym in this manere: 'Sire,\nsyn it is thyn&gtee; of so lytyl valewe, as he speketh of,\nye oughte not to refuse it to hym / For he is wel\nworthy therof, and wel he hath deserued it.'  And the\nErle said to them, 'Syn it pleseth to you for to\ncounseylle me soo / I graunt it' / 'demande now,' said the\nErles to Raymondyn, 'what ye wyl.'  'Sire,' said he,\n'gramercy.  Other yefte I ne axe of you, but \u00feat ye\nwyl gyue to me, about the fontaynne of soif that is\nnygh to the roches & wodes / as moche of grounde as the\nhyde or leder of a hert shall mow comprehende or goo\naboute, bothe of lengthe & brede.'  'Forsouthe,' said\n\u00feenne the Erle / 'this I ought not to refuse to\nyou.  I gyue it to you,' said the Erle, 'freely, without\nredeuaunce nor homage to be doon to me, nor to my\nsuccessours for euermore.'  Thenne Raymondyn kneled & thanked hym ryght humbly / and requyred of hym\nlettres of hys gyfte, the whic&hbar; were graunted & made\nin the best and moost surest wyse that could be\ndeuysed / and were Seelled of the grette Seal of the\nErle, by thassent and relacion of alle the Barons of\nthe land / whiche also dide putte theire Seelles\ntherto.  Thanne they departed fro the chirche of Saynt Hylary\nof Poytiers, and yede fourth vnto the halle, where the\nfeste was grete and joyous, and swete melody was there\nher&dtail; of almaner Instruments Musyque. and of many\n& dyuerse meets they were serued at the table.

And thus\npassed the day tyl the nyght camme that euerychon\nwent to take hys reste.  And on the mornne next they\nroos and yede for to here masse vnto the Abbey of\nMontiers / and there Raymondyn prayed god deuoutly\nthat he wold help hym att his nede, and to brynge hys\nenterpryse to a good ende, and to the saluacion of his\nsowle & prouffyt of hys body.

How Raymondyn founde a man\n  that bare the skynne or hyde of a hert /\n  and how he bought it / NOw telleth thystorye to vs, that whan\nRaymondyn had herd hys masse, and that he had\nended his prayere / he went out of the chirche / and\nat thyssue of thabbey byond the Castel he found a\nman whiche bare within a sac vpon hys bak the hyde\nof an hert, which man camme toward Raymondyn, and\nsaid to hym in this manere.  'Sire, wyl bye this hertis skynne that I haue within my sack, for to\nmake good huntyng cordes for your hunters.'  'By my\nfeyth,' said Raymondyn / 'ye / yf thou wilt selle it;\nand at one word what shall I paye for hit?'  'By my\nfeyth, sire,' said the man, 'ye shall paye to me for it\nten shelynges, or ellis ye shall not haue it.'  'Frend,'\nsaid thanne Raymondyn to the said man / 'bryng it\nhome with me and I shall pay the there.'  And he\nanswer&dtail;, 'With a good wille.'  Thanne he followed\nRaymondyn vnto his hous, and there he delyuered hys\nhyde / and Raymondyn payed hym for it.  And anone\nafter, Raymondyn sent for a Sadelmaker, to whom he\nsaid: 'My frend, yf it plese you, ye muste cutte this\nhyde in fourme of a thonge, in the narowest & smallest\nwyse that is possible to be doo.'  The Sadler dide cutte\nit, and after they leyd it agayn within the sac thus\ncutte.  What shuld I nowe prolonge the\nmatere.  It is trouth that they whiche were commytted for to\ndelyuere to Ramondyn his yefte, rode, and\nRaymondyn with them, toward the fontayne of soyf, so\nlon&gtee; that they cam vnto the roche that standeth ouer\nthe said fontayne, where as grett tranchis or keruyn&gtee;\nwas made within the harde roche / and they fon&dtail; al\nabout it grete trees throwen doun to the groun&dtail;,\nwherof they were gretly meruaylled, For it was out of\nmans mynde that euer trees were cutte there\naboute.  Raymondyn, that thanne wel knewe that his lady had\nwrought there, held hys peas.  And whan they were\nwithin the medowe they toke the thonge out of the\nsac /.", "12": "Cap. XII.  How they that were ordonned camme\n  and delyuered to Raymondyn his yefte. / WHan they that shuld delyuer the yefte saw\nthe hyde cutte so smalle, they were of it alle\nabasshed / and said to Raymondyn \u00feat they wyst not\nwhat to doo / And there incontynent camme to them two\nmen clothed with cours cloth / the whiche said in this\nmanere.  'We are comme hither for to helpe you.'  Thanne\nthey toke out of the sack the hyde and bare it vnto\nthe bottomme of the valley, as nigh the roche as they\ncoude / and there they dide sette a stake in the erthe,\nand to this stake they fasted the one ende of the hyde /\nand as they went they sette stakes for to hold with the\nsaid thonge rounde aboute the roche / and whan they\nwere comme ayen to the first stake, there was yet agrete\nremenant of the thon&gtee; / and for to sette and fournysshe\nit they drew it dounward to the valey / and so fer\nthey went with it, that they camme to the ende of\nit.  And ye must knowe that after that, it is said in the\nCountre, and as the very and true history witnesseth /\nthere sprange at [the] ende of the said thon&gtee; a fayr\nfontayn, the whic&hbar; rendred so moche of watre that a\nryuere wexed or grew therof.

And also they were meruaylled of the grete\ngrounde that the thonge compassed.  but neuertheles they delyuered to Raymondyn the groun&dtail; that was\ngyuen to hym after the texte or tenour of hys\nlettres.  And as soone as they had delyuered it, they wyst neuer\nwhere the said two men that were comme there for to\nhelpe hem becamme, ne whither they were goon. Thanne they departed alle togidre, for to haue\nretourned vnto Poyters, where as whan they were\ncomme, they dide telle and recounte vnto the Erle and\nto his moder this meruayllous auenture.  And thanne\nthe lady said to her sonne in this manere: 'Byleue thou\nneuer of no thinge me / of that I shall say / but yf\nRaymondyn hath founde somme auenture in the Forest\nof Coulombyers, For the same Forest is somtyme full\nof moche meruayllous auentures.'

As they spake thus togidre,\nRaymondin arryued / whiche kneeled soone byfore the\nErle and thanked hym of the worship & curtoysy that\nhe had doon to hym.  'By my feyth, Raymondyn,'\nsaid the Erle, 'ye thanke me of a lytil thin&gtee;, but\nbetre I shall doo to you, with godis grace, in tyme to\ncomme.'  'Now, my frend Raymondyn,' said the Erle,\n'it is told to me of a grete and meruayllous auenture\nwhiche is happed as of present in the place that I\nhaue doon to be delyuered to you by my\nyefte.  Wherfore I pray you that ye wil telle to me the pure & very\ntrouth of hit.'  'My feyth,' sayd Raymondyn.  'My\nright dere lord / yf they that at your commandement\nhaue delyuered the place to me haue not told you\nof more than they haue seen / they haue doo wel. Neuertheless it is trouth that the space of grounde\ncompassed aboute with the hyde conteyneth two\nmylles.

'My lord,' said Raymondyn,\n'yet haue I not founde but wel & honour / but my\nryght dere lord, I loue my self for to be & there to\ndwelle more than in eny other place, bycause that it is\ncommonly renommed auenturous and welhappy\ncountre / and so I hope god shall send to me some good\nauenture whiche by hys plaisire shall be to me\nworshipfull & prouffytable bothe to my sowle and to my\nbody.

They thenne kyssed eche\nother / & Raymondyn departed fro the lady / of whiche thistory sylenceth / and bygynneth to spek of\nRaymondyn which goth toward Poytiers./ NOw telleth to vs thistorye that so longe rode\nRaymondyn after that he was departed fro his\nlady that he camme to Poiters, wher he fonde the Erle\nand his moder & grete foyson of Barons with them,\nwhiche were right wel glad of his commyn&gtee; / and\ndemanded of hym fro whens he camme.  And he ansuerde\nto them that he camme fro his dysporte.  And after that\nthey had spoken longe tyme of one thin&gtee; and of other,\nRaymondyn yede byfore the Erle & kneled & sayd to\nhym thus: 'Right dere lord, I moche humbly besech\nyou, on alle the seruyses that euer I shall mow doo to\nyou, \u00feat ye vouchesaaf for to doo to me so moche of\nhonour as to comme on monday next to my weddyn&gtee;,\nto the fontayn of Soyf.  and that it playse you to\nbryng thither with you my lady your moder, and\nalle your barons also.'  And whan the Erle vnderstode\nhym he was moche abasshed.  'How,' said the Erle,\n'fayre Cousyn Raymondyn, are ye as now so straunged\nof vs that ye marye you without that we know therof\ntyl the day of weddyn&gtee;?

'Now thanne,' said the Erle, 'telle vs what\nshe is and of what lynee.'  'By my feyth,' said\nRaymondyn, 'ye demande of me a thin&gtee; / to the whiche I\ncan not gyue none ansuere, for neuer in my lyf I ne dide\nenquyre me therof.'

And thenne they lefte to speke of this matere,\nand spake of one thin&gtee; and of other so long, that tyme\nof souper camme.  And notwithstanding, the Erle\nthought euer on Raymondyn and his lady, and said\nin hym self that somme Fortune he had fonde at the\nfontayne of soyf./ IN this manere thoughte longe the Erle, so moche\nthat the styward cam and said to hym: 'My\nlord, all is redy, yf it plese you for to\ncomme.'  'Forsouth,' said he, 'it plaiseth me well.'  Thanne they\nweshe theyre handes, sette at the table / and wel they\nwere serued.  And aftir souper they spak of many\nmateres, & after they went to bed.

And\nas they rode thither the Erle enquyred of Raymondyn\nthe estate of hys wyf, but nothinge he would telle to\nhym therof.  Wherof the Erle was sorowfull, And so\nlonge they yede talking togidre that they camme vpon\nthe hille, where they sawe the grete trenchis or keruyng\nin the harde roche that sodaynly were made / and the\nfontayne also whiche sourdred & spran&gtee; ther\nhaboundauntly.

Thanne aroos Raymondyn and made\nhym redy, and yssued out of the Pauillon.  And as\nthenne were alle redy, both therles of Poyters and of\nForests waytyng aftir Raymondyn, whiche they ledd to\nthe Chapell and there they herde their masse deuotly /\nand after they retourned vnto the medowe, where the\nfeste & reue&llbar; bygan of new, moche grete. but therof\nwe leue to speke. and shall say of the Countesse &\nother ladyes, which aourned & made redy\nMelusyne.  And after they yede and ledd melusine moche\nhonourably vnto the Chapel forsai&dtail; And there they herd\nmasse.  thoffertory of whiche was grete and\nriche.  And after that the deuyne seruyse was doon, they\nretourned vnto the Pauyllon.  What shuld I make long tale herof; the feste was grete and noble, and\nlasted XV dayes complete & hole.  And Melusyne\ngaaf many grete yeftes and jewels both to the ladyes\n& damoyselles, also to knightes & squyers.  And after\nthe feste the Erle, and the Countesse his moder, and\nalle the barons, ladyes, and damoiselles of theire\nfelawship, toke leue of Melusyne, whiche conueyed the said\nCountesse and her doughter vnto & byonde the litil\ntounne of Coulombiers.

And after\nthat all these thinges were doon and perfourmed,\nMelusyne toke leue of the Erle and of the Countesse\nmoche honourably, and of alle the Baronye. and with\na fayre and noble compayny retourned to her\npauillon.  And Raymondin conueyed euer the Erle.  And as\nthey rode on theire way, the Erle of Poytiers said to\nhim in this manere:  'Fayr Cousyn telle me, yf ye\ngoodly may, of what lynee or kynred is your wyf /\nhow be it that thauncyent knight dide thanke us of\nthonour & worship that we bare to you by hys lady\nMelusyne of Albanye. but yet I demande it of you /\nbycause that we gladly wold knowe the certaynte of\nit.

Thystorye saith that thanne Raymondin was\ngretly wroth, whan he herd the requeste\nthat the Erle of Poytiers, his lord, made\nvnto him / and also likewyse the erle of\nForest hys brother.  For he loued / doubted and\npreysed so moche his lady / that he hated alle thinges\nwhiche he demed desagreable to her.  Not\nwithstanding he ansuerd to them full softe & fayr: 'By my feyth,\nmy lord / and you my brother, playse it to you to\nknowe / that by rayson naturel fro whosoever I hyd\nmy secrete / fro you I ought not to hyde it / yf it were\nsuche thinge that I knew of, or might say.  and\ntherfore I shall answere to you, to that ye haue demanded\nof me / after that I knowe of it.  Ye thanne muste\nknowe, that neuer I ne demanded ne dyde enquere me\nso fer of it / as now redyly ye haue demanded &\nenquyred of me, / but so moche I knowe, and may wel\nsay of her, that she is a kyngis doughter, mighty &\nhigh terryen, And by the state, behauyng, &\ngouernement that ye haue seen in her, ye may perceyue\nynough, that she nys ne haue be norysshed in\nmendycite or pouerte / but in superfluyte of honour & largesse,\nand amon&gtee; plente of goodes.  And I requyre you as to\nmy lordes and frendes, that ye ne enquyre nomore\ntherof.  For none other thinge ye ne may knowe\ntherof by me.  and suche as she is, she playseth me\nwel, and am right wel content of her.  And wel I\nknowe that she is the rote of alle myn erthly goodes\npresent & to comme.'  Thenne ansuerd the Erle of\nPoytiers: 'By my feyth, fayr Cousin, as for may part I think not to enquere of you nomore therof, For as ye\nhaue putte vnto vs wysely the high honours, riches,\nmaneres, and behauying of my Cousin, your wyf, we\noughte to conceyue of ourself, that she is noble birth\n& extraction, and of right high and mighty lynee.'  'By\nmy feyth, my lord,' said the Erle of Forest, 'ye say\nsouthe. and of my part I thinke nat to enquyre, ne\ndemande of hym eny thing more therof / how be it\nthat he is my bro\u00feer.  For certaynly I hold hym right\nwel ensuered \u00feerof aftir myn aduys.'  But, helas! he\naftirward faylled Couenaunt. wherfore Raymondyn lost\nhis lady, and also the Erle of Forest toke deth therfore\nby Geffray with the grete tothe, Whereof it shal be\nspoken herafter more playnly.  Raymondyn thenne\ntoke leue of the Erle, & of his brother, and of the\nbarons, and retourned to the fontayne of Soyf.  And\nalso the Erle of Forest toke leue of the erle of Poytiers,\nof hys moder, and of hys sustir, and of a&llbar; the barons\nright honourably, and \u00feanked them alle of thonour\nthat they had doon to him at hys brothers\nweddyng.  And thanne therle of Potyers, his moder, and hys\nSuster, with alle theire felawship & meyne retourned\nto poitiers, and euery one of the Barons retourned to\ntheir Countrees. but there ne was none of them / but\nthat he merueylled & gretly wondred of the grete riches\nthat they had seen at the wedding of\nRaymondyn.  And here resteth thystorye to spek of them / and shal\nspek of Raymondyn & of his lady, how they were\nafter the departyn&gtee; of theire parents and frendes. / Thystory recounteth to vs that whan Raymondin\nwas retourned toward his lady / he founde the\nfeste greter than it was before / and also greter plente\nof noble folk than neuer was there before.  Alle whiche\nfolke yede, & said to hym with a high voyce: 'My\nlord ye be welcomme as he to whom we are seruaunts,\n& whom we wyl obey.'  And \u00feis said the ladyes as wel the lordes.  And thanne Raymondin ansuerd to\nthem, 'gramercy of the honour that ye proffre to me.'\nAnd there thanne camme Melusyne, who moche\nhonourably sayd to hym: 'welcomme be ye' / and had\nhym apart, & reherced to hym word by word alle the\ntalking that was betwix the Erle and hym. and also\nwhat his brother, Erle of Forest, had said, And yet\nsaid the lady to hym: 'Dere frende Raymondin / as\nlonge as ye shal contynue soo / alle goodes shall\nhabounde to you.  Fayre frende, I shall to morowe\ngyue leue to the moost partye of our folk that ben here\ncomme to our feste.  For other thinges we must\nordeyne.'  Raymondyn ansuered: 'ladye, so as it shall\nplayse you.'  And whan the morowe camme Melusyne\ndeparted her folke / grete quantyte went theire way /\nand suche as she wold abode there.  And now resteth\nthystory of the thinges byfore said. and begynne to\ntreate how the lady bygan to bylde the noble fortresse\nof Lusignen. / IN this partye telleth thenne thystory that whan the\nfeste was ended and that suche as she wold were\ngoon / she anoone aftir made to comme grete foyson of\nwerkmen / as massons, Carpenters, and suche that can\ndygge & delue.  Whyche at her commandement fylled\ndounne the grete trees, and made the roche fayre and\nclene.  There Melusyne sett euery man to werk. eche\none dide his Crafte. they encysed the roche & made a\ndepe & brode foundement. and in few dayes they\nbrought the werk so ferfourth / that euery man wondred\nof suche a fayre and stronge bylding so soone doon.\nAnd euery Satirday Melusyne payed truly her\nwerkmen / and meet & drynk they had in haboundaunce.\nbut trouth it is / that no body knew from whens these\nwerkmen were. and wete it that soone was the Fortres\nmade up / not only with one warde / but two strong\nwardes, with double walles were there, or oon coude have comme to the stronge donjon of it.  Round about\nthe walles were gret tours machecolyd, & strong\nposternes / and also barreres or wayes gooyng out forth\nencysed and kerued within the hard roche.  The Erle\nof Poytiers / the barons and alle the peple meruaylled\nmoche of the said werke that so soone was doon, so\ngrete, so stronge, & so fayre.  Then the lady Melusyne\nand her husband Raymondyn lodged them within it.\nand anoone after Raymondin made to calle to a feste\nthere, alle the noble men therabout.  There camme the\nerle of Poytiers, both hys moder and hys suster / the\nErle of Forestz, the Barons & noble men of theire\nlandes, also of other countres and nacions.  And also\nthere was so many laydes & damoyselles, that they\nwel might suffyse att that day.  There was jousting,\ndauncyng, and grete joye made with frendly and\ncurtoys deeling.  And whan Melusyne sawe tyme and\nplace conuenable, she presented herself before the two\nErles / barons and noble men, and humbly said to\nthem in this manere: 'My fayre and good lordes, we\nthanke you moche of the high honoure that ye haue\ndoon to us now at this feste--and the cause why we\nhaue prayed you to comme I shal declare it to you.' / 'LOrdes,' said the lady, 'here I haue assembled your\nnoble personnes, for to haue your Counsei&llbar; how this fortresse shall be called. for that it be in\nmynd how that it hath be happely bylded & made.'\n'By my feyth, fayre Cousyn,' said the Erle of Poiters,\n'we as in general sayen to you, as oure wylle is / that\nye your owneself shall / as right is / gyue name to it.\nFor emong we alle is not so moc&hbar; wyt as in you alone\nthat haue bylded up & achyeuyd so strong and fayre a\nplace as thesame is / and wete it, that none of us\nshall entremete hym to doo that ye spek of.'  Thanne\nsaid Melusyne: 'Dere Sire, Wylfully and for the nones\nye haue kept \u00feis ansuere for to jape with me. but what therof is, I requyre and pray you that therof ye telle to\nme your entencion.'  'Certaynly, dere Cosyn,' sayd the\nErle of Poytiers, 'none of us alle shal medle with a&llbar;.\nbyfore you.  For by reason / sethen ye haue so moche\ndoon as to haue achyeued & made the moste strong\nand fayre place that ever man sawe in this Countree /\nye owe to gyue name to it your owne self after your\nplaysire.'  'Ha / ha, my lord,' said Melusyne, 'sith it ne\nmay none otherwise be, / and that I see your playsire\nis that I gyue name to it, hit shalbe called after myn\nowne name, Lusygnen.'  'But my feyth,' said the Erle,\n'the name setteth full wel to it for two causes, First\nbycause ye are called Melusyne of Albanye, whiche\nname in grek language is as moc&hbar; for to say / as thing\nmeruayllous or commyng fro grete merueylle, and also\nthis place is bylded and made meruayllously.  For I\nbyleue not other wyse / but that as longe as the world\nshal laste shall there be founde & seen somme Wonder\n& meruayllous thinge.'  Thanne they alle ansuerd in\nthis manere: 'My lord, no man in the world might gyue\nbetre name, that bettre shuld sette to it than she hath\ndoo after manere of the place / also aftir the interpretyng\nmade by you of her owne name.' and on this oppynyon\n& worde were alle of one acorde.  Whiche name\nwithin few dayes was so publyed, that it was knowen\nthrugh alle the land. and yet at this day it is called\nsoo.  They soone aftir toke leue, and Melusyne and\nRaymondin also gaaf hem dyuers & riche yeftes at\ntheire departyng.  And herafter sheweth thystory how\nRaymondin and Melusyne / right wysly, mightily and\nhonorably lyued togidre. / After the feste was ended, Melusyne, that was grete\nwith child, bare her fruyte unto \u00fee tyme that\nalle wymen owen to be delyured of their birthe. and\nthanne she was delyuered of a man child, whiche was\nmoche fayre, and wel proporcyoned or shapen in alle hys membres / except his vysage that was short and\nlarge / one ey he had rede, and the other blew.  he\nwas baptysed, & named was Uryan, and wete it that\nhe had the gretest eerys that euer were seen on eny\nchild of hys age / and whan they were ouergrowen,\nthey were as grete as the handlyng of a fan.  Melusyne\n\u00feenne called to hym Raymondin, and to hym she said\nin this manere: 'My ryght swete felawe & frend, I\nwold not see thyn owne herytage to be lost / which by\nraison thou oughtest to haue by vertue of patrymonye,\nfor Guerrende Penycence and all the marches aboute\napparteynen to the & to \u00fey brother / goo thanne\nthither, and make the king of Bretons to be sommed\nthat he wyl receyue you in your ryght & enherytance /\nshewyng to hym how your fader slew his nevew in\ndeffense & warde of hys owne body.  For whic&hbar;\nencheson doubting the sayd kyng / lefte the Countrey,\nand neuer durst retourne / and yf he wyl not receyue\nyou to ryght, be not therof abasshed.  For afterward\nhe shal be glad, & fayne whan he shal mow doo it.'\nThenne ansuerd Raymondyn, 'there nys nothing that\nye commande me, but that I shall doo after my power.\nFor wel I considere & see that all your werkes ne\ntenden but to wele & worship.'  'Frende,' sayd the lady,\n'it is wel rayson, sith that all your trust ye putte on\nme that I hold to you trouth.  It is trouth that your\nfader, by hys predecessors, oweth to haue many grete\nthinges in bretayne, the whiche shulle be declared unto\nyou whan ye be there.  It muste thanne be by you\nunderstand, that Henry of Leon, your fader, that tyme\nhe was in Bretayn for hys worthynes, grete policye &\nvaliauntnes, and as he that drad no man that owed hym\neuyl wy&llbar; he was moche loued with the kinge there /\nin so moche that the said kynge made hym hys\nSeneschall & Captayn general ouer alle his men of\nwerre.  This king of Bretons had a nevew / but no child begoten of his body he had.  Whyche nevew, by\nthe introduction of som, had grete enuye on Henry,\nyour fader.  For to hym they said in this manere:\n\"Ha! Ha! right-full heyre of Breytayne.  Woo is us to\nsee your grete domage / that is / you to be putte doun\nfro the noble enherytaunce of Bretayne. yf by fawte\n& lak of courage ye suffre it, what shal men say?\n\u00feey poyntyng you with the fynger shal sey, Loo,\nyonder is the fole that for his feynted herte hath be\nputte out of so noble enherytaunce as is the royame of\nBretayne.\"  And whan he understode the said enjurous\nwordes, he said: \"Who is he that dare vsurpe & take\nfro me my right, I knowe none / but that god wyl\nhaue me to be punysshed. and wel I wot, \u00feat the\nkinge, my lord & oncle, wyl not take ony other to be\nhys heyer than my self.\"  Thenne sayd one of them to\nhym: \"By my feyth, ye are [not] enfourmed in this\nmatere, For the kinge, your oncle, hath made &\nordeyned hys heyre, Henry of Leon, and as now\nletters of graunt ben therof made.\"  Whan the yong man\nherd these wordes, he as wood wroth ansuerd to them,\n\"wete it for certeyn / that if I knew these wordes to\nbe trew, I shuld putte hastly remedy thereto / in so\nmoche that neuer he shold hold land ne no possession.\"\nAnd thenne ansuerde to hym a knight named Josselyn\nDupont: \"certaynly it is soo / and for we wold haue\nnone other to be kynge in brytaynne but you, after the\ndecees of \u00fee kinge, we warne you therof.  For this\nhath the kyng your oncle doon secretly, for ye shuld\nnot knowe of it. and wete it that alle we that now are\nhere, were present whan that couenaunt was made.\naske my felawes yf I say trouth or not.\" he demanded\nof them yf it was so, And they ansuerd \"ye.\" 'The yongman thanne said, \"Fayre lordes, I thanke\nyou of your good wylle whiche ye shewe to me,\ngoo youre way.  For wel I shall kepe Henry therfro.\" They toke theyre leue, For they rought not for no\nthing that might fall therof, so that they might see\nyour faders deth.  For enuyous and wroth they were\nthat the kinge louyd hym so wel, and for nought sette\nthey were by hym.  knowe ye muste, that on the\nsonday next, in the morning, the kingis nevew armed\nhym self / yede in to the wod of Leon Castel, and\nthere wayted tyl your fader passed by, whiche he\nperceyued gooyng alone to hys dysport about hys\nCastel of Leon / thinkynge on none euyl ne harme /\nand sodaynly cryed on hym, \"Now shalt thou dey, false\ntraytour, that fro me woldest haue and vsurpe myn\nherytage\" / and foynyng at hym with hys swerd, wold\nhaue ouerthrawen youre fader. but he glanched asyde /\nand so the kyngis nevew / for he recountred ayenst\nnothing, fell doun to the grounde, and the swerd\nscaped fro hys hand that then your fader toke up, the\nsayd neuew that sawe hys wepen lost, toke a lytil knyf\nthat he had and ranne ayenst hym / but your fader,\nwith the pomel of the swerd, gaaf to hym suche a\nstroke on the heed / that notwithstanding hys yron\nhat, he broke hys heed so that he fe&llbar; doun deed, but whan he knew that it was he / he was sory and woo /\nretourned home / toke all hys hauoyr and goodes\nmeuable, and came in to the Shyre that men now call\nForests, and grette help & comfort he founde in a lady,\nof whyche as now I kepe me styl to spek ony ferther.\nAnd after the departyng of her fro hym, he toke by\nmaryage the sustir of hym that thoo dayes gouerned\nthe erledome of Poytiers, on whyche he gate many\nchildren of the whyche ye are one. / 'Frend,' said Melusyne, 'now haue I deuysed and\nreherced to you how your fader departed fro\nBretayn, and lefte hys landes and possessyons voyde,\nwithout lord, whiche owen to be yours.  You thenne\nshal goo toward an vncle of yours whiche is called Alayn of Quyngant / and ye shal make you to be\nknowen of hym / and he shal byleue you ynough of\na&llbar; that ye shall sey. he hath two wrorthy knightes\nto hys sones, the whiche are grete men with the kinge,\nand loueth hem wel. by one of them, your Cousyns,\nye shall make Josselyn Dupont, that as yet is alyue,\nto be called byfore the kyng, and there ye shalle acuse\nhym of the treson by hym & other machyned / thrugh\nwhiche the kyngis nevew, willing to haue destroyed\nyour fader, was hym self slayn.

Now my ryght swete frend & felawe,\ndouteles goo surely.  For certaynly god shal helpe you\nin all your juste & true dedes.' Thanne ansuerd Raymondyn: 'Madame, I shall\nendeuoyre me to achyeue & fulfi&llbar; your\ncommandement.'  Raymondyn toke leue of Melusyne /\nand acompanyed with grete nombre of knightes and\nsquyers, rode fourth so long on hys way, tyl they\ncame in Brut Brytayne, wher the peuple was abasshed\n& moche wondred what suche grete nombre of\nstraungers wold haue.  But for they payed wel &\nlargely for that they toke, they were ensured that they\nwold & sought but good.  For thauncyent knight of\nthe meyne of Melusyne rewled and gyded them alle\nin a&llbar; honour & goodnes.  And for they were not so\nvnpurueyed / but that with them they had armures,\nwith them yf nede were to arme them with / the\nkinge that knew of it, sent to them to wete what they sought, whiche message demanded of Raymondyn yf hee\nowed euyl wy&llbar; to the kyng & to hys royame.  In this\nmessagery or embassade were sent two wyse knightes,\nwhiche wysly enquered of Raymondyn as byfore is\nsayd what he sought and what he wold. to whome\nRaymondin full curtoysly ansuered thus. 'Fayre\nlordes, ye sha&llbar; te&llbar; to my liege that I come but for\ngood and wele, and for to haue the lawful right in\nhys Court of suche thinges as belongen to me, For the\nwhiche I shall presente myn owne personne byfore hys\nmageste, the same requyryng of socour and help.'\n'Forsouth,' ansuerd the two knyghtes, 'ye shalbe welcome\nwhan it shal playse you to do soo. and wete it wel that\nthe kynge, our liege, is rightwyse & juste / and nothing\nas fer as right requyreth shal not be by hym denyed\nby ony wyse. but telle vs yf it lyke you whither ye\nare now bounde.'  'Certaynly,' said Raymondyn, 'I\nwold I were at Quyngant.'  Thanne answerd one of\nthem, 'ye are wel on the way toward it, and wete that\nye shall fynd there Aleyn of Leon, whiche sha&llbar; make\nyou good chere.  and also ye sha&llbar; fynd there two\nknightes, men of wele and honour, and hold strayte\nthis way and ye shal not mys of it, and with your leue\nwe retourne on our way toward oure liege.' Whanne these two knightes were fer fro\nRaymondyn and hys felawship an halfmyle, they\nbyganne to say one to other: 'By my feyth, yonder\nare gentyl and curtoys folkes, worshipfu&llbar; &\nhonourable.  For certayn they come not into this land\nwithout it is for some grete matere.'  and yet sayd, 'lete\nvs go thrugh Quyngan; and to aleyn we sha&llbar; anounce\ntheyre commyng.'  they toke the way toward it, and\nrode so fast that soone they came there where they\nfound Alayn, to whome they said & announced the\ncommyng of Raymondyn and of his men.  Whiche\nAlayn wondred moc&hbar; of it.  And thanne the trew man dide calle to hym hys two sones, of whiche one\nwas called Alayn & was eldest, and that other yongest\nhad to name Henry, and he sayd to them in this\nmanere: 'My good children, lepe on horsbak and ryde\non your way to mete yonde straungers / receyue ye\nthem worshipfully, and see that they be wel and\nhonestly lodged.  For it is told to me, that they be\nsix houndred horses or theraboute.' but for nought he\nspak.  For thauncyent knyght of Melusyne was come\nbefore that / and seeying the toune was to lityl for to\nhaue herberowed so moche peple in it / had made to\nbe dressed tentes & pauyllons, and sent aboute in the\nCountre for suche thinges that necessary were to them,\nwhic&hbar; he payed or mayd to be payd largely, in so moche\nthat more vytay&llbar; was there brought than \u00feey neded of.\nAnd thanne Alayn was a&llbar; abasshed whan he herd of\nthat grete hauoyr & apparey&llbar; that they made there,\nand wyst not what therof he shuld thinke or say. Now sayth thystory, that so long rode the two\nbrethern with theyre felawship togidre, that\nthey mete with Raymondin, & fu&llbar; curtoysly\nwelcommed hym, and prayed hym by byddyng of Alayn,\ntheyre fader, that he vouchesauf to comme and be\nlodged within the Fort or Castel of Qyngant with\ntheyre fader, that shuld make hym good chere.  'Fayre\nlordes,' said Raymondyn, 'gramercy to your fader, and\nthanked be you of your curtoysy that ye thus proffre\nto me, But at your requeste I shall goo toward your\nfader for to rendre to hym reuerence.  For glad &\nfayn I were to see hym, for the wele & honour that I\nhave herde say by hym.'  Contynuyng suche wordes\n& o\u00feer they rode tyl they came nygh the toun.  And\nthann came there thauncyent knight to Raymondyn,\nand sayd: 'Sire, I have made your pauyllon to be\ndressed vp, and tentes ynoughe for to lodge you & al\nyour men, and thanked be god we are wel purueyed.' 'Ye haue doo wel,' sayd Raymondin / 'goo and make\nye mery and chere my men, and loke not for me this\nnyght, For I goo to the Fortresse with this two\ngentylmen.'  And thenne departed he fro thauncyent knight /\ntoke with hym a few of hys moost famyler men, and\nyede to the Fortresse wher the lord of the place aborde\nfor hym sty&llbar; at the gate.  Whan Raymondyn thanne\nsawe hym as to hys lord and vncle he made reuerence\n& salewed hym mekely.  Wherto shulde I vse prolixe\nor longe wordes of theyre acoyntaunce.  but of the\nfaitt or matere whiche I owe to uttre and say, Lete vs\n\u00feenne say.  Whan they had souped / wesshen & graces\nsaid / the lord of the place toke Raymondyn by the\nhand / had hym apart upon a benc&hbar; / there to deuyse\nboth togidre, whyle that the other souped / the whiche\n\u00fee two bretheren chered & honestly seruyd.  The lord\nAlayn thanne wyse and subtyl, and that knewe moche\nof wel and honour, bygan to raissonne with Raymondin\nin this manere: 'Sir knight, grete joye I haue of your\ncommyng hither, For certaynly ye are full lyke to a\nbrother of myn whiche was valyaunt, fu&llbar; wyse and\nworthy.  he departed fro this land xl. yere goon, for\na stryf that befe&llbar; betwix the nevew of the kinge that\nreygned at that tyme and hym, and wete it that this\nis the iiijth kynge that haue reyned syn that tyme vnto\nnow.  And bycause that, to me seemeth ye resemble\nmy brother, I am the more glad & fayn to see you.'\n'Sire,' said Raymondyn, 'therof I mercy & thanke\nyou / and or I departe from you I shall make you certayn\nwherfore and by what inconuenience the stryf that ye\nspek of happed betwixt the nevew of the kyng and\nyoure brother.  For wete it, that for none other cause\nI come hither.  but for to shewe publiquely the pure\ntrouth & certeyntee thereof.' Whan Alayn herd these wordes he was moche\nabasshed, and loked on Raymondyn moche ententyfly, and after sayd, 'and how shal that mowe be?\nye haue not yet the age of xxx yere / by you may not\nbe recounted the faytte, the trouth of whiche none\nmight neuer knowe.  For whan the stroke of the\nmysdede happed.  my brother sodaynly departed / so\nthat I ne none other herd neuer syn whither he was\nbecome.'  'Sire, yf ye vouchesaf / telle mee yf there\nis as now yet lyuyng eny man that had on that tyme\nauctorite or rewle aboute the kinge that regned whan\nthe stryf befe&llbar;.'  'By my feyth,' said Alayn, 'one and\nno more I knowe, that had gouernaunce in Court that\nsame tyme, and he hym self vsurpeth & holdeth my\nbrothers landes as his owne enherytaunce.  For the\nkyng gaaf it to hym, for hys first begoten sone to\nenjoye it for euermore, the which hys sone is now of\nlate dowbed & made knight.'  'For southe,' sayd thenne\nRaymondyn, 'wel I wote hys name.'  'And how know\nye hyt?' said Alayn.  'By my feyth,' sayd Raymondin,\n'he is called Josselin Dupont / and hys sone hys named\nOlyuyer.'  'Sire knight,' sayd Alayn, 'ye say trouth.\nBut telle me how ye this may knowe.'  'Sire,' sayd\nRaymondyn, 'no ferther ye sha&llbar; as now know therof.\nbut ye vouchesaf to come & your two sones with me,\nunto the kinges Court / wete it that I shall declare\nvnto you the quarrell & stryf so clerly that, yf ye\neuer loued your brother, Henry of Leon, ye shal be\nthereof fayn & glad.'  And thanne Alayn heryng the\nname of hys brother called, he was more abasshed than\nbefore.  For he wend none other but that hys brother\nhad be long deed.  And thenne he thoughte longe in\nhymself or he ansuerd ony word. Thus, as I haue sayd to you / moche long thought\nAlayne, and aftir he ansuerd: 'Sire knight, I\ngraunt & acorde me to your requeste / sethen that here\nI ne may knowe your wy&llbar;.  For therat I lang moche.\nI gladly shall hold you company vnto the kynges Court.'  'gramercy,' sayd Raymondyn, 'and wel I shal\nkepe you fro dommage.'  Wherto shuld I make long\nproces, Alayn manded or sent for a grete foyson of hys\nfrendes, & made hym redy in grete estate for to goo to\nthe court.  The kynge that knew theire commyng\ndeparted fro Storyon, where he laye, & came to\nNantes.  For the two knightes whiche the kinge sente\nRaymondyn were retourned, & had recounted to the\nkinge the ansuere of Raymondyn, and the maner of his\nestate.  And therfore the kinge was come to Nantes\nand manded a part of hys baronye, For he wold not\nthat Raymondyn shuld fynd hym vnpurueyd of men.\nAnd amonge other he sent for Josselin Dupont for to\nhaue his Counsey&llbar; on the demande that Raymondyn\nwold make.  For he was moche sage.  What shuld I\nsaye more? thauncyent knight came before & made\nto be dressed bothe pauillons tentes & purueyed for\na&llbar; thinges necessary.  Wherfore the folke of the\ntoune were moche abasshed of the grete appareyl that\nhe caused to be made / Thenne came Raymondyn,\nAlayn, and bothe his sones, and descended into the\nchief Pauillon, where they made them redy and arayed\nthem fu&llbar; richely, for to goo toward the kinge / and\nafter they departed fro the tentes, acompanyed with\nxl knightes wel horsed and honestly arayed that\nwonder was to see / and had his barons with hym.  And\nwhan they come to the kinges place they descended\nfro theire horses / and Raymondyn / Alayn and his\ntwo sones entred within the halle, there the kynge\nwas acompanyed with his barons / made to the kinge\nreuerence / after siewyng, salewed the barons & lordes,\nthe kinge welcommed & receyued \u00feem joyously / called\nto hym Alayn, and said to hym in this manere: 'It gyueth me grete wonder,' said the kinge to Alayn,\n'of this gracyous straunge knight, with whome\nye are so acoynted / What he seketh in this land.'  'Ha / ha, sire,' ansuerd Alayn.  'I am an houndred tymes\nmore meruaylled of the wordes that he yestirday\nshewed vnto me / than ye are of his commyng, but\nsoone shu&llbar; be declared al that we lang aftir & desire\nto knowe.'  Thenne Raymondyn, dressyng hys wordes\nto theldest sone of Alayn, sayd softly in this manere,\n'Sire knight, say me of your Curtoysye, yf one called\nJosselyn Dupont be now in this company or nat.'\nThanne sayd Alayn, 'ye--and wold to god so that\nthe kyng shuld not be dyspleased that I had slayn hym.\nFor he enjoyeth therytage that apparteyneth to one our\noncle which we shuld haue.'  And after these wordes\nAlayn sayd to Raymondin / 'it is yond auncient knight\nthat sitteth by the kinge.  And wete it for certayn\nthat he is replenysshed with all falshed & malyce /\nand yonder is his son Olyuyer that weyeth not an\nownce lasse in a&llbar; wykkednes & euy&llbar;.'  'By my feyth,\nSire knight,' sayd Raymondin / 'ye soone shal be\nauenged of hym yf god wyl.'  And leuyng theire\ntalkyng, Raymondin hadd hymself fourth before the\nkinge, to whom he said in this manere: 'ha, high sire\n& mighty kinge, It is wel trouth that common renoumee\nranneth thrughe alle landes. that your Court is so\nnoble & so raysonnable that it may be called fountayne\nof Justice & raison / and that none ne commeth to\nyour Court but that ye shew & gyue to hym good\nJustice and raisonnable after the good right that he\nhath.'  'By my feyth, sire knight,' said the kinge /\n'it is trouth. but wherfore say you so, fayn I wold wete\nit.'  'Forsouthe, sire,' said Raymondin, 'for to vttre &\nshew it vnto you / I am come hither / & for none other\ncause. but, Sire, yf it plaise you / or I telle it you /\nye sha&llbar; promyse me that ye sha&llbar; susteyne me ayenst\nalle personnes after right & raison.  For that / that I\nshal say is in a part your wele prouffyt & honour.\nFor no kinge acompanyed of a traytour is not wel lodged ne sure of his personne.'  'By my feyth,' said\nthe king, 'ye say trouth / say on hardily.  For I swere\nto you by a&llbar; that I hold of god, that I shal doo to you\nalle Justice & rayson after the good right that ye sha&llbar;\nhaue / and that shal I doo doubteles / yf it were ayenst\nmy brother.'  'Sire,' said Raymondin, 'an houndred\nthousand thankes & mercyes / ye say as a valyaunt kynge\n& trew man.  For first were kynges stablysshed for\nto rendre or yeld to euerbody juste jugement in alle\nthinges.' 'Noble mighty kinge,' said Raymondin / 'it is wel\ntrouth that one, your predecessour kynge,\nreyned somtyme moche mightily & valyauntly that was\nin the tyme of Josselin Dupont and of Alayn, whiche\nbothe are here now present before your majeste / this\nkynge whiche I spek of, had a moche fayre & noble yong\nman to his nevew. that tyme was in this Countre a\nbaron whiche was called Henry of Leon, the whiche\nwas brother to Alayn here present.'  'By my feyth, sire,'\nsaid thanne Josselyn, 'he saith trouth.  and ouermore\nthe same Henry of Leon slew the nevew of your\npredecessour by treson / fledd out of this land, and neuer\nsyn came hither ayen.  And then the kinge seased\nhis landes and possessyons, and anoone after gaf them\nto me.'  The kinge thanne ansuered, 'we haue herd\nynoughe of this matere / but suffre this knight fynyshe\nhis raison which he hath bygonne.' TO this ansuerd Raymondyn, 'Sire kinge, he hath\nwel raison to speke of hit, For ferthermore he\nshal be constrayned to say / how be it that as now he\nhath said amys & not trouth of that he saith that\nHenry of leon slew the kinges nevew in treson, For he\nknew wel why & wherfore it was, and there nys no\nman lyuyng that can say the trouth of it but he alone,\nFor they that were of his acorde and conspiracion ben\nal deed.  Therfore sire kynge, vouchesaf to command hym telle trouth al on hye, that eueryone here may here it.'  And whan Josselin vnderstode that word,\nhe wexed sore abasshed; neuertheles, he ansuered in\nthis manere: 'Sire knight, are you come into this\nland forto vndertake eny thinge in dyshonour of me?'\nAnd Raymondin ansuerd appertly: 'Fals traytour, he\nfourueyeth nat that saith the playn trouth.'  Thanne\nhe said agayn to the kynge: 'Sire, it is wel trouth that\nHenry of Leon was a moche valiant & hardy knight,\ncurteys and wel condicyoned, & moche was beloved\nbothe of the kinge and of his nevew / and vsed the\nkynge moche of his counseil, For he was he on whom\nhe trusted most. It haped that dyuerse traytours beyng\nthat time about the kinge, of which Josselin here\npresent was one, as chef causer of the mysdede that\ntyme perpetred or doon / came to said  kingis nevew,\n& to hym they said in this manere: \"Gentyl Squyer,\nalle we that are here byfore your presence ben sory &\nwoo of your grete dommage and shamfu&llbar; losse whan\nye shall be dysheryted of so noble a land as is the\nroyame of Brytayne\" / and he ansuered to them / \"how\nshuld that mowe be doo? the kynge hath none heyre\nbut my self.\"  \"On my god,\" said thanne yond Josselin\nto hym, \"Wete it \u00feat he hath made & stablisshed his\nheyre, Henry of Leon, and I byleue that this Henry\nhath enchaunted hym and the barons of the land also,\nFor therof ben lettres passed & sealled with theire\nsealles annexed to the kingis grete seall / and al this\nthey a&llbar; togider affermed on theire feyth for trouth.\"\n\"By my feith,\" said the squyer thanne / \"here is grete\ninconuenyence yf that be trew that ye telle me.\" And\nthanne Josselin with his complices alle with an acorde\nsware yet ayen to hym that it was trouth.  Wherfore\nthe said yonge squyer was sory and woo.  Josselin\nthenne seeyng that he byleued theire falsed to be\ncertayn, said yet agayn to the squyer in this manere: \"Yf in you lyeth so moc&hbar; hardynes that ye dare\nvndertake to auenge the wrong doon to you by Henry of\nLeon, We alle shal helpe you therto.\"  And the squyer\nansuerd, \"my courage and wylle ben agreed to do\nsoo.\"  Thenne said Josselin, \"goo thanne & arme you\nin a manner vnknowen, and we sha&llbar; abyde you with\nout the toune, and sha&llbar; ledd you in to suche a place\nwhere ye shal auenge you at your ease.\"  O noble &\nmighty kinge, sethen I fynde now myself in Court of\nright & iustice / and that I may see myn enemye, I\nwyl no more be hyd, but lete euery man knowe that\nI am the sone of Henry of Leon.'  Thenne they were\nalle abasshed of that word, but they held them styl /\nand Raymondyn spake fourth in this manere./ 'Sire kinge, it is trouth that my fader had take leue\nof the kinge, and was goon in to hys Countrey /\nand was wonnt euery mornyng for to goo in a wode\nnygh by his fortesse to dysporte hym, sayeng hys\nmatyns alone.  And this fals traytour Josselin, with his\ncomplices, ledd the said kingis nevew and embusshed\nthem there.  My fader, that thoughte no harme, came\nthat same ooure / and whan Josselin perceyued hym\ncommyng he said to the squyer / \"now it is tyme to\nauenge you, For he is without eny armure or wepen /\nhe may not escape you / and yf we see that ye nede of\nhelp we shall helpe you.\"  The squyer, thanne esprysed\nwith euyl desire, departed fro them and ranne toward\nmy fader and escryed hym to deth / and as he wold\nhaue thrested the swerd thrugh my faders body. my\nfader glanched asyde / and as god wold he that fyersly\nranne fe&llbar; to the ground.  My fader \u00feenne toke the\nswerde that scaped fro the squyers hand, and with the\npomel of it smote hym under the eere by suche\nstrengthe that the squyer fe&llbar; doun ded.  And thenne\nwhan my fader saw hym lyeng on the ground deed he\ndyscouered his face, and anone he knew hym, wherfore he made grete sorow and was sory woo and / and after\nthe dede & euylhap, doubtyng the furour & yre of the\nking, yede there hys hauoir was / toke it and fledd\nwith a&llbar; from \u00feis land.  And thanne Josselin the fals\ntraytour sayd to hys complices and felawes: \"Now are\nwe come to our entencion & wylle.  For the kinges\nnevew is deed, and yf Henry be take he may not scape\nfro deth.  Now shal we gouerne and doo with the king\nthat we lyst after our guyse / lete vs not meve us tyl\nhe be ferre from vs / and after we shal take the corps\n& putte it in a byere that we shal make with braunches\n& leues, and so we shal bere it toward the king, to\nwhom we shal say that Henry of Leon slew hym in\ntreson.\"  Ha / ha, noble king, a&llbar; euen so as I say, dide\nthat yonder fals traytour / and yf he say nay / here I\npresente & cast my gage of bataill agents hym.  And\nbycause, sire kinge, that I wil lete euery man knowe\nthat I doo vndertake \u00feis not for auarice / but for to\nkepe my right and enherytaunce / and for to declare,\nmanyfeste, and shewe the vylonny and euyl treson\nthat this fals traytour Josselin and hys complices dyde\nto Henry of Leon, my fader, for to haue hym out of\nconceytte, and to be putte fro the kingis Court, I\nbesech your highnes that he may take hys sone Olyuer\nand another yet of his frendes / and I shal fight ayenst\nthem thre without fawte, prouyded alwayes the noble\nand juste jugement of your Court / one after another' /\nand sayeng these wordes he kyst his gage.  but there\nwas none that spake or ansuerd ony word.  And whan\nAlayn and his two sones vnderstode alle that\nRaymondyn had said / what for joye to see theire faders nevew\nand Cousyn to them / and what for pyte to here telle\nthe trayson so machyned ayenst theyre faders brother\n& vncle to them / ranne to kysse and embrased\nRaymondyn. Whan the king of the Bretons sawe that no body\nansuerd to these wordes so proferid in hys\npresence / sayd al on high that euery one there might\nhere hym, 'how now, Josselin, are ye deef?  / I now\nperceyue wel & see that the prouerbe that is said commonly\nis trew / that is / \"that olde synne reneweth shame,\"\nFor this knight straunger bringeth you tydynges,\nmoche straunge and a wonder medecyne fro ferre land /\naduyse you of that ye shal ansuere.'  Thanne ansuerd\nJosselyn to the kyng: 'Sire kinge, I am not he \u00feat\nfrom hens fourth oweth to ansuere such thinges.  And\nalso wel I byleue that he saith it but in jape & sport.'\nThanne ansuerd Raymondin, 'the mocke fals traytour\nshal tourne on the.  I now requyre you, noble king,\nthat this matere may be discuted / lete him haue as\nraison requyreth for his treson / and I to be punysshed\nyf in eny poynt forsayd [I] haue myssaid or mesprysed.'\nThenne said the kinge, 'doubt not of it, For so shal\nI doo.  Josselyn,' said the kinge, 'ye muste ansuere to\nthis quare&llbar; & acusacion.'  Whan thenne his sone\nOlyuyer herd what the kyng said to his fader / he\nansuerd to his wordes: 'Sire, that knight is so sore\nadrad that he trembleth for fere / he weneth as me\nsemeth to take the cranes flighing, by my feith he\nshall wel fay&llbar; & mysse of that he hath said, For my\nfader is a true man in a&llbar; his dedes / and I vouchesauf\n& graunt the batai&llbar; as he hath ordonned / and there\nis my gage / he shal be wel happy yf he dyscomfyte\nme and another of my lynage suche as I sha&llbar; chese. /' Whan the king herd that word he was moche\nwroth, & ansuerd in this manere / 'that sha&llbar;\nnat happe in my Court as long as I sha&llbar; lyue \u00feat one\nknight alone shal fyght ayenst two for oo maner\nquare&llbar; / and grete shame is to you / only to haue\nthought it in your herte / and wete it  / that by\nsemblaunt ye shew nat your fader to haue good quare&llbar;. And fro this ooure fourthor I gyue you journey of\nbatay&llbar; at the requeste of the knight straunger on suche\nday that he sha&llbar; assigne.'  'By my feyth,' said thenne\nRaymondin, 'I am euen now redy therto, for myn\narmures are not ferre. and thanked be your highnesse\nan hondred tymes of your lawfu&llbar; graunt.'  There had\nye herd grete rumoure made on a&llbar; sydes, for a&llbar; said,\n'yonder is the moste valyaunt knight that euer we sawe\nrequyryng his ryght.'  but what so euer was woofull\ntherof, Alayn of Quyngant & his two sones were fayn\n& glad that so shuld be doo / & said to Raymondin,\n'Fayre Cousin, be not abasshed of nothing in the\nworld.  take boldly the batai&llbar; for you, and for us\nboth ayenst that same fals traytour / For yf god wil\nwe sha&llbar; soone haue worship thereof.'  'Fayre lordes,'\nsaid Raymondin, 'take who wil batai&llbar; for hymself.\nFor the same I shal haue for my part, and doubte you\nnot but that I shal bring it to a good & worshipful\nende god before with the good right that I haue\ntherto.' Whilles the rumour was among the folk, the\nkinge, moche wyse & subtyl / for that the\nparties were of grete & high parentage & lynee /\ndoubtyng of some grete inconuenience that might happe\nemong them / commanded sodaynly the gates to be\nshette that none might entre ne yssue / & ordonned\nmen armed to kepe euery man therfro. and aftir callid\nhis Consei&llbar; apart / shewed to them and reherced a&llbar;\nthe quare&llbar;. and they counseilled hym of that was\nnedefu&llbar; to be doo.  Thanne retourned the kinge vnto\nthe halle, where he made to be commanded by hym,\nthat none there, on peyne of deth, should be so hardy\nto spek ony word but \u00feat he were commanded.  The\nkinge thenne spak & said, 'now, fayre lordes, ye muste\nvnderstand how this quare&llbar; is now not litel, for it is\nfor lyf or grete dyshonour for euermore to the one partye. and wete it for certayn that I ne owe ne also\nwyl not refuse ryght to be doo in my Court.  Olyuier,'\nsaid the king, 'wil you deffende your fader of this\ntreson?'  'Sire,' said he / 'ye certaynly,' /. and thenne\nthe king ansuerd / 'the lystes ben alredy dressed, and\ntherfore I ordeyne the batai&llbar; to be to morow exploited.\nAnd wete it / that yf ye be dyscomfited & ouercome,\nbothe your fader and ye shul be hanged. and not lesse\nshal haue your partye aduerse, yf the cas myshappeth\nto hym.  Make you thanne redy toward / and gyue in\noure hand hostages & pledges / and first your fader\nsha&llbar; abyde.' and thenne the king made Josselin to be\nledde in to pryson in a stronge toure. and thanne said\nthe king to Raymondin, 'Sire knight, whome shul ye\ngyue vs for hostage?'  Alayn and his two sones came\nthanne fourth & said, 'sire, we pledge hym.'  'By my\nfeyth,' said the king, 'it suffyseth vs wel. and therfore\nye sha&llbar; not hold pryson.  For wel I wote that the\nknight had not emprysed the batai&llbar; without he wold\nperfourme it.'  And thus departed bothe parties fro the\npresence of the kinge. and Raymondyn with hys folk,\nacompanyed of hys vncle & Cousins, yede toward his\npauillons, and aboute euen tyme he went in to the\nchirch Cathedra&llbar;, and there he watched, making hys\nprayers to god with grete deuocyon / And Olyuer also\ncame to hys hous with grete foyson of them of hys\nlynee, and made his hors & harneys redy.  On the\nmorowe they herd masse, and after armed them / and\nthe king and the Barons of the land were sette on the\nscafoldes rounde aboute the listes / and gardes to the\nchamp or feld were ordeyned, and the Chayers sette.\nAnd about the ooure of pryme came Raymondin with\nfayre felawship, armed moche goodly & richely / the\nspere on the rest, and on hym hys cote of armes,\nbrowded with syluer & azure / and entred the lystes\nvpon a grete destrier wel harneysed vnto the nayle of the foot / as for gage of bataille / and there he made\nreuerence & salewed the king & the Barons.  'By my\nfeith,' said eueryone / 'it is long syn we sawe so fayre\nman of armes ne of so fayr contenaunce / he hath not\nbeste werke that hath suc&hbar; a man in hand to jouste\nor fyght with hym.'  Thenne descended Raymondin\nfro the destrer as appertly as he had be vnarmed, and\nsette hym in the chayer abydyng after his\naduersary.  It is trouth that long after that came Olyuer, right\nwel & nobly armed, and sett on a moche ryche\ndestrier / and wel he semed man of grete fayttes / and\nso was he / & before hym came Josselin, his fader, on\na palfray, and made reuerence to the kinge & hys\nbarons.  Moche semed Josselin abasshed as thanne /\nFor that euery man said he had euyl cause.  What\nshuld I make long tale / the holy Euangiles were there\nbrought, wheron Raymondin swore that Josselyn had\neuyl cause, and that he had doon the treson as he had\nbyfore declared / and after he kneled & kyssed the\nbook, and sette hym self ayen on the chayere.  And\nafter Josselin sware, but he stakered, and so timerous\nhe was that he coude not touche the boke / and also\nOlyuer, whic&hbar; knew wel the trouth of a&llbar;, swore fu&llbar;\nfeyntly / and that doon he sette hym self agayn in his\nchayere.  and fourthwith a herault cryded with an high\nvoyce on the kingis byhalfe / that none, on peyne of\ndeth, shuld be so hardy to speke ony worde ne to make\neny signe or tokon that eny of the Champyons might\nvnderstand or perceyue.  And thenne eueryman voyded\nthe place, saaf only they that were stablisshed to the\ngarde of the champ & Josselin.  And anoone\nRaymondyn lepte on horsbak moc&hbar; appertly and toke hys\nspere, and on the other syde Olyuer had hys destrier\nredy, and lept on lightly, and toke hys spere with\nsharp yron / and thenne cryded a herault thryes.  'lete\nranne your horses & doo your deuoyre.' Here saith the veray hystory, that whan the cry\nwas made Raymondin had leyed the ende of\nhys spere to the grounde alonge the hors nek, and\nthryes he made the signe of the crosse.  and while he\ndede so hys enemy ranne at hym, and with hys spere\nhytte Raymondin on the brest or he was ware of hit\nmoche rudely, For dooyng so he putte to it alle his\nstrengthe & myght, but Raymondin bowed neuer\ntherfore / and the spere of Olyuer brak in to pieces,\nand with that strok the speere of Raymondyn fell to\nthe ground.  'Ha, traytour,' said then Raymondyn /\n'thou folowest wel the right euyl lynee of whiche thou\nyssued.  but that may not auaylle the.' and toke the\nsterope that hynge at sadelbowe, that had thre poyntes\nwel assured, eche of them seuen enc&hbar; long.  and at\nretourne that Olyuer supposed to haue doo,\nRaymondyn smote hym on the helmet with the sterop that oo\npoynte of it entred & perced the helmet so that the\nnayl of the vmbrel brake, and the vysere hing at oo\nsyde / and the visage of Olyuyer abode a&llbar; dyscouered,\nwherfore he was moche agast and\nabasshed.  Neuertheles he drew out hys swerde & wel shewed contenaunce\nof a knight that lytil redoubteth hys enemye.  and so\nthey faught long space togidre and gaaf eche other\ngrete strokes / and there might men see grete appertyse\nof armes.  At last Raymondin alighted on foot and\ntoke vp hys spere that laye at ground & came with\ngrete paas toward his foo morta&llbar;, whiche the best wyse\nthat he coude dystourned fro Raymondin that he made\nto goo after hym alonge the Champ.  For he dide with\nhys hors what he wold, and by that manere dooyng\nhe supposed to haue made Raymondyn wery that nedes\nhe muste reste hym, and so the day shuld be soone\npassed.  But Raymondin whiche that perceyued, yede &\nappertly to[ke] hys hors that he ledde with one hand, & toke the spere at other hand / and softly one pas after\nanother came towarde hys enemye.  And whan Olyuyer\nsawe hym come, perceyuying his manere he wist\nnot how ne in what manere Raymondyn wold assay&llbar;\nhym / and sodaynly spored his horse, wenyng to haue\ncome & hurted Raymondyn as he had doon\nbyfore.  but Raymondin kyst at hym yet ayen the sterop by\ngrete anger, and hitte Olyuyer hors at foreheed with\nsuche strength that the chaunfreyn entred deep within\nthe hors heed, so that it bowed the legges behind to\ntherthe.  Olyuyer thanne sporid his destrier, but as\nthe hors redressed hym, Raymondyn with hys spere\nsmote Olyuyer at right syde of hym, so that he\nouerthrew hym to therthe, and so wonderly a strok he gaf\nhym betwix the may&llbar; panser & the Corset that the\nspere heed entred deep in hys body / and ar he might\nbe delyuered Raymondyn cast on hym so many strokes\nthat he might no more meve hym self, and by force\nplucked the helmet fro the heed of hym, and putte hys\nknee on his naue&llbar;, and the hand senester at hys nek,\nand held hym in suche destresse that by no manere\nwaye he might not meue hym. Thystory telleth in this partye that Raymondin\nheld Olyuyer as aboue is said long espace of\ntyme, and whan he sawe that he had the best ouer\nhym he drew a knife that heng at his right side and\nsaid to hym, 'False traytour, yeld thyself vaynquyssed,\nor ellis thou art but deed.'  'By my feith,' said Olyuyer,\n'I have leuer dye by the hand of suche a valyaunt\nknight as ye be than of another.'  Raymondyn thanne\ntoke grete pite on hym and demanded of hym, vpon\nparel of the sowle of hym / yf he nothing knew of\nthe treson that Josselin his fader had doon / and he\nansuerd nay, and he was not yet borne \u00feat tyme that\nthis treson happed.  and how be it that it plaised to god that Fortune were as thenne contrary to hym,\nnowithstanding yet he held his fader for a trew man /\nlawful and not gilty of that same dede.  And thanne\nwhan Raymondyn, that wel wyst the contrary, herd\nhym, he was sorowful & woo, and bete hym so moche\non the temples with hys fust armed with his gantlet\nthat he made hym so astonyed that he ne saw ne herd\nne wyst what he dide to hym / And thanne stode\nvp Raymondin and toke hym by the feet and drew\nhym vnto the lystes, And syn he putte hym without\nfourth / and retourned & came before the scafold of\nthe kinge, the visere lyfte on hye, & said: 'Sire, haue\nI doo my deuoire, For yf I haue eny thing more to doo\nI am redy to it to the regarde of your Court &\nordynaunce?'  'By my feyth,' said the king, 'sire knight,\nye haue quytted your self full wel.'  And the king\n\u00feenne commanded that Josselin and his sone shuld be\nbothe hanged, and they to whom the king comanded\nthis execucion to be doo wente soone, & without delay\nthey seasid Josselin, who anoone cryed to the king\npiteously for mercy.  And \u00feen the king yede and said\nto hym that he shulde telle the trouthe of the quarell,\nand peradventure he night haue grace. Thenne said Josselin, 'Sire, to hyd the trouth it\nauaylleth not / haue pite on me yf it plaise you,\nFor certaynly it was doon in the manere & fourme as\nthe knight hat purposed & said / and wete it \u00feat my\nsone Olyuyer was not yet borne.'  'By my feith, Josselin,\nsaid the kinge, 'here is grete falshed, and yf it ne had\nbe goddis playsire that ye shuld be therof punysshed,\nhe had not lefte you lyue so long in this world.  and\nas to my part, ye shall not fay&llbar; of the punycyon.'\nThanne he said all on high to them that were ordeyned,\nthat anoone bothe fader & sone shuld be hanged.  And\nthenne came fourth Raymondin & said to the king:\n'Sire, I thanke you as I may of the good justice that ye haue doon to me / but, sire, I moued with pite requyre\nyou of your mysericorde to be shewed on Olyuyer.  For\nseeyng his valyauntyse & worthynes, also consideryng\nthat he is not gilty of the treson it were grete dommage\nof hys deth.  For yet shall he mow doo wel.  And as to\nthe fader, for this that I see hym olde & feble / of my\npart, sire king, yf ye vouchesauf to graunt hym grace\ntherof I shuld be fayn & glad, soo that I haue myn\nherytage to my behouf, and that the prouffytes &\nfruytes that he hath leuyed & receyued of it, syn he\nhad therytage in hys handes, be by extimacion reualued\nin money.  that same payment to be by you, sire king,\nordeyned to edefye or bigge a pryorye, & monkes\ntherin to be rented with reuenues & possessyons after\nthe quantyte of the said money to \u00fee regarde of you\nand of your Counseill. the said monkes to pray for the\nsowle of the kinges nevew perpetuelly.'  The kinge\nthanne said to his barons, 'Fayr Sires, here ye may\nsee the free courage of a knight that prayeth to me to\nrespyte hys enemys fro deth. but by the feyth that I\nowe to god Josselin nor his sone shal neuer doo treson\nne cause no man to goo out of my land as exiled.' and\nfourthwith he made them to be hanged, and rendred to\nRaymondin his enherytaunce and al Josselyn's land\nwith a&llbar;.  Wherof Raymondin thanked hym moche\nhumbly and made to hym his homage.  After byganne\nthe feste to be moche grete, and held the king grete &\nnoble Court open to al men, & was moche glad of that\nhe had recouered & goten so noble a knight in his\nland.  but for nought he made joye, For soone ynoughe\nhe shall see that Raymondyn had no grete wylle to\nabyde and dwelle in Bretayne, for moc&hbar; longed to hym\nthe sight of Melusyne. Now in this parte telleth thystorye that Raymondyn\nwas moche wel festyed of the king of the brut\nBretayne that held grete & honourable Court for loue of Raymondin, and the barons of Bretayne made grete\njoye for his commyng, and specyally his vncle Alayn\nand hys two children, & they of his lynage.  And\nthanne came Raymondin to the king and said to\nhym thus: 'Sire king, I pray you & beseche that ye\nvouchsaf of graunte & acorde that I gyue the Baronye\nof Leon that was to Henry my fader, on whos sowle\ngod haue mercy, to Henry my Cousyn / and so the\nland shal bere the name of his ryghtfu&llbar; lord / and\nyou the name of your liege man, For he is of the\nright lynee.'  'By my feyth,' sayd \u00fee kinge, 'sire, sith\nit playseth you thus wel it pleseth vs so to be.'  Thenne\nthe kyng called Henry, For he loued hym wel and said\nto hym: 'Henry, receyue the name of the baronye of\nLeon, whic&hbar; your Cousyn gyue you, and make homage\nto me therof' / and so he dide and thanked moche the\nking & Raymondyn. And this doon Raymondin\ncalled to hym Alayn his Cousyn: 'I gyue you the\nland that the king hath gyuen me that late was\nlongyng to Josselin Dupont, and make your homage to\nthe king': / and he thanked hym moche humbly and\nknelyng made hys homage to the kinge that moche\njoyfully receyued hym to it.  But the Barons of the\nland byganne thanne to make rumour among them and\nsaid: 'By my feyth, this knight is not come into this\nlande for couetyse ne auarice.  But only he hath putte\nhis lyf in grete auenture & parel for to conquere his\nheritage.  Whan so soone he demysed hymself\ntherof. it muste wel be that grete ryches he hath some where' /\nThanne came thauncyent knight to Raymondin.  and\nwhan Raymondin sawe hym he said to hym that he\nshuld delyuere hym self of that his lady had\ncommanded hym / and he ansuerd, 'my lord, therfore\nI am come toward you.' and thanne he presented\nfro hys lady to the kyng  a grete Coupe of gold sette\nwith many precyous stone. and after gaf to a&llbar; the Barons in the forsaid name many ryche\njewelles.  Wherof a&llbar; were meruaylled of whens might come\nsuch a riches / and a&llbar; they said that Raymondin\nmuste be moche riche & mighty in some other\nCountree.  Wherfore the feest was greter than afore.  And\nAlayn and his two sones demened suche joye that\nnone shuld mow think it.  but yet duryng theire joye\nwas on other syde made grete sorow of the parents\n& frendes of Josselin that had not forgeten \u00fee deth of\nhym / as herafter ye shal here reherce. And here\nresteth thystorye to speke of this feste & folowyng\nthe matere saith how Melusyne gouerned her self while\nthat Raymondyn was in his vyage. Thystory telleth vs that whiles Raymondyn was in\nbretayne, Melusyne made to be byld up the\ntoune of Lusynen, and walled it with strong walles &\ntoures one nygh another, and deep diches dide doo\nmake about it.  A toure she dide to be made betwixt\nthe Fortresse & the tounne walled with a wa&llbar; of xx\nfoot thikk.  This toure was ouer hye / and ordeyned\nmen that shuld be styl both day & nyght, at leste one\nvpon the vpermost batelments of it with a trompe in\nhis hand, that shuld blow at euery tyme he perceyued\n& sawe men othre on foot or on horsbak togidre aboue\nthe nombre of xx ti commyng toward the said toune\nor Castel / and that same toure she called the tromped\ntoure.  Now retourneth thistory to spek of the kyng\n& of Raymondin, and of the feest & chere that euery\none made to Raymondin. IN this partye reherceth thystorye that moc&hbar; was\nthe feest grete at Nantes and the king honoured\nmoche Raymondin, and there jousted gentilmen one\nayenst other byfore the ladyes & gentyl wemen wher\nRaymondin bare hym fu&llbar; valiauntly & goodly that\neuery man spak wele of hym, sayeng that he was worthy to be lord of a grete land.  And moche were\nthey abasshed of the grete riches that they sawe euery\nday about Raymondin / but who someuer made feest\nfor Raymondyn, the Chastelayn of Arua&llbar;, that was\nneuew to Josselin Dupont, made a&llbar; the contrary.  For\nhe sodaynly sent to alle the parentes frendes and\naffyns of Josselin, letyng them to knowe how it was\nof theire frend Josselyn, and that they shuld be at a\ncertayn day that he assigned to them at a certayn\nretrette that was within the forest of Guerrende that\nwas of his owne.  And whan they vnderstode the\ndeth of Josselin \u00feey were sorowfu&llbar; & woo, and\nassembled them togider about ii C men of armes, and\npryuely yede & came to the said retrette, where the said\nChastelayn had manded them to come.  And thanne\nthe Chastelayn in the moost secrete wyse that he coude,\ndeparted fro the kinges court without leue of the king\nne of the Barons / but there he lefte thre squyers of\nhis for to loke & aspye whiche waye Raymondin shuld\ntake, and that they shuld anounce it to hym to the\nretrette beforsaid.  So long rode the Castelleyn that\nhe cam to the retrette where he found them of his\nlynage, and he reherced to \u00feem a&llbar; the manere of\nthaduenture / and how Josselin & his sone were\nhanged / and asked of them what they thoughte &\nproposed to doo / yf they shuld auenge them on\nRaymondin that was causer of it / and to them grete\nblame & shame for euermore was bycause of hym\nimputed / or elles to lete hym goo free.  Thenne\nansuered for al the lynage an vnwyse & hasty knight\nthat was sone to the Cousyn of Josselin.  'cousyn\ncastellayne, we wol that ye wete & knowe that thus\nshal nat this oultrageous werk be lefte.  For we alle\nof one accorde & wylle wil putte hym to deth that\nto vs hath doo suche vitupere & dyshonour.'  'By\nmy feith,' said thanne the Castellayne, 'I hold & repute the wele & honour wel employed that Josselin dide to\nyou in tyme passed.  And anoone I shall putte you in\nthe way and place where we shal wel acomplisshe our\nwylle on hym that suche shame hath doon to vs.  For\nby what someuer side he yssueth out of Bretayne he\nmay not scape fro vs.  For therto we haue good\nwayters, & espyes that soone sha&llbar; anounce his way\nto vs whan tyme shalbe.'  And they ansuerd alle with\nan voys /--'Blessed be you. and wete it that\nwhatsomeuer fa&llbar; therof / this enterpryse shalbe brought to an\nend, and we shal slee that false knight that hath\nimposed to vs alle vylonnye & shame.'  And here speke\u00fe\nno more thistorye of them, and retourneth to spek of\nthe king & Raymondyn. and how he departed fro\nthe king moch honorably. Thystory saith that the feest dured wel xv dayes &\nmore. the king of Bretons & hys baronye made\ngrete honour to Raymondyn in so moche that I can\nnat reherce it.  Raymondin thanne toke leue of the\nking & of his Barons and humbly mercyed the king\nof his good justice that he had doon to hym in his\nnoble Court, and departed fro them moche\nhonourably.  And wete it that bothe the king & many his\nbarons were sory for his departing.  And thus\nRaymondyn acompanyed of his vncle Alayn his two sones\n& all theyre meyne rode toward Leon.  But it is\ntrouth that \u00feauncyent knight was departed & goon\nbyfore / and had doo sette vp bothe tentes & pauillons\nand a&llbar; other thinges necessary he ordeyned & made\nredy.  And thanne Raymondin / hys vncle with his\ntwo sones and the moost nere of his kynne to hym\nlodged them togidre in the Castel.  and the other\nherberowed them in the toune.  Whan the peple of\nthe Countre knew the commyng of theyre owne lordes\nsone they were joyfu&llbar; & glad, and made to hym many\nfayr presentes after the vse & custome of the Countre / as of wyn, of bothe flesh & fysshe, hey & ootys, and of\nmany other thinges, and they were fayn & glad sith it\nplaysed not Raymondin to abyde & hold the land, that\nthey were befa&llbar; in the sayd lynee of theire lord, and\nthat they were quytte & exempted fro the subgection\n& boundage of the lynee of Jossellin.  Raymondin\nthanne \u00feanked them curtoysly of theire presentes &\nyeftes. commanded & prayed them that they wold be\ntrue & feythfu&llbar; subgets to Henry hys Cousin to whom\nhe had gyue the land. and they ansuered that \u00feey\nshuld doo soo.  Of them resteth thistorye, and speketh\nof the spyes that wayted there / of whic&hbar; one went to\nthe retrette where the Castellayne of Arua&llbar; \u00b7 and the\nlynee of Josselin were a&llbar; redy / and the two other spyes\nabode for to knowe what way Raymondyn shuld hold \u00b7 IN this partye telleth to vs thistory that Raymondin\ndeparted fro Leon, and toke leue of al hys parents\n& frendes there, & went to Quyngant where the feste\nwas grete, and there after the feeste was ended\nRaymondyn wold haue take leue of hys vncle Alayn & of\nall his lynage / but they dide putte the moost remedy\nthey coude for to hold hym there a seuene nyght\nmore.  Wherfore Raymondyn obtempering to them / ye /\nayenst his entent & courage fullfylled theire\nwilles.  And in the meane while came to Henry hys Cousyn, a\nman that told hym that as he passed fourth by the said\nretrette where the Castellayne of Arua&llbar; was with wel\ntwo houndred men in armes, that they abode for some\nfolke to whom they owed no good wylle. but he told\nhym not whom they aspyed & watched for.  And\nwhan Henry understode this he toke a squyer of his\nand bad hym goo thither & knowe what it was. and he\nthat was moche dilygent dyde so that he knew the\nmoost parte of theyre purpos and entent & what\nnombre \u00feey were.  Soone after he retourned to Henry\nand reherced to hym all that he had found, and that they were wel fyue of six houndred fighting\nmen.  And this tydinges herd / Henry deffendid to the\nmessanger moche expresly that to no body he shuld\nspek of it.  And soone he called his brother Alayn\nand some other of the moost noble of hys lynage and\nreherced to them alle this werk.  'By my feyth,' said\nthey, 'we ne cannot thinke what they entende to doo,\nbut that they wold auenge them on Raymondin our\nCousyn or ellis to meve werre ayenst vs for the said\nquarelle.  but alwayes it is good to be purueyed of\nremedye \u00b7 lete vs therfore send for alle our frendes and\nkepe vs secretly togidre tyl we see what they haue\npurposed to doo / to thende yf they come on vs that\nthey fynde vs not discouered & vnpurueyed \u00b7 also yf\nRaymondin departeth that he be not surprysed of\nthem / and yf they entende to doo hym euyl / it is\nbut for to take the lyf fro hym.'  'By my feyth,' said\nthe other, 'that is trouth.  Now lete vs hye & delyuere\nvs that our mandement be doo of light & secretly.'\nAnd so did they / in so moche that within the second\nday after / they were gadred togidre about foure\nhoundred in nombre men of armes what of theyre lynee\nand what of theire affynyte & alyed / & made them\nto be lodged in a wod so that few men knew of it.  It\nhapped thanne that Raymondyn wold no lenger abyde /\nand toke leue of Alayn hys vncle \u00feat abode styl at\nQuyngant moche woofu&llbar; & sory of hys departyng /\nand hys two sones companyed hym & conueyed with\ngrete foyson of theyre lynee.  And neuer wold lete\nhym goo byfore, but made theyre men to be on eche\nside of hym, and so long they rode that they approched\nthe Forest where the Castellayne and his felawship\nwere in his retrette which Castellayn knew by his\nspyes the commyng of Raymondyn & his men and\ntold it to hys parents sayeng in this maner: 'Now shal\nbe seen & knowen who euer loued Josselin and Olyuer hys sone.  For here we may putte to deth alle the\nlynage of hym self \u00feat to vs hath doon suche a shame.'\nAnd they ansuered to hym that none shuld scape, but\nalle shuld be putte to deth.  But as the prouerbe saith,\n'Such weneth to auenge his shame that encreassith it' /\nand so it was of the Castellayne & hys parents.  In this\nmeane while came \u00feauncyent knight to Raymondin\nand said to hym in this manere:  'Sire, ye myster wel\nfor to be armed gooyng thrugh the Forest.  For the\nlynage of Josselin that ye haue dystroyed loueth you\nnot, and they might bere bothe to your personne and\nto your felawship & meyne grete dommage yf they\nfound you vnpurueyed / and my herte gyueth me that\nsoone we sha&llbar; fynd hem' / and Henry & Alayn his\nbrother and a&llbar; theire lynage were armed all redy, and\nhad sent a&llbar; theire meyne byfore to make embushe\nwithin half a mylle fro the retrette.  Thenne whan\nRaymondyn / had commanded hys men to take theire\narmures on hem & sawe them of his lynage that were\nalle armed, he ne wyst what say but \u00fee two brethern\nhis cousyns told hym how they had sent in embusshe\nbyfore wel iiii. C. of their men for to kepe hym fro hys\nenemyes / and they reherced to hym a&llbar; the\ntrouthe.  'By my feyth,' said Raymondin, 'curtoyse oweth not to\nbe forgeten / and for it shal not as to my parte fro hens\nfourthon.  For yf in tyme to come ye haue nede of\nme / I am he that shal at al tymes be redy after my\npower to fulfylle your wille.'  And so longe they rode\nthat they entred the Forest /. Thystorye saith that the Castellayne was in his\nretrette and abode for the spye that last he\nhad sent to wete whan Raymondyn shuld entre the\nForest.  the whiche exploited so that he came nigh\nRaymondin / and thanne he lightly retourned toward the retrette and to the Castellayn he said: 'Sire, ye\nmay see hym come yonder.'  And whan the Castellayn\nvnderstod hym he bygan to crye with a hye voys /\n'on horsbak, & who that euer loued Josselin & his sone\nlete hym folowe me.'  Thanne styed euery man on\nhorsbak / & they were so encressyd in nombre that\nthey were wel viii C & moo fighting men, and rode\nfourth in ordynaunce ayenst Raymondin, and passed\nby the embusshe that Henry and his parents had\nsent. whiche lete them passe fourth without they discouered\nthemself. and soone after \u00feey rode after them.  So\nlonge rode the Castelayn & his folke that they\nperceyued nygh them \u00fee foreward of Raymondin. but\nabasshed he was whan he sawe them armed gooyng\nby ordynaunce / though they were but a few seruaunts\nand a C. men of armes / they escryed them to the deth /\nAnd whan they vnderstode it they yede apart & made\nto blowe theire trompettes and ranne vpon Raymondyns\nfolke whiche were sore dommaged or he coude come\nto helpe them, the whiche rode as fast as the hors\nmight walope, and hauyng the spere on the rest\nlaunched among his enemyes / and the first that he\nencountred he ouerthrew hym doun to therthe & aftir\ndrew out high [his] swerde and smote trauersing here\n& there and in a lytel tyme he moche dommaged hys\nenmyes.  But whan the Castellayn saw hym he was\nfu&llbar; woo & sory / and he shewed hym to thre hys\nCousyns sayeng / 'loke yonder is the knyght that\nhath shamed a&llbar; our lynage / yf we had our wylle of\nhym a&llbar; the other shuld be soone ouercome &\nvaynquysshed.' thanne \u00feey spoored theire horses, and a&llbar;\nfoure ranne ayenst hym / and with theire speeris\nrecountred hym, soo that they ouer threw bothe man & hors to the erthe and passed al foure fourth.  But\nwhan Raymondyn saw hym ouer thrawen he spooryd\nhys hors, and the hors that was swyft and strong\nreleuyd hym on hys knees and soo fourth on his feet\nso pertly \u00feat Raymondyn neuer lost sterop fro the\nfoot ne swerd fro the hand.  And thanne he tourned\ntoward the Chastellayn & so mightily smote hym on\nthe helmet with hys swerd that he so stakerid that he\nlost bothe steropes / and as Raymondyn passed by\nhym he hurtelyd hym soo with the sholder that he\nfe&llbar; doune to the erthe / and the pres came there so\ngrete that he was sore tradde with hors feet.  Thenne\nbegane the bataill grete & fe&llbar; and sore dommaged\nwere bothe partes.  And thanne came there also\nthauncyent knight and Henry & Alayn hys brother,\nand foughte strongly ayenst theyre enemyes.  There\nRaymondin made grete fayttes of armes and sore\ndommaged hys enemys. but the Chastelayn was had\nout of the pres and hys men toke hym another\nhors.  Thanne toke the party aduerse, herte & courage &\nstoutly fought they ayenst Raymondyn & his\nfolke. and there were many one slayn of both sydes.  And\nwete it that Raymondyn & his folke susteyned heuy\nweyght.  For hys aduerse party was moc&hbar; strong &\nmoche wel they fought & valyauntly. but the\nembusshe of Henry came by the bake syde on them and\nassaylled them on a&llbar; sydes so that \u00feey wyst not\nwhat they shuld doo / how they shuld defende them\nself nor where they shuld flee / Thenne was the\nChastellayn taken & brought before Raymondin / and\nhe commanded thauncient knight to kepe hym.  And\nin conclusion a&llbar; the other were soone after outhre\ntake or deed.  And this doon they came to the retrette\nwhere Raymondyn said to hys parents: 'Now lordes\nI owe wel to loue and thanke you of the grete\nsocoure that ye haue doon to me this day.  For certaynly I wote that yf it had not be the help of\ngod and of you this traytour had putte me to deth by\ntreson, now haue regarde what best is for to\ndoo.'  'Sire,' said Henry, 'as your wyl sha&llbar; graunte we alle\nassent therto.'  'I sha&llbar; saye you,' said Raymondin,\n'what we shal doo. lete vs take and assemble a&llbar; the\nlynee of Josselin to-gidre / and bothe the Chastellayn\nand alle the other his parents we sha&llbar; sende to the\nkinge.  Whiche hauyng regarde to theire grete falshed\nand treson shal punysshe aftir his good wylle.'  Alle\nother thanne said / 'forsouthe, sire, ye say wel.'  Thenne\nwere chosen out a&llbar; the prysonners that were not of\nthe lynage of Josselin. and att yate of the said retrette\nsome were hanged / some at wyndowes & some at\nbatelments of it.  And the Chastellayn and alle his\nparents there were bounde bothe hand & feet as\ntraytours and prysonners. the whiche Alayn\nacompanyed with thre houndred spere men lede them toard\nthe kinge. and first Alayn presented to \u00fee kinge the\nChastelayne of Arua&llbar; as he that had conspired &\nmachined that treson / and al other after. and to hym\nreherced Alayn a&llbar; how it was happed. and how\nRaymondyn recommanded hym to his good grace / and\nthat he wold not be dysplaysed yf he had take\nvengeaunce on hys mortal enmyes that wend to haue\nmurdred hym with treson, and that he sent to hym the\nChastellayn chief causer and other his complices for to\nknowe by them the trouth of the faytte and for to\npunysshe them at his plaisure and wylle / 'And how,\nChastellayn,' said the kinge 'haue ye be so hardy to doo\nsuche treson and so shamefu&llbar; dede for the raisonnable\njustice that late we dide in our reaume / seeing & also\nconsidering the grete treson that Josselin your vncle\nknowleched & confessed to haue doo?'  'By god,' said\nthe king, 'ye were therof surquydous, & it is wel right yf euyl is comme to you therof.'  'Ha, noble kinge,'\nsaid thanne the chasteleyn, 'for your pite lete falle\nyour mysericorde on me caytyue personne.  For the\ngrete sorowe & woo that I had of the dyshonour that\nRaymondin had doon to our lynage hath caused me\nto doo soo.' 'By my feith,' said the king,'it is euyl companye of\na traytour / and good it is to shette the stable\nbefore the hors be lost, wel I wyl that ye knowe that\nneuer ye shall haue suche purpos as to wyl slee no\ngentylman with treson, For neuer I sha&llbar; ete tyl that ye\nbe hanged with your vncle, for ye sha&llbar; hold hym\nfelawship, and also a&llbar; them that are of your\ncohortacion.'  The kinge made to be take a&llbar;e them of hys cohorte of\ncompany, and were a&llbar; hanged / and the Chastelayn he\nsent to Nantes, and there he was hanged nyghe to his\nvncle Josselin & Olyuyer hys Cousyn.  And thus kepte\nwel the king of Bretons Justice in his time regnyng in\nBreytayne. Here sayth thistory that whan Alayn was retourned\nto Raymondin unto the retrette, and that he\nhadd to hym and to the other reherced this \u00feat the\nkyng had doon / they said that the kyng had doo right\nwel as a valyaunt & lawfu&llbar; justiser shuld doo.  Thenne\ncalled Raymondyn to hym Henry Alayn & other of his\nlynee and said to them in this manere: 'Fayre cousyns\n& good frendes, I enyoyne & charge you that ye doo\nedefye or bigge a pryorye with viii monkes, and that\nye reueste them with rentes and reuenues such that\nhonestly & goodly they may lyue on for euermore /\nthey to pray there for the sowle of my fader / for the\nkingis nevew sowle and for the sowle of them that are\nslayn & ded in this quare&llbar;.'  And they alle said \u00b7 they\nshuld soo doo.  And Raymondyn prayed them to\nrecommande hym to the kingis good grace to hys\nbarons and to Alayn their fader.  And thanne he toke leue of them / and they were sorowfu&llbar; of theire\ndepartement / and also of this that he wold nat lete\nthem goo no ferther with hym.  They retourned to\nQuyngant.  And Raymondin yede on his way and\ncam to guerrende \u00b7and wel he was there festyed and\nworshipfully cheryed of them of the toune.  And here\nresteth thistorye of Raymondyn \u00b7 and sha&llbar; recounte\nhow Henry & Alayn toke leue of theyre lynee and cam\nayen to theyre fader. Thistorye saith in this paas that Henry and Alayn\ntoke leue of theyre lynage & came to theire\nfader and recounted to hym a&llbar; thaduenture of the\nChastellayn, how they were departed fro \u00feeyr cousyn,\nand how he hadd commanded & charged them to\nfownde a pryory.  'By my feith,' said \u00feeire fader.  'Alayn,\nnow is the land wel clene delyuered of the lynage of\nJosselin; god on theyre sowles haue mercy, how be it\nthey loued vs neuer.  Now fayre sones I sha&llbar; saye\nyou what ye shal doo.  First ye shal goo to the kinge\n& requyre hym that it plese hym to gyue you a place\nfor to edefye the Pryorye / and telle hym the maner\nhow ye be commanded of your Cousyn to fownde\nit.  and I byleue he shal gyue you a good ansuer.'  And\nthey said that thus shuld they doo.  And thanne they\ndeparted fro theire fader, and so long they rode that\nthey camme to Vannes and founde the kinge departed\n& was goon to Sassymon for to dysporte hym at\nChasse.  And they mounted on horsbak and came to\nthe gate and passed & entred the Forest and rode so\nlong tyl they came to the Castel. and founde the kyng\ngoon to the park to the chasse / and the two brethren\nyed after & founde the king nyghe a grete tree by a\nstaung where he abode aftir the herte that houndes\nchassed.  Thenne the two bretheren drew them self aparte\nbycause they wold not lette the kyng to see the dysporte /\nwho perceyued them wel & coude them good thanke therfore.  and not long after \u00fee herte came that ranne\nin to the staung / and there he was take by chaas of\ndogges. / and was hadd out of the watre / and the\ncuree made & gyue to the houndes as custome is to\ndoo.  Thenne Henry and Alayn his brother drew them\nself byfore the king and salewed hym moche\nhonourably / and made wel theire message as theyre Cousin\nhad charged them.  And the king welcommed hem &\nmoche enquyred of them thestate of Raymondin and\nthey told hym alle that they had seen of hit / and\nafter they recounted to hym how he enjoyned & charged\nthem to edyfye & make vp a Priorye of eyghte\nmonkes.  them to reueste & empossesse with landis, reuenues &\nrents, they to syng & pray therfore for the sowle of the\nkingis nevew / for Henry his faders sowle, and for the\nsowles of alle them that had receyued deth in this\nquarelle.  Also how at hys instaunce they shuld pray\nhym for a place where they shuld edefye the said\npryorye.  'By my feith,' said the king. 'the requeste\nis wel lawfull & raysonable. and euen now I shall\nlede you to the place where I wyl that it be fownded\nand made vp.'  Thanne they came out of the wareyne\nand came a&llbar; by the walle to thende of the clos. and\nthenne said the king: 'Fair lordes, make here to be\nedyfyed a Pryory & take asmoche of grounde as ye\nlyketh / and I gyue liberte & habaundonne you the\nforest for to cutte there the wode.  and whan the\nmonkes shal be stablysshed there, I enlyberte &\nhabaundonne it to them for theire vse and to alle\nthider commyng & dwelling.  And I graunte to them\nthe fysshing in the see that is nygh to this place a\nquarter of a legge, and to take in the Forest birdes. &\nwild beestes for theire lyuyng & sustenaunce of theire\nhoushold \u00b7 and also I gyue to them all the landes erable\nthat are her about half a legge' / and of alle this he\nmade & gaf to them good & suffisaunt patents. and of all these graunts & gestes the two brethern thanked\nthe king moche humbly whiche made massons,\ncarpenters, & other, to come, and in short tyme they made\nthe chirche & the priorye. and there they stablysshed\nwhyte monkes. vnto the nombre of VIII. religious\npersonnes, the whic&hbar; bere on theire vtterist habyte a\ncrosse of Azure / and enpossessed them wel for theire\nsustenaunce & cotidiane lyuyng / as now yet is.  And\nnow resteth thystorye to spek of the king of Bretons\nand of the two bretheren. and retourneth to recounte\nhow Raymondin gouerned hym self syn after. Now telleth thystorye that so long abode\nRaymondin in the land of Guerrende that he peased\nand acorded togidre two barons of the lande that long\nbyfore hated eche other to deth.  In so moche that he\nmade them to be good frendes togidre, and theire\nCountrees in peas and rest.  And after he toke his leue\nof the barons & of the peuple, which sorowed moche\nfor his departing. and so long he rode that he came\ninto the land of Poytou, wher he found many grete\nforests vnhabyted / and in some places he sawe many\nwyld bestes, as hertes, hyn&dtail;, & roo, wyld bores, and\nother beestes ynough. and in other places many fayre\nplaynes & champaynes. many fayre medowes &\nryuers.  'By my feyth,' said thanne Raymondin, 'it is grete pyte\n& dommage that suche a commodyouse Countre is nat\nenhabyted with peuple.' and many a fayre manoyr and\nplaces were on the ryueres there that soone might be\nredressed as hym semed whiche had be ouerthrawen in\ntyme of warre.  And thus rydyng fourth he came to\nan auncyent Abbey called Maylleses, and therein were\ncomprised thabbot and an houndred monkkis, beside\nthe Convers. and there herberowed Raymondyn for the\ngrete playsaunce that he toke of it. and \u00feer he dwelled\nthre dayes and thre nightes. and gaf to the chirc&hbar;\nthere many fayre jewelles.  After he departed and came rydyng tyl he aprouched & came nygh\nLusynen.  and first he perceyued & sawe the tromped\ntoure and the new toune, and thenne he supposed not\nto be there as he was.  For he knew not the place for\ncause of the said toure & toune new made of late, and\nmoche he meruaylled whan he herd the sowne of the\ntrompes within the toure /. In this part saith to vs thystorye that whan\nRaymondin came aboue Lusynen, & he perceyued\nthe toune walled round aboute with strong walles and\nfortifyed with deep dyches & grete.  'how,' said he to\nthauncyent knight, 'What may this be; mesemed\nright now that I was forwayed of my way to come to\nlusygnen / and yet me semeth soo?'  thenne began\nthauncyent knight to lawhe.  And Raymondin said\nto hym: 'How, sir knight, jape you with me / I telle\nyou for certayn yf it were not the toure and the toune\nthat I see I shuld haue wend to be this nyght in\nLusygnen.'  'By my feyth,' said thauncient knight,\n'soone ye shal fynde yourself there yf god wyl with\ngrete joye.'  Now I sha&llbar; sey you some of Raymondyn's\nseruaunts were sent before by thauncyent knight to\nanounce Melusyne the commyng of Raymondin. and\nhow be it she byleued them wel / she made no\nsemblaunt \u00feerof / but soone she caused the peuple to be\nredy for to goo & mete with Raymondyn. and she her\nself, acompanyed with many ladyes & damoyselles,\nyede to mete & welcome hym wel horsed & arayed\nhonorably and rychely.  Thenne Raymondin loked\nfourth byfore hym and sawe the peple commyng fro\nthe valey vpward ayenst hym two & two togidre in\nfayre ordynaunce, wherof he moche meruaylled. and\nwhan they aproched they bygan to crye with a high\nvoys, 'ha, ha, dere lord, welcome may you be.'  And\nthenne Raymondin knew som of them that were comme ayenst hym / and demanded of them, 'Fayre lordes, fro whens come you?'  'My lord,' sayd they, 'we com\nfro lusynen.' 'thenne,' said Raymondin, 'is Lusynen\nferre hens?'  They thanne, seeyng that he mysknewe\nthe place for cause of the new toune & toure / said:\n'My lord, ye be at it, but ye mysknowe the place\nbycause that my lady syn your departyng hath doo\nmade and byld this toun & that high toure.  and\nyonder ye may see her commyng ayenst you.'  Thenne\nwas Raymondin moche abasshed / and said not all\nthat he thoughte.  but when he remembred how she\ndyde doo make the Castel of Lusynen in so short tyme\nhe gaf hym self no meruay&llbar; yf she had doon\nsoo.  Thenne is come to hym Melusyne that honorably\nwelcommed hym, sayeng in this manere: 'My lord, I am\nright fayn & glad of that ye haue so wel wrought\n& doon so honourably in your vyage.  For al thinges\nhaue be reherced to me alredy.'  And Raymondin\nansuerd to her: 'Madame, it is by the grace of god\nand of you.'  And talking togidre of this matere they\nentred Lusynen and alighted.  Ther was the feste\ngrete that lasted eighte dayes, And was there the Erle\nof Forest that said to Raymondin, 'ye be welcome.'\nAnd after the feest they departed fro Lusynen and\ncame to Poytiers toward the Erle that receyued \u00feem\nbenygnely, and demanded of Raymondin where he had\nbe so long.  and he recorded to hym alle his\nauenture.  And shortly to say, the Erle Bertran was therof joyful\n& glad. And that doon, the brethern toke leue of\nhym / and the one yede toward forests, and Raymondin\ntoward his wyf & lady, which thenne was grete with\nchild, and bare her terme / the whic&hbar; expired, she\nmade a fayre child that was her second sone / he was\nsoone baptised and imposed to name Edon, and hadd\nan eere greter without comparyson than that other\nwas / but all hys other membres were replenysshed with beaute, the whic&hbar; Edon had syn to hys wyf the\nErle of Marchis doughtir.  And of hym resteth\nthistorye / and speketh ferthermore of Melusyne & of\nRaymondyn her lord. Thistorye sayth & certifyeth that whan the lady\nhad ended the terme of her childbed, and that\nshe was releuyd / the feste was made grete / and many\nnoble men, ladyes, and damoyselles were there, the\nwhiche, after the feest fu&llbar; honourably toke their leue\n& departed.  And that same tyme the lady Melusyne\nbylded bothe the Castel & toune of Melle.  Also she\ndide doo make Vouant & Mernant.  and after she\nmade the bourgh & toure of saynt Maxence, and bygan\nthe Abbey there.  and moche good she dide to poure\nfolk. The second yere after folowyng she hadd a sone\nthat was named guyon, & [he] was a moche fayre\nchild / but he had an ey higher than that other.  And\nwete it that Melusyne had euer so good nouryces, and\nhad so grete care for her children that they mendid\n& grewe so wel that euery one that saw them\nmeruaylled. And that tyme Melusyne bigged & fownd\nmany a fayre place thrughe the lande of Poytou unto\nthe duchie of Guyenne.  She bilded the Castel and \u00fee\nburgh of Partenay so strong and so fayre without\ncomparyson.  after that she dide doo make \u00fee Toures of\nRochelle & the Castel also, & bygan a part of the\ntoune, and thre leghes thens was a grete toure & bigge,\nwhiche Julius Cesar dide doo make, and men called it\nthe Egles toure, bycause that Julius Cesar bare an Egle\nin hys banere as emperour.  That toure made the lady\nto be walled & fortyfyed round aboute with grete\ntoures machecolyd, and made it to be called the Castel\nEglon.  And afterward she edefyed Pons in Poytou\nand fortyfyed Xaintes that was called at that tyme Lynges / and after she made Tallemounte and\nTallemondois and many other tounes & fortres.  And gate\n& acquyred so moche Raymondin thrugh the polycye\n& good gouernaunce of Melusyne, what in Bretayne,\nwhat in Gascoynne & in Guyenne as in Poytou, that\nno prynce was about hym / but he doubted to dysplaise\nhym. Soone after Melusyne was delyuered of her foureth\nman child, whiche hight Anthony, none fayrer\nwas seen before that tyme.  but in his birth he brought\na token along his chyk, that was the foot of a lyon,\nwherof they that sawe hym wondred, & moche were\nabasshed. Here saith thistorye, that the vijth yere after\nMelusyne bare the fyfte child, of whiche at thende\nof ix monethes she was delyuered, & was named\nraynald.  none fayrer child might men see, but he was\nborne only with one eye / but it was so bright &\nso clere that he sawe the ship thre kennynges ferre ou\nthe sea, that is, one & twenty leghes ferre / and\nlykewyse on erthe, whatsoeuer it was.  That same Anthony\nwas fu&llbar; gracyous & curteys, as ye shal here in thystory\nherafter. Ferthermore saith thistory, that the eight yere\nMelusyne childed the vi.  child, that was a sone,\nand had to name Geffray, Whiche at his birth brought\nin hys mouthe a grete & long toth, that apyered\nwithout an enc&hbar; long & more / and therfore men\nadded to his propre name Geffray with the grete\ntoth.  and he was moc&hbar; grete & hye, and wel formed\n& strong, merueyllously hardy & cruel, In so moche\nthat euery man fered & dradde hym whan he was in\nage / he made in his tyme many wonders & merueylles,\nas heraftir ye shal here in thystorye. Thystorye sayth that the ix th yere after Melusyne\nhad a sone, that was the vij th , & hight\nFroymond, that was fayre ynoughe, but he had on hys\nnose a top of heeris, and in his tyme he was moche\ndeuoute.  and afterward, by thassent of bothe hys\nfader & moder, he was made monke in the abbey of\nMaylleses, of whom ye shall here herafter thystorye. In this part sayth to vs thistorye that Melusyne was\ntwo yere without birth of child, but true it is that\nin the xj th yere she had her x th sone, and was grete\nmerueyllously / and he brought at hys birth thre\neyen, one of the whic&hbar; was in the mydel of his\nforhed.  he was so euyl & so cruel that at the foureth yere of\nhis age he slew two of hys nourryces. THe veray hystory saith that so long norysshed\nMelusyne her children, that Vryan, whiche was\ntheldest & first born, was xviij yere old.  he was grete\nand fayre, & wonderly strong, and made grete appertyse\nin armes, so that euery man & woman had pyte of hys\ndyfformytee; for his vysage was short & large, hys one\neye was red & the other blew, and hys eerys were as\ngrete as the handlynges of a Fan.  and Edon his\nbrother was of xvij yere of age.  and Guyon had of\nyeres xvj, and loued Eche other wel Vryan & Guyon /\nand so pert & swyft they were, that alle thoo that sawe\nthem gaf hemself grete wonder & meruay&llbar;.  they were\nbeloued of all the nobles of the land, & made many\nfaytes & appertyses of armes in Joustes, tournoyeng,\n& in Lystes. It happed that same tyme that two knyghtes of\nPoytou came fro Jherusalem agayn / and recounted\nthere as they passed, how the sawdan of Damask had\nbesieged the king of Cypre in hys Cite of Famagoce, &\nthat he held hym therin in grete dystres.  and \u00feat\nsame kyng ne had to hys heyre but only a doughter,\nwhiche was moche fayre.  and these tydinges were ferfourth brought in the land, that Vryan knew of\nit.  and he thenne said to his brother Guyon: 'By my\nfeith, fayre brother, it were grete almese to socoure that\nkyng ayenst the Paynemys.  We ben al redy eyght\nbretherne.  the land of our fader may not remayne\nwithout heyre, though we were bothe deed.  Wherfore\nwe owe the more to enterprise vyages, and see where\nwe may doo some faytes of armes, to be therwith\nenhaunced in worship & honour.'  'By my feyth,' said\nGuyon, 'ye said trouth.  but what cause you to say\nsoo, seeyng that euer I am redy to doo as ye wyl doo?'\n'Southly,' said Vryan, 'ye say full wel.  Lete we send\nfor the two knightes that be come fro the holy vyage,\nto be ensured of them more playnly of the trouth.'\nthey sent to the two knightes that they wold come &\nspek with them, the whic&hbar; gladly dyde so.  And\nwhan they were come, the two brethern welcommed\n& receyued them goodly.  and aftir they bygan\ntenquyre of them the manere of theire vyage / of the\nvse & maneres of the land where they had be.  and\nthey said to them playn trouth.  'We vnderstand,'\nsaid Vryan, 'that ye haue passed thrugh an yle wher a\nking cristen regneth, which is oppressid ouermoch of\nthe paynemys / & wonder is vs that ye abode nat in\nthe werre with that Cristen kyng, for to help &\ncomforte hym, ye that are so renoumed, Worthy and\nvalyaunt knightes, consyderyng as it semeth to vs that\nalle good cristens are hold & bound to helpe eche\nother specyally ayenst the paynemys.'  To this ansuered\nthe two knightes: 'By my feith, gentil squyer & lord,\nwel we wyl that ye knowe that yf by eny manere we\nmyght haue entred the toune without deth, & saf,\ngladly we had doo so as ye say.  but wel ye wote that\ntwo knyghtes may not susteyne & bere the weight\nayenst wel Lxxx. or houndred thousand paynemys,\nthat thenne had besieged the toune wherin the said king was.  For ye oweth to wete that wel fole is he\nthat fighteth ayenst the wynd, wenyng to make hym\nbe sty&llbar;.' 'By my feyth,' said Vryan, 'your excusacion\nis good & iuste.  but tell me yf men myghty to reyse\n& lede with them a xxij ti or xxv ti thousand men of\narmes, myght doo eny faytte there to help & socoure\nthe sayd kyng?'  Thenne ansuerd one of the knightes:\n'By my feyth, sire, ye / seen & considered that the\nCite is strong, and the kyng within valiaunt, hardy &\nworthy fighter of his personne / and he is acompanyed\nwith many good men of armes, & the toun wel\nvytaylled / and yet ther be many Fortresses where they\nof Rodes come to refresshe themself, of the whiche\nthe kyng & they in the Cite haue grete recomforte /\nand wete it that moche easely & wel they might goo\nthider / and wold to god suche a felawship as ye spek\nof wer redy, and that my felawe & I shuld take\nthaduenture with them.'  'By my feyth,' said thenne\nVryan, 'my brother & I sha&llbar; receyue you, & lede you\nthither, god before, and that shortly.'  And whan they\nvnderstode hym say soo, they were moche glad, sayeng\nthat yf they soo dyde, hit moued them of valyaunt\ncourage & grete noblesse of herte.  Here resteth thistorye\nof these two knightes, and yet ferther speketh of Vryan\n& Guyon.", "20": "Cap. XX. How Vryan & Guyon toke leue of bothe theyre fader & moder, and of the help that they had of \u00feem. In this partye sayth thistorye that Vryan and his\nbrother Guyon cam to Melusyne theire moder,\nand to her said Vryan in this manere: 'Madame, yf\nye vouchesaaf, it were wel tyme that we shuld go\nfourth to our vyage, for to knowe the Countrees ferre\n& straunge, Wherby we may acquyre honour & good renommee in straunge marches, to thend that we lerne\n& vnderstand the dyuerse langages of the world.  Also\nyf Fortune and good auenture wyl be propyce &\nconuenable to vs, we haue wel the wy&llbar; & courage to\nsubdue & conquere Countrees & landes; For we\nconsidere & see that alredy we be eyghte bretheren / and\nare lyke, yf god wyl, to be yet as many moo in tyme\ncommyng.  and to say that your landes & possessions\nwere parted in so many partes for our sustenaunce &\ngouernement / he that shuld enheryte the chyef lyflod\nshuld not be able to kepe no grete houshold, ne to be\nof grete estate, to the Regard of the high blood &\ngrete noblesse that we come of / also consideryng as\nnow your grete estate.  Wherfore as to my brother & I\nmy self, we quytte our parte / expect alonely your\ngood grace, thrugh thayde that ye now sha&llbar; doo to vs\nfor our vyage, yf god wyl gyue vs grace to\nacomplysshe.'  'By my feyth, children,' said thenne Melusyne, 'your\nrequeste is caused of grete worthynes and courageous\nherte, and therfore it oweth not to be refused ne\ngaynsayd.  and vpon this matere I sha&llbar; entreate your\nfaders, For without hys counsey&llbar; I owe not to accorde\nyour requeste.'  Thanne fourthwith came Melusyne to\nRaymondin / and shewed hym the requeste & wy&llbar;\nof theire two sones; the whiche ansuerd & sayd, 'By\nmy feyth, madame, yf it lyke you good they doo soo, I\nassent gladly therto.' 'Sire,' said Melusyne, 'ye say\nwel; and wete it that they shal do no\u00feing in theire\nvyage but that it sha&llbar; tourne to theire grete lawde\n& honour, yf god wyl.'  Then came ayen Melusyne to\nher two sones, and thus she said to them: 'Fayre\nchildren, thinke from hensfourthon to doo wel; For\nyour fader hath graunted youre requeste, & so doo\nI.  and care you not for no \u00feing, For within short tyme\nI shall ordeyne & purveye for your faytte with goddis\ngrace & help / in such wise that ye sha&llbar; konne me good gree & thanke therfore.  but telle me whether &\nto what part of the world ye wyl & purpose to goo, to\nthende I purvey of suche thinges that shalbe necessary\nto you therfore.'  Thanne ansuerd Vryan: 'Madame,\nwel it is true & certayn that we haue herd certayn\ntydynges that the kyng of Cypre is besiged by the\nSawdan within hys Cyte of Famagoce / and thither, yf\nit playse god, we entende & purpose to go for to ayde\n& socoure hym ayenst the fals & mysbyleuers\npaynemys.'  Thanne gan say Melusyne, 'herto muste be\npurueyed / As wel for the see as for the land; and\nwith goddis grace, my dere children, I sha&llbar; ordeyne\ntherof in suche manere that ye shal be remembred of\nme: and this shal I doo shortly.'  The two bretheren\nthenne kneled doun byfore theyne moder / and thanked\nher moche humbly of her purveyaunce & good\nwylle.  And the lady toke hem vp, and sore wepyng she\nkyssed them bothe, For grete sorowe she had in her\nherte / though she made withoutfourth chere of theire\ndepartyng.  For she loued them with moderly loue, as\nshe that had nourysshed them. Thystorye sayth that Melusyne was fu&llbar; curyous\nand besy to make al thinges redy \u00feat were\nnecessary to her sones for their vyage.  She made\nGaleyes, Carrykes, and other grete shippes to be\nvytaylled & redy to say&llbar; / and \u00fee nauye was so grete\nin nombre that it was suffysaunt for foure score\nthousand men of armes to say&llbar; in.  And in the meane\nwhile the two bretheren sent for the two forsaid\nknightes, & said to them that they shuld be redy to\nmeve fourth shortly, as they had promysed to\nthem.  And they ansuered: 'Lordes, we be a&llbar; redy.  and\nmany gentylmen that we knowe ben shapen & redy to\ngo with you in your felawship, and we alle be desyrous\nto serue you and to doo your playsir.'  'By my feyth,'\nsaid Vryan, 'right grete gramercy to you.  We sha&llbar; lede them wel, yf god wyl and you also.'  Now\nthenne, shortly to saye, Melusyne dyde so moche that\nal was redy, and had foure Barons to whome she\nbetoke the kepyng & gouernaunce of her two sones. and\nhad grete foyson of gentylmen knightes & squyers,\nvnto the nombre of two thousand V c men of armes, &\nfyue houndred archers / and as many men with\ncrossebowes.  And thenne the vytaylles, artylery, harneys &\nhorses were charged in to the vesselles, an syn mounted\nthe men into the same.  There were seen baners &\nstandarts / and the sowne of trompes & tambours and\nof many other instruments was herd, that eury one\nenjoyed that sawe it / And the two brethern toke leue\nof \u00feeire bretheren and frendes, & of the peple of the\nland, that moche tenderly wept for theire\ndepartyng.  And Raymondin & Melusyne conueyed theire children\nvnto the see; and whan they come there Melusyne\ndrew hem apart, and said to them: 'Dere children,\nvnderstand this that I will te&llbar; you & commande.'/ 'Children,' sayd Melusyne, 'here be two rynges\nthat I gyue you / of whiche the stones ben of\none lyke vertue.  and wete it that as long that ye\nsha&llbar; vse of feythfulnes, without to think eny euyl, ne\ndoo trychery or hynderaunce to other / hauyng alwayes\nthe said rynges & stones vpon you, ye shall not be\ndyscomfyted ne ouercome in no faytte of armes, yf ye\nhaue good quare&llbar;.  ne also sort or enchauntment of\nart Magique, ne poysons of whatsomeuer manere shul\nnot lette ne greve you / but that assoone as ye sha&llbar; see them they sha&llbar; lese theyre strengthe.'  and she\ndelyuered to eyther of hem one / and they thanked\nher moc&hbar;, kneelyng to therthe.  And yet said Melusyne\nto them in this manere: 'My dere & beloued children,\nI wol & charge you that wher so euer ye be, ye here\nthe deuyne seruyse or euer ye doo eny o\u00feer werk. also that in a&llbar; your affayres & dedes ye clayme &\ncalle thayde & help of our Creatour, and serue hym\ndiligently, and loue & dredde hym as your god &\nyour maker.  and that allwayes ye honoure & worship\nwith a&llbar; your power holy chirc&hbar;, beyng her champyons,\nthe same to susteyne & withstand ayenst alle her euyl\nwyllers.

For\nthey that haue wel deserued to be of you rewarded\nshuld not be wel apayed ne content therof / and the\nstraungers shuld mocke you behinde your backe.  and\nkepe ye promyse, or behighte no thing but that ye\nmay fournysshe & hold it.  and yf ye promyse eny\nthing, tary not the delyueraunce of it, For long taryeng\nquenchith moc&hbar; the vertu of the yefte.  kepe wel ye\nrauysshe no woman / ne be coueytous of other mens\nwyues, of whom ye wil be loued and hold for your\nfrendes.  believe not the Counsey&llbar; of none / but first\nye knowe his manere, deeling & condycyons.  also\nbeleue not the counsey&llbar; of Flatterers, and enuyous, &\nauarycyous / ne suche putte not in none office aboute\nyou, For they cause rather to their maister dyshonour & shame, than ony worship or prouffyt.  kepe wel ye\nborow nothing but that ye may yeld it ayen / and yf\nfor nede ye be constrayned for to borow / as soone as ye\nmay / make restitucion of it / And \u00feus ye shal mowe\nbe without danger, & lede honourable lyf.  And yf\ngod graunte that Fortune be to you good & propyce in\nsubduyng your enmyes & theire landes, gouerne wel\nyour folke and peuple after the nature & condycion\nthat they be of.  and yf they be rebe&llbar;, kepe wel that\nye surmounte & ouercome hem without to lese eny\nsuche ryght that longith to your lordship & seignourye /\nand that ye euer make good watche vnto tyme ye haue\nvaynquysshed at your wylle.  For yf ye ouertredde\nyour self / nedes ye muste rule your self after theire\nwylle.  but alwayes kepe wel, whether they be euyl &\nhard, or debonnaire, that ye ne haunce & sette new\ncustomes that be vnraysonnable / and of them take\nonly your dute and ryght, without to retay&llbar; \u00feem without and ayenst raison.  For yf the peple is\npouere / the lord shal be vnhappy / and yf werr came\nhe shuld not mowe be holpe of them att hys nede /\nwherfore he might fa&llbar; into grete daunger &\nseruytude.

And aboue a&llbar; thinges I forbede you pryde /\nand commande you to doo & kepe justice, yeldyng\nright aswel to the leste as to the moost / and desyre\nnot to be auenged at vttermost of a&llbar; the wronges don\nto you by some other / but take suffisaunt & raysonnable amendes of hym that offreth it.  Dyspreyse not\nyour enmyes though they be litel, but make euer good\nwatche.  and kepe wel as long ye be conqueryng, that\natwix your felawes ye mayntene nat yourself as lord\n& sire / but be commyn & pryue bothe to more &\nlesse / and ye owe to hold them company after the\nqualite & vocacyon that they be of, now to one & now\nto other.  For al this causeth the hertes of creatures to\ndrawe vnto the loue of them that are humayn, meke &\ncurteys in theire dignite & seignouryes.  Haue an\nherte as a fyers Lyon ayenst your enemyes / and shew\nto them your puyssaunce and valyauntyse.  and yf god\nendoweth you with some goodes, departe som of it to\nyour felawes after he hath deserued.  And as to the\nwerre, byleue the counsey&llbar; of the valyaunt & worthy\nmen that haue haunted & vsed it.  Also I defende\nyou that no grete treatee ye make with your enmyes,\nFor in long treatee lyeth somtyme grete falshed.  For\nalwayes wyse men goo abacke for to lepe the ferther;\nand whan the sage seeth \u00feat he is not able to resyste\nayenst the strengthe of his enemyes, he seketh &\npurchaceth alwayes a treatee, for to dyssymyle vnto\ntyme he seeth hymself mighty ynough for them / and\nthanne anoone of lyght they fynd waye & manere\nwherby the treatees ben of none effect ne\nvalue.  Wherfore loke ye, forbere not your enemyes there, as\nye may putte them vnder your subgection with\nhonour.  And thenne yf ye shew them fauour & curtoysye, that\nshal tourne to your grete honour / and leue ye to doo\nfor them by treatee or appoyntement.  For though no\nfalshed or decepcion be founde in none of bothe sydes /\nyet shuld mow some men say or thinke that ye\nsomwhat doubted them / how be it, I say not that\nmen owe to reffuse good traytee, who that may haue\nit' /  Thus, as ye here, chastysed & endoctryned\nMelusyne her two sones, Vryan & Guyon, whiche thanked her moche humbly.  and thenne she sayd: 'Children,\nI haue sent gold & syluer ynoughe in to your ship for\nto hold & maynten your estate, and to pay therwith\nyour men for foure yere. And haue no doubte or\ncare for bred, byscuyte, Freshe watre, vynaigre, Flessh\nsalted, fyssh ynough, & good wynes suffysaunt to long\ntyme, For thereof ben your shippes wel fylled &\npurueyed.  goo thanne fourth on your waye, vnder the\nsauegarde of god / who kepe you / lede & retourne you\nagayn with joye.  and I pray you that ye thinke &\nremembre what I haue sayd to you, to fulfy&llbar; it after\nyour power.'/", "21": "Cap. XXI. How Uryan & Guyon tooke leue of theire moder Melusyne and entred theire ship. / Thenne they toke leue of theyre fader and moder\nand entred theire vesse&llbar;.  This doon, the\nancres were had in, & the saylles haled vp, the\npatrons made theire recommendacions to god as\ncustomed it is, to that by hys benygne grace he wyl\ngraunte to them good ryuage, and accomplysshing of\ntheyre vyage without lettyng or empeschement.  The\nwyndes were for them propyce & good / and in short\ntyme they were ferre cast on the see so that they were\nout of sight / \u00b7 Thanne departed Raymondyn & Melusyne, and\ntheyre meyne with them, and came to the Castel\nEglon.  And here resteth thystorye of them, and\nretourneth to spek of Vryan and Guyon hys brother, and\nof theyre felawship that saylled on the see, holding\ntheire way toward Cypre. / Thystory sayth that whan Uryan and Guyon were\ndeparted fro Rochelle they saylled long on the see, and passed by many yles, & refresshed them in\nmany places; and so long they rowed \u00feat they sawe\nmany vesselles that chased two galeyes / and thenne\nthe Patron shewed them to \u00fee two brethern / and they\nansuered, and demanded of them what was best to\ndoo.  'By my feyth,' sayd the Patron, 'it were good we send\na galeye to wete what folke they be / and in the meane\nwhile we shal make our men to take theyre armes &\nharneys on them at al auauntures.'  'By my feith,'\nsaid Vryan, 'that I vouchesaf' / and they dide\nsoo.  And thanne the galeye departed abrode, and saylled\ntoward the straungers / and escryed \u00feem, & demanded\nof them what they were, and they ansuerd, 'We\nbe two galeyes of Rodes that haue be found of the\npaynemys that foloweth & chaceth vs, and we see wel\nye be Cristen, and so are a&llbar; they that come after\nyou.'  'By my feyth,' sayd they of the galeye, 'we\nben as ye suppose and saye.'  'By my heed,' said one\nof the patrons of Rodes galeyes / 'goo & haste your\nfelawship, For ye haue found fayre auenture.  yonder\nbe of the sawdans folke that goo to the siege of\nFamagosse / and who might dystroye them, he shuld doo\ngrete socoure to the king of Cypre / and to the sawdan\nof Damaske grete dommage.'  Whan thenne they of\nthe galeye herd this / they sodaynly retourned &\nannounced it to the two bretheren / and to theire folke\nwhiche anon yede vp to the Castels of theire shippes,\nand clymed vp to the toppes of them, hauyng speere &\ndarts, stones, & wild fyre alredy / also bowes & arowes\nin theire handes / gonnes & pouldre to shote\nwith.  There bygan tompes to blowe vp, & rowed mightily\ntoward the paynemys.  And whan the Infideles &\npaynemys perceyued so grete nombre of shippes rowyng\ntoward them they ne wyst not what to thinke, For\nthey had neuer supposed that so grete puyssaunce &\nstrenghte of cristen men had be so nygh them /  \u00b7 but alwayes they putte hem self in aray gooyng abacke,\nbut oure galeyes aduyronned them round about on al\nsydes, and bygan of al partes to shutte theire\ngonnes.  And whan the paynemys sawe this / and that they\nmyght not flee, they toke a vessel whiche they had\ntake fro them of rodes, and had cast the folke that was\nin it into the see / and fylled it with wode, oyle, &\ntalowe, and with sulphre & brymstone. and whan they\nsawe our folk approuched nyg&hbar; them they sette it\nafyre. and whan the fyre was wel kyndled they lefte\nit behynd them to mete first with our folke / but as\ngod wold they were warned thereof & kept / themself\nwel therfro / and assaylled theire enmyes at the other\nsyde right vygourously.  There was grete shotyng of\ncrosbowes & gonnes / and soone after our folk entred\nbyforce and strengthe of armes the shippes of the\npaynemys / and fynally they were take & dyscomfyted,\nand putte to deth.  and our folke gate there grete good\nwhiche the two brethern departed, and gaf to theire\nfelawes and to them that wer within the two galeyes of\nRodes / and syn rowed & saylled both so long that\nthey arryued in the yle of Rodes.  And there they\nrefresshed them, & gaf to the brethern of the religyon\nthe fustes & galeyes that they had taken vpon the\npaynemys, and they soiurned there foure dayes.  And\nthe maister of Rodes prayd them that they wold come\ninto the Cite / and they dide soo / and were there\nhonourably receyued / and the said maister demanded\nthem of the cause of their commyng.  And the two\nbrethern told hym that they were come forto socoure\nthe king of Cypre / And he asked them fu&llbar; humbly of\nwhat lan&dtail; they were, and what they were / and the\ntwo brethern told to hym a&llbar; the trout&hbar;.  Thenne made\nthe maister to them greter chere than tofore / and said\nto them that he shuld send for som of his bretheren / &\nthat he shuld goo with hem to helpe & socoure the king of Chipre.  And the two bretheren thanked hym\nmoche humbly therefore. / Now sayth thystorye that so long abode, &\nsoiourned the two brethern at Rodes tyl the\nmaister had assembled his folke, and vytaylled & laden\nwith good men of armes, & archers six galeys, &\nsaylled with Uryan & Guyon so long that they arryued\nnygh to the yle of Coles, & apperceyued grete\nlyght.  Thenne the grete maister of Rodes that was in Uryan's\ngaleye, said to the two bretheren: 'Sires, in good feyth\nit were good & wel doon to send a Carue&llbar; vnto yonder\nyle, to knowe & aspye what folke is there.'  'I\nvouchsaf it,' said Vryan.  The Rampyn then, or Carue&llbar;,\nsaylled thither, & arryued in to the said yle, & some\nof \u00feem descended & founde many grete fyres & lodgis,\nand by thexperience that they sawe, they extimed them\n\u00feat had lodged there to the nombre of xxx thousan&dtail;\nmen / and that they myght wel haue dwelled \u00feer foure\nor fyue dayes.  For they found without the lodgys grete\nfoyson of oxen hornes & of other bestes.  And then\nthey came ayen in to theire Vesse&llbar;, and retourned\ntoward our folke / & recounted to them the trouth of\nall that they had found.  'By my feith,' said thenne\nthe maister of Rodes, 'I wene they be paynemys that\nare gooyng toward the sawdan at the siege, and that\nthey whiche ye haue dyscomfyted were of theire\nfelawship, & abode for them in that same yle' / and for\ncertayn they were soo / and of them they sayled &\nrowed fourth tyl they sawe an abbey on the see coste,\nwhere men sought & worshiped saynt Andrew / and\nmen saith that there is the potence or cros wheron the\ngood thef Dysmas was crucefyed whan our lord was\nnayled to the Cros for our redempcion.  'Sire,' said\nthe maister, 'it were good that we should entre that\nlytil hauen Vnto tyme that we had sent to Lymasson\nfor to knowe tydinges, & for to wete yf they wyl receyue vs for to putte our nauye in surete within\ntheyre clos.'  'Maister,' said Uryan, 'let it be doon in\nthe name of god after your playsire.'  Thenne they\narryued, and entred the port or hauen / and sent\nwordes to thabbot ther, that they shuld not doubte, For\nthey were theire frendes.  And the maister of Rodes\nwith other went thider.  And whan thabbot & monkes\nknew the tydinges and the commyng of the two\nbrethern, they were joyous & glad, & sent some of\ntheire bretheren to Lymas to announce & telle \u00fee socours\nthat was arryued at theire porte.  Thenne whan a\nknyght, Captayn of the place, herde these tydinges he\nwas fayn & glad, and made fourthwith a galyotte to\nbe shipped redy, and came toward our folke, and\ndemanded after the lord of that armee /.  and he to\nwhome he asked it lede hym where Uryan / Guyon\nhis brother / the master of Rodes, & many other barons\nwere in a ryche pauyllon, that they had don to be\ndressed on the streyte of the porte / and shewed to\nhym Vryan that satte on a couche with hym his\nbrother, and the maister of Rodes.  And whan he saw\nhym he was abasshed of the valeur & of the grete fyerste\nof hym, & neuer\u00feeles he yede & salued hym\nhonourably, and Vryan receyued him goodly &\nbenyngly.  'Sire,' said the Knight, 'ye be welcome in to this\nland.'  'Fayre sirs,' said Vryan, 'moche grete thankes\nto you.' 'Sire,' said the knight, 'it is don me to\nvnderstand that ye departed fro your Countrie to\nthentent to come ayde & help the king of Cypre.'\n'By my feyth,' said Uryan, 'it is trout&hbar;.' 'Then, sire,'\nsaid the knight, 'it is reson that al be open byfore you,\nwhere ye wyl by a&llbar; the royalme of Cypre, thrugh a&llbar;\ntounnes, Cites, & Castels there as ye shal be please to\ngoo, but as to the same, whic&hbar; is to my ryght redoubted\nlord the king of cypre, hit shal be soone appareylled &\nopen to you, whan it sha&llbar; lyke you, & also the porte to putte your vessels in sauete.'  'By my feyth,' said\nUryan, 'ye say right wel, & gramercy to you.  Sire\nknight, it is tyme to meve, For my brother and I haue\ngrete langyng to approche nygh the paynemys / not for\ntheire prouffyt, but for theire dommage, if it plaise god\nthat we so doo.'  'Sire,' said the knight, 'it is good\nye doo to be had out some of your horses as many\nas it lyke you / and take som of your men with you,\nand we sha&llbar; goo by land.'  'By my feith,' sayd Uryan,\n'ye say right wel' / and thus it was doon / and Uryan\nmade some of hys men to be armed, vnto the nombre\nof foure hundred gentylmen of the moost hye barons,\nknightes & squyers.  and he himself, & his brother\narmed them and mounted on horsbak / and the banere\ndysployed, rode fourth in moc&hbar; fayre ordynaunce / and\nthe maister of Rodes & the other shipped them on the\nsee & rowed toward the porte.  And Vryan and his\nfelawship rode with the said knight that guyded hym\nso long that they came & entred in to the toune, and\nwere right well lodged.  And then came the nauye,\n& arryued to the porte, and the horses were a&llbar; had out\nof the shippes, and the folke descendid to land, and\nlodged them in \u00fee feld without the toune within\ntentes & pauyllons / and they that had none, made\ntheire lodgis the best wyse they coude.  and was moche\ngrete playsaunce to see thoost whan they were alle\nlodged.  The moost hye barons lodgyd them within\nthe toune / and the nauye was draw, & had in to the\nclos in sauete / and they commytted good folke to\ndeffende & kepe it, yf Sarasyns or paynemys came\nthere for to doo som euyl.  Now shal I leue to speke\nof Uryan, & shal say of the Captayn of the toune\nthat moche wel aduysed thoost and the maynten of the\nfolke, & moche preysed it in his herte / and said wel\nthey were folke of faytte and of grete enterpryse, whan\nso few peuple enterprysed for to haue the vyctory ouer the sawdan, that had with hym more than houndred\nthousand paynemys.  And for to say trouth, Vryan\nhad not yet comprised the men of the maister of Rodes,\neyghte thousand fyghtyng men / and therfore the\nknight meruaylled, and held it to grete audacite &\nhardynes of herte, and to grete valyaunce.  And whan\nhe considered the grandeur & the facion of Vryan, &\nthe fyerste of hys vysage, and also of guyon hys\nbrother / he said to his folke / 'thoo same are worthy\nfor to subdue & conquere a&llbar; the world.'  and he said\nto hymself, \u00feat god had sent hem thither of his benyng\ngrace for to socoure the kyng, and for to enhaunce the\ncristen feyth, and that he shuld lete it to be knowen to\nthe kynge by certayn message. Thystorye sayth that the knight made a lettre, the\ntenour of whiche conteyned al the matere of\nUryan, & of his brother, of theire men, & of theire\ncommyng, and how the two bretheren had to name,\nand of what countre they were / and syn he called one\nhys nevew, & said to hym in this manere, 'ye muste\nbere this lettre to Famagosse, and gyue it to the kyn&gtee; /\nand whatsoeuer it happeth that god forbede, but al\ngood to you, nedes ye muste doo it.' 'By my feyth,\nsire,' said he / 'ye sha&llbar; putte bothe the lettres &\nmyself in grete jeopardye & auenture, For if by some\nmyschief, as it happeth ofte, whereof god preserue me I\nwere taken of our enmyes, of my lyf is nothing / and\nye wote it wel / but for the loue of you, myn vncle &\nof the kyng, to doo hym comfort, & to gyue hym herte\n& hoop to be putte & delyuered fro hys enemyes, & fro\nthe mortal parel wherin he is now, I shall putte myself\nin aduenture / and I pray to god deuoutly, that it\nplease hym of his benigne grace to lede me gooyng &\ncommyng in sauete,' / 'Thus owe men to serue theire\nlord,' said the Captayne, 'and yf god wyl ye shalbe wel\nrewarded therof.'  and anoone he toke the lettre, & delyuered it to his nevew / \u00feat mounted on horsbacke,\n& rode fourthon his way.  But as for now I sha&llbar; reste\nof hym / and I shal retourne there I lefte to spek of\nVryan / and shal say howe he gouerned hymself whiles\nthe messager yede toward the kin&gtee;.  how wel he knew\nnat of it. / Thystory saith that Vryan called to hym the maister\nof Rodes and the Captayn of the place, and\ndemanded of them thus: 'Fayre lordes, is the sawdan\nsomewhat yong, ne of grete enterpryse' / and they\nansuer&dtail;, 'that ye for certayn' / 'and how,' said Vryan,\n'was he neuer byfore this place to make warre than\nnow?' / they ansuer&dtail; that, 'nay' / 'and what thenne,'\nsaid Vryan, 'hath caused hym to passe the see now?\nsith he is man of enterpryse, I mervey&llbar; that so long\nhe held hym styl, seeyng ye be his nig&hbar; neygbours,\nand also that he hath so grete puissaunce, as it is told\nme.' 'By my feyth, sire,' said the Captayne, 'it is\nveray & trouth that our kyng hath a moc&hbar; fayr\ndoughter of the age of .xv.  yere, the whic&hbar; the saudan wol&dtail;\nhaue had by force / and our kyng wold not acorde her\nto hym without he wold be baptysed.  And wete it\nthat euer here tofore we had trewes togidre of so long\ntyme that no mynde is of \u00fee contrarye.  and whan the\nsawdan hath seen that our king wold not graunt to\nhym his doughter, he sent ageyn to hym the trewes\nwith a deffyaunce or chalengyng, and was redy on the\nsee with a .C. & fyfty thousand paynemys, and came &\nmade soone his harneys to be had out on erthe, & wente\nand layd siege tofore Famagoce, where he found the\nkyng all vnpurveyed of his baronye, that knew not of\nhis commyng / but syn there be entred moche folke\nwithin the Cite ayenst his euyl gree, & there is now\nfayre scarmysshing where grete losse hath be on both\npartes / and syn the paynemyes have refresshed\nthemself twyes of new folke, in so moc&hbar; that they ben yet wel a .C ml. / but at this last vyage they haue lost a\nparte of theire shippes & of theire folke, whic&hbar; they\nabode fore in the yle of Coles, For one of our galleyes\nof the blakke hylle that pursyewed them told it to vs,\n& how they chaced two galleyes of the hospytal of\nRodes / and wete it that \u00feey ne wote not where they\nbycame syn, For they taryed after wel by the space\nof six dayes in the said yle / but whan they sawe that\nthey came not, they departed thens & came byfore\nfamagoce at siege.'  'By my feyth, sire,' sayd the\nmaister of Rodes, 'this might wel be veray trouth. but\nsee here my lord Vryan and hys brother, that shuld\nwel ansuere therof, For they haue be a&llbar; dyscomfyted\n& slayn by theire strengthe & valiauntis, and they haue\ngyuen to vs theire fustes & their nauye.'  'In good\nfeyth,' sayd the knight, 'that playseth me wel, and\nblessid be god therof.'  'My lord,' said the Captayn,\n'now haue I recounted to you why the werre is meued,\nand wherefore the saudan of Damaske hath passed the\nsee.'  'In the name of god,' said Vryan, 'loue hath\nwel so moche & more of puyssaunce than of suche\nenterpryse to doo.  And wete that syn the sawdan is\nenterprysed of force of loue, the more he is to be\ndoubted / For veray soth it is / that loue hath so moche\nof myght that it maketh coward to be hardy and to\ndoo right grete enterpryse / & that byfore he durst not\npasse.  And therfore thenne it is a&llbar; certayn to this,\nthat the sawdan is hardy & enterprenaunt the more\nhe doth hym to be doubted / but alwayes be doo the\nwylle of god.  For we sha&llbar; departe hens to the playsire\nof god to morow by tymes after the deuyne servyce\nfor to goo & vysyte them.'  And then he made to be\ncryed & proclamed with the trompette that euery man\nshuld make redy hys harneys. and they departed after\nthe thirde sowne of the trompette in goodly & fayre\nordynaunce, euerone vnder his banere / and bade them to siew the vanward / and so they dide.  here I sha&llbar;\nleue to spek of them / and sha&llbar; retourne there as I\nlefte to speke of the Captayns nevew that moche\nstrongly rode toward Famagoce / and so moche\nexployted his way that he came about midnyght to the\nCornere of the wode, vpon a lytil mountayn, & loked\ndoun into the valeye, and then he bygan to perceyue\n& see the oost of the paynemys, where as was grete\nlyght of fyres that were made by the lodgys; and he\nsawe the Cite so aduyronned al about with paynemys,\nthat he ne wyst whic&hbar; way to draw for to entre the\ntoun. and there he was long tyme in grete \u00feoughte.\nIt happed that about the spryng of the day foure score\nbasynets, straungers of dyuerse nacyons, yssued out at\na posterne of the Cyte, & commevyd al thoost by\nmanere of batay&llbar; / and that same ooure the watche\ndeparted, & the moost part of them was retourned to\ntheyre lodgis / and they entred in the oost with some\nof them that had watched without they were ware of\nhem, & supposed they had be of theire companye, and\ncame nygh to the tente of the sawdan / and thenne\nthey bygan to launche & smyte with speeres & with\nswerdes on al the paynemys that they mete &\nrecountred / and cutted cordes of pauyllons to grete\ndesray, & made moche horryble occysyon & slaghtir\nof paynemys after the quantite that they were of.\nThenne was al the host afrayd, and bygan to crye alarme\n& to harneys / then bygan thoost to take on them theire\narmures.  And whan the cristen men sawe force &\nstrengthe of theire enemyes that bygan to ryse, they\nretourned with a lytel paas toward the Cite, fleeyng &\ncastyng to therthe al that they recountred on theire\nwaye.  And whan the messaunger sawe so grete affraye\n& noyse he cam at al auenture & broched hys hors\nwith the spoorys, and passed without fourth the lodges\nthrugh out a&llbar; the oost of \u00fee paynemys / and he had not goo long whan he found hymself atwix the Cite &\nthem that so had commoeuyd thoost, as said is.  And\nthen he knew them soone ynoug&hbar; that they were of the\ngarnyson of the Cyte, and escryed them, saying: 'ha,\nha, fayre lordes, thinke to doo wel, For I bryng you\ngood tydynges; For the floure of the noble cheualrye\nof Crystyante cometh to socoure & helpe you / that is\nto wete the two damoyseaulx of Lusynen, that haue\ndyscomfyted alredy a grete part of the Sodanis folke\nvpon the see / and they bryng with them wel eyght\nthousand men.  And thenne whan they understode\nhym they made hym grete chere and were ryght joyfu&llbar;,\nand entred the toune ayen without eny losse. wherof\nthe sawdan was moc&hbar; wofu&llbar; & angry.  And then he\ncame & bygan the scarmoushe before the barers &\nmany paynemys were there slayn & dede / and they\nof Cypre made theire enemyes to recule abacke with\nstrengthe / and the saudan made the trompette to\nsowne & ca&llbar; the retrette whan he sawe that he myght\ndoo none other thing.  And \u00feen came the said\nmessaunger byfore the kynge, & made the reuerence on\nhys vnclis byhalue, and presented the lettre.  And the\nkyng receyued hym moche benyngly, & tok away the\nwax and opend the lettre & sawe the tenour of hit. /\nand syn heued vp his handes joyntly toward heuen, &\nsaid:  'ha, a veray gloryous god, Jhesu Criste, I \u00feank\nregracye & mercye the ryght deuoutly & humbly of\nthis, that thou hast not forgoten me that am thy pouere\ncreature and thy pouere seruaunt, that haue long tyme\nlyued here within this Cite in grete doubte & feere, and\nin grete myserye of my poure lyuyng and my folke also.'\nAnd thenne he made to be announced in al the chirches,\nthat they shuld ryng theire belles, & that processyons\nshuld be made with crosses & baners, and with torches\nbrennyng, lawdyng & preysyng the creator of creatures,\nprayeng hym moche humbly that he of his mercyfu&llbar; & benynge grace wyl kepe & preserue them fro the handes\n& daunger of mysbyleuers paynmys.  And thanne\nbygan the ryngyng to be grete, & was the joye ryght\ngrete whan the tydynges of the socours commyng to\nthem was knowen of a&llbar;.  And whan the paynemys\nvnderstode the gladnes & joye that they of the cyte\nmade, they were moche abasshed why they made &\ndemened so grete feeste.  'By my feyth,' sayd the\nsaudan, 'they have herd some tydinges that we wote\nnot / or ellis they doo so for to gyue vs vnderstandyng\nthat they haue folke ynoughe & vytaylles also for to\ndeffende & withstande ayenst vs.'   And here resteth\nthystorye of the soudan & bygynneth to speke of\nErmyne the kingis doughtir of Cypre, whic&hbar; herd\nthere as she was in her chambre the tydynges of the\nsocours that the children of Lusynen brought with\nthem.  and the mayde had grete langyng & desyre to\nknowe the veray trouth of a&llbar;. The hystorye saith to vs thus / that whan the\ndamoyselle knew of the socours & help that soone\nshe sent for hym that had brought the tydinges therof,\nand he came to her in hir chambre & made to her\nthe reuerence.  'Frend,' said Ermyne, 'ye be\nwelcome to me; but now te&llbar; me of your tydinges.'  and\nhe recounted to her al that was of it.  'Frende,' said\nthe mayde, 'have ye seen that folke that commeth to\nsocoure my fader?'  'By my feyth, ye,' said the\nmessanger, 'they are the moost appert in armes, and the\nfayrest men that euer entred in to this land, and the\nbest arayed & purueyed of a&llbar; thinges.'  'Now te&llbar; us,'\nsaid the damoyselle, 'of what land they are, & who is\nthe chief Captayn & lord of them.'  'By my feyth, my\ndamoyselle, they be of Poytou, and lede them two\nyong & fayre damoyseaulx brethren, that be named of\nLusynen, of whiche theldest is called Vryan, & that\nyoungest Guyon, which have not yet berde fu&llbar; growen.' 'Frende,' said the damoyselle, 'be they so fayre\ndamoyseaux as ye say?'  'By my feyth,' said the messager /\n'the eldest is moche grete & hye, strong & of fayre\nbehauyng & maynten, but hys vysage is short & large\nin trauerse / and hath one eye redde, & that other ey is\nperske & blew, and the eerys grete to meruey&llbar;.  and\nwete it wel that of membres & of body he is the fayrest\nknight that euer I sawe / and the yongest is not of so\nhye stature / but he is moche fayre & wel shapen of\nmembres, & hath a face to deuyse, except that one of\nhis eyen is hyer sette than the other is.  and saye alle\nthat see them, that they be worthy & noble to conquere\n& subdue vnder them a&llbar; the world.'  'Frende,' sayd\nErmyne, 'sha&llbar; ye goo agayn soone toward them.'  And\nhe ansuerd, 'my damoyselle, assoone as I may haue tyme\n& place conuenable & propyce for to yssue & go out of\nthe Cite, and that I see I may goodly escape fro the\npaynemys.'  'Frend,' said the damoyselle, 'ye shal on\nmy behalue salue the yong brethern, and ye sha&llbar;\ndelyuere to the eldest this ouc&hbar; and telle hym bere it\nfor the loue of me / and this ryng of gold with this\ndyamond ye shal take to \u00fee lesse, and ye sha&llbar; salew\nhym moche on my byhalf.'  And ansuered, 'my\ndamoyselle, I shall doo it righte gladly.'  He thanne\ndeparted fro her & came to the king that had doon\nwrit his ansuere in a lettre, and made grete foyson of\nmen of armes to arme them redyly, and them made he\nto yssue couertly out of the cyte and entred in to the\noost / and or the oost were armed they adommaged\nthem sore.  And \u00feen yssued paynemys out of theire\ntentes without eny aray, that rechaced them vnto the\nbarrers, where they had grete scarmusshyng & fyers,\nand many men slayn & wounded of bothe partes.  A&llbar;\nthoost arryued where the scarmusshing was / and ther\nwhyles was the said messanger putte out of the Cite\natt another gate, a bow shotte fro al the oost, so that he was nat perceyued.  And thenne he rode hastly\ntoward hys vncle.  For moche he langed that he myght\nthere be arryued for to shew hym a&llbar; the\ntydyinges.  And dured not long the scarmoushe, For the sawdan\nmade it to be cessed, For he sawe wel that he shuld\nmore lese there than wyne.  Now I shal leue to speke\nof this forsaid matere / and sha&llbar; retourne to speke of\nVryan & of his brother. In this parte telleth thistory that Uryan dide hys\ntrompettes to be blowen at the spring of the day,\n& roos & commanded euery man to apparey&llbar; hym,\nand put saddelles on theire horses / and soone after the\ntwo brethern herd theire masse, & semblably dyde the\nother prynces & barons / and after the masse Vryan\nmade to crye, that who wold drynk ones shuld drynk,\nand that ootis shuld be gyuen to the horses, and that\nat the other tyme that the trompette shuld be blowen,\neueryman shuld be redy that was of the Vanwarde.  And they beying in suc&hbar; estate, the Capteyns nevew\narryued there, and delyuered the lettre to hys vncle,\nthat the kyng had taken to hym / and the Captayn\ntoke & kyssed it fourthwith, open&dtail; it, and sawe by the\ntenour of it how the kyng commanded hym to putte\nbothe the fortresse and the toune at the wy&llbar; &\ncommandement of the two bretheren.  Also that he shuld\ncommande to a&llbar; good tounnes, Castels, Fortresses,\nportes, hauens, & passages that they shuld gyue them\nentre & soiourne, and that they shuld obey to\nthem.  And whan the Captayn sawe & vnderstode a&llbar; \u00fee\nsubstance & matere of it, he shewed the lettre to Vryan, & to\nguyon hys brother, the whiche redde it; & whan they\nknew the tenour of it they called to them the captayn,\nthe maister of Rodes, & the two knightes, that had\nanounced to them thauenture of the siege, and redde\nto them the lettre on hye.  'Thenne,' said Uryan to the\nCaptayn, 'we thanke moche the king of the worship that he doth to vs / but as to vs, our entencyon is not\nto entre in to thoos tounes ne castelles, yf we may\ngoodly passe without fourth, For we thinke to kepe the\nfeldes, yf god wyl, & make good werre ayenst the\nsodan, but telle vs what nombre of men may yssue out\nof a&llbar; your garnysons the Fortresses alwayes kept / and\nwete it \u00feat force is to vs to knowe it / and yf they be\nmen of whom we dare trust and be assured / For god\nbefore we tende & purpose to gyue bataylle to the\nSawdan, & to putte to termynacioun, & ende this\nwarre.  For therfore are we come hither.'  'By my faith,'\nsaid the Captayn, 'that shal be hard to doo, For \u00fee\npaynemys are in nombre wel C ML and more.'  'Care\nyou not, therefore,' said Vryan, 'For we haue good\nright in oure caas / they are come vpon vs without\ncause / and though we had goon on them vnto theire\nowne lande, we ought to doo soo, For they are enemyes\nof god / and doubteles though they be of grete nombre\nto the regarde of our felawship / yet one grayne of\npeper alone smertith more on mans tonge than doth\na sacke fu&llbar; of whette / ne victorye also lyeth not in\ngrette multitude of peuple / but in good rule &\nordynaunce.  And wel it is trouth that Alexander, that\nsubdued so many & dyuerse landes, wold not haue with\nhym aboue the nombre of xx ti thousand fyghtyng men\nfor one journey ayenst a&llbar; the world.  And thanne\nwhan the Captayne herd hym speke so valyauntly, he\nheld it to grete wele & valeur, and thoughte he was\nwel able & worthy to conquere & subdue many landes,\nand said to hym in this manere:  'Sire, I sha&llbar; enforce\nyour oost with foure thousand fighting men, and of two\nthousand brygandyners & crosbowes, & other.'  'By\nmy feyth,' said Vryan, 'that is ynoughe / now doo\nthat we may haue hem to half a journey nygh oure\nenemyes,' and he ansuerd there shuld be no fawte of\nit.  And then came there the Captayns nevew, and kneled byfore Vryan & Guyon, and said to them in\nthis manere:  'Noble damoyseaulx / the moost fayre\nmayde / & the moost noble that I knowe salueth you\nbothe, and sendeth you of her jewels' / and thenne he\ntoke the ouche of gold that was sette with many a ryche\n& precyous stone / and said thus to Vryan: 'Sire, hold\n& receyue this ouche of Ermynes byhalf, doughter to\nmy liege lord the kyn&gtee;, that requyreth & beseche\u00fe you\nto were it on you for her sake.'  Vryan toke it\njoyously, and made it to be attached & sette it on his\ncotte of armes, and said to hym: 'My frende, right\ngrete thankes & thousand mercys to the damoyselle\ntha so moche honour sheweth to me / Wete it that I\nsha&llbar; kepe it moche dere for her sake / and gramercy\nto you messanger & brynger of it.'  And after he\npresented and toke to Guyon the ring on the forsaid\ndamoysellis byhalf / and that she prayed hym to bere\nit for the loue & sake of her / And guyon ansuerd that\nso shuld he doo, and putte it on his fynger / and\nthanked moche the damoyselle / and \u00fee messager also /\nand the brethern gaf moche ryche yeftis to the same\nmessager.  And soone after the trompette blew, and\neueryman putte hym self fourth on hys way.  and\nthere myght men be seen in fayre & good\nordynaunce.  And the Captayn sent to a&llbar; the Fortresses & tounes,\nand made to yssue out & assemble togidre a&llbar; the men\nof armes / and wel were of them aboue the nombre\nthat the Captayn had sayd to the two bretheren fyue\nhondred more.  Vryan thenne lodged hym and hys\nfelawship on a lytil ryuere / and on the morne erly\nthey departed, and went fourth tyl they came a lytil\nbyfore mydday, in a fayre medowe, nygh to a grete\nryuere / and there were foyson of trees / also there was\na quarter of a leghe thens a grete bridge, where they\nmuste passe / and fro that bridge vnto Famagoce were\nbut seuen leghes / and there made Vryan hys folke to be lodged, and said he wold aby&dtail; \u00feere the said Captayn\nand his men that he shuld bring with hym.  There\nthey laye that nyght, and abode tyl the morne noone.\nbut alwayes some knightes were goon for theire\ndysporte vnto the said bridge, and aspyed there about xv\nmen of armes that were descended therat / and had\ntheire speeris in theire fystes, and the salades after the\nguyse that they armed them in that Countre / and of\nano\u00feer syde they sawe come about foure houndred\nmen of armes, that peyned them self moche for to\npasse ouer for to greve them of the other side / thanne\ncame one of our Knightes that escryed them, &\ndemanded of them what they were / and one of them\nansuerd, 'we are Cristen / and they that ye see at the\nother side of the watre are paynemys, that come for\nfourrage about the Countre / they haue mete & faught\nwith vs, and they haue slayn wel an C good men that\nwere of our felawship.'  'Now, fayre lordes,' said oure\nknyght, 'yf ye can hold you, ye shal soone haue socours\n& ayde.'  And thenne the knight broched hys hors,\nand waloped toward hys felawes, and recounted to\nthem shortly a&llbar; thauenture.  And whan they\nvnderstode this they hastly came to the oost, and mete\nwith xx ti crosbowes men, to whom they bade they\nshuld hye \u00feem toward the bridge for to help the xv\nmen of armes that were there ayenst thenmyes.  And\nwhan they vnderstode this they walked fast, & cam\nnig&hbar; to the bridge, and sawe thre cristen that were\nouerthrawen on the bridge by strokkes of speerys.\n'Fourth,' said then one of them, 'we tary to longe /\nperceyue you not how this Dogges oppressen vylaynly\nthese valyaunt & worthy crystens?' / and anone they\nbended \u00feeir crosbowes, & shot a&llbar; at ones / and\nouerthrewe doun on the bridge fro theire horses with that\nfirst shotte xxii ti paynemys.  Whan the mysbyleuers\npaynemys sawe this they were sore abasshed, and withdrew themself somwhat backward fro the bridge.\nThenne yede the cristen men, and releuyd vp their\nfelawes that were ouerthrawen on the bridge / and\nthenne they made grete joye & toke good herte / and\nthe Crosbowe men shote so ofte & so strong, that\nthere ne was so bold a paynem that durst putte his\nfoot on the bridghe / but made to come there theire\narchers, & thenne bygan the scarmusshing strong &\ngrete and moche mortal.  but betre had be to the\npaynemys that they had withdrawe them self apart,\nFor the knightes came to the oost and reherced to\nUryan the tydinges therof, the whiche moc&hbar; appertly\narmed hymself, and made hastly a thousand men of\narmes to take theire harneys on them, & rode forth\ntoward the bridge / and ordeyned another thousand\nmen of armes, & C crosbowe men to folowe hym, yf he\nnede had of them / aud commanded that all the oost\nshuld be in ordynaunce of batay&llbar;, & betoke it to the\nkepyng & gouernaunce of guyon his brother, and of\nthe maister of Rodes.  Uryan thanne made the\nstandarde to passe fourth rydyng in batay&llbar; moche\nordynatly / and was Vryan before, hauying a staf on hys\nfyste, & held them wel togidre, and so vnyed, that\none marched nothing afore that other.  But or they\nwere come to the bridge there were come eight\nthousand paynemys, that moche strongly oppressed our\nfolke, and had putte them almost fro the bridge.  but\nanoone came there Vryan, whiche alyghted / toke hys\nspeere, & so dyde hys folke moche appertly / and\nmade hys banere to be dysployed abrode / and were\nthe crosbowe men on bothe sydes of hym vpon the\nbridge / and then they marched fourth, and bygan to\noppresse and rebuke sore the paynemys, and made\nthem to withdrawe bakkwarde.  And there Vryan\ncryed 'Lusynen' with a hye voys & lowde, and yede\n& marched ayenst hys enemys, hys banere euer byfore hym. and hys men after that assaylled the fals dogges\nmoche asprely, Whiche of the other syde bygan to\nlaunche & to smyte.  Uryan smote a paynem on \u00fee\nbrest with hys speere so demesurably, that hys spere\napered at back syde of hym.  they medled them\nfyersly togidre.  but at last the paynemys lost the\nbridge, and many of them fe&llbar; doun in to the ryuere.\nAnd thenne passed the crystens the bridge lyghtly /\nand there bygan the baytay&llbar; moche cruel, For many\nwere there sore hurte & slayn on both partyes.  but\neuer the paynemys were putte abak, & lost moche of\nground.  Vryan made to passe the horses, for wel he\nperceyued that his enemyes wold mounte on theire\nhorses to putte them self to flyght.  Thenne came the\narregarde that asprely passed ouer the bridge / and\nwhan the paynemys perceyued them they were sore\naffrayed / and who that myght flee, fledd toward theire\nfolke that lede theyre proye, oxen, kyn & shep, swynes\n& othre troussage.  Uryan than lepte on horsback, and\nmade hys folke to doo soo, & commanded the\narrergarde that passed them ouer the bridge, that they\nshuld folowe hym in fayre ordynaunce of bataylle /\nand so they dyde / and Uryan & hys folke chaced the\npaynemys that fledd sore chaffed & aferd, For al they\nthat were by Uryan, & they of hys felawship atteyned,\nwere putte to deth / and endured the chasse with grete\noccysyon & slaghter \u00fee space of fyue ooures & more.\nAnd thenne the paynemys ouertoke theyre folke, &\nmade them to leue behynd them alle theyre proy,\n& came vpon a grete mountayne toward Famagoce /\nand \u00feer the paynemys reassembled, & putte them self\nin ordynaunce.  but there came Vryan & his folke,\ntheire speris on theire fystes alowe / at that\nrecountryng were many one slayn & wounded sore, of one\nsyde & of other / the paynemys susteyned the stoure\nstrongly, For they were a grete nombre of folke.  but Uryan assaylled them vygourously / and so moche he\ndide there of armes that a&llbar; were abasshed, and had\ngrete wonder of it.  Then came thither the arregarde\nthat was of a thousand men of armes, & C crosbowe\nmen whic&hbar; entred, & marched sodaynly vpon theyre\nenemyes, & faught so strongly that the paynemys were\nputte abacke, & lost ground.  and so fyersly was\nshewed there the cheualry & hardynes of Cristen folke,\nthat soone they had the vyctory, and putte theyre\nenmys to flight, of whiche lay dede on the place foure\nthousand & more, without them that were slayn at\nforsayd bridge / and the chasse endured vnto nygh the\noost & siege of the paynemys.  Thenne Vryan made\nhys folke to withdrawe them, and ledd with them the\nproye that the paynemys had lefte behynd.  And\nthus within a short while they eslongyd ferre one fro\nother / and our folke retourned to the bridge / and the\npaynemys went fourth to theire oost cryeng alarme.\nWherfore euery man went to harneys, & yssued out of\ntheire tentes / and thenne one of them recounted to\nthe sawdan all thaduenture \u00feat happed to them.  And\nwhan the sawdan herd of it, he wondred moc&hbar; who\nmight haue brought \u00feat folke, that so grete harme &\ndommage had born vnto hym.  Thanne was there grete\naffray in thoost, & grete noyse of trompettes.  Wherof\nthey of the Cite merueylled what thing it might be, &\narmed them self / and eueryone was in his garde / and\nthere came to the gate one of the knightes that were\nat forsayd brydge, whiche had putte hym in auenture\nto passe thrugh a&llbar; thoost, and knewe the convyne of\none parte & of other, also the grete fayttes of armes that\nVryan had don / he escryed hye with a lowde voys /\n'open the gate!  For I bring you good tydynges.'  And\nthenne they demanded of hym what he was / and he\nansuerd, 'I am one of the knightes of the fortres of the blak mountayne.'  And thanne they opend the gate,\nand he entred, and they ledd hym toward the kin&gtee;,\nthat soone knew hym.  For other tyme he had seen\nhym.  The knight then enclyned hym before the\nking, and made to hym the reuerence / and the kinge\nreceyued hym moche benyngly / and demanded to hym\nsom tydynges; and he reherced to hym worde by wor&dtail;\nall the faytte / and how Vryan dyde, & had rescued\nthe proye / also of thauenture of the bridge, and alle\nother thinges, & how hys entencion & wylle was for to\ngyue batay&llbar; to the sawdan, and to reyse the siege / &\nthat shortly / \u00b7 'By my feyth,' sayd the kyng, 'that\nman ought me god wy&llbar;, for to rescue my land of the\nfel & cruel dogges paynemys / and for the holy feyth\ncrysten to susteyne & enhaunse / and, certaynly, I\nsha&llbar; to morne doo fele to the sawdan \u00feat my socour\n& help is nygh redy to my behauf & playsire, & that\nI doubte hym not of nothing.'  'My frende,' said the\nkyng to the knyght, 'goo & say these good tydynges to\nmy doughter.'  'Sire,' said the knight, 'right\ngladly.'  Then came he in to the chambre where the mayde\nwas, and moche humbly salued her, and rehersed to\nher a&llbar; the auenture.  'How, sire knight,' said she,\n'were ye at that bataylle?'  'By my feyth, damoyselle,'\nansuerde the knight, 'ye.'  'And how,' sayd she, 'that\nknyght that hath so straunge a face, is he such a fyghter\nas men saye?'  'By my feyth, my damoyselle, ye\nmore than a houndred tymes / For he ne dreddeth no\nman, al be he neuer so grete & so pusyssaunt.  And\nwete it what that men saye to you of hym / he is one\nof the moost preu & hardy knightes that euer I sawe in\nmy lyf.'  'By my feyth,' sayd the damoyselle, 'yf he\nhad now hyerid you for to preyse & speke wel of hym,\nhe hath wel employed hys coste.'  'By my feyth, my\ndamoyselle, I spake neuer with hym.  but yet he is betre worthy than I telle you.'  Then she ansuered to the\nknight, 'goodnes & bounte is betre than fayrenes &\nbeaulte.' And here leueth thystorye to speke of the\nmayde / and retourneth to Vryan, \u00feat abode at the\nbridge, and founde hys oost lodged at this syde of the\nbridge / And also the Captayne \u00feat had brought the\nmen of armes, that he leuyed fro the garnysons &\nfortresses vnto the nombre of V ML men of armes, with\ntwo thousand V. C. crosbowe men / and also there were\nmany footmen / And \u00feey were alle lodged in the\nmedowe at the other syde of the ryuere.  Where\nVryan found his pauyllon dressed vp / and the other\nthat had be at the pursyewte & chaas of the paynemys,\nthey lodged \u00feem that nyght the best wyse they coude,\n& made good watche.  And here resteth thystory\ntherof, and bygynneth to speke of the kyng of Cypre, that\nwas moche joyous & glad of the socours that was\ncome to hym / and regracyed deuoutely our lord of\nit / and in that party passed the nyght.  But who\nsomeuer was glad that was Ermyne, For she coude not\nby no manere in the world haue out of her thoughte\nVryan, and desired moche to see hym for the well\nthat it was said of hym / in so moche that she said in\nherself, that yf he now had the vysage more straunge &\nmore contrefaytte than he had / yet he is wel shappen\nfor his proesse & bounte to haue the doughtir of the\nmoost high kynge in the world to hys paramour.  And\nso thoughte the damoyselle al the nyght on Vryan,\nFor loue by hys grete power had broughte her\ntherto.  Here resteth thystorye to speke of her, & bygynneth to\nspeke of the kyng her fader. The hystorye recounteth here, that on the morne\nat the spryng of the day, the kynge had hys\nfolke a&llbar; redy, & yssued out of the Cyte with a thousand\nmen of armes, and wel a thousand of Crosbowemen; and some brygandyners were embusshed at bothe\nthendes of the barrers, for to helpe & socoure hym yf\nhe were to moche oppressyd by the paynemys.  And\n\u00feen the king entred in to thoost, & bare grete dommage\nto hys enemys.  For he had commanded vpon peyne\nof deth that none shuld take eny prysoner, but that\nthey shuld putte a&llbar; to deth / and this dide he for\ncause they shuld not tende to the dyspoylle & proye,\nand that at laste he myght gader them ayen togidre for\nto withdrawe them without ony losse.  And then the\noost began to be mevyd / and who best coude of the\npaynemys came to the medlee.  And whan the king\nperceyued that they cam with puyssaunce, he remysed\nhys folke togidre, and made to withdraw them al the\nlytil pas, and came behynde, the swerd in his\nfyst.  And whan he sawe a knight approuche, he retourned\n& made hym to recule abacke.  but yf he atteyned\nhym, he chastysed hym so that he no more had\nlangyng to siew hym.  And there the kynge dide so\nwel & so valyauntly, that euery one sayd he was\nmoche preu & worthy of his hand / and there ne was\nso hardy payneme that oo stroke durst abyde.  Then\ncame the Sawdan with a grete route of paynemes,\narmed on a grete hors, that held a dart\nenvenymed.  And thanne whan he aspyed the king, that so euyl\ndemened his folke, he cast at hym the darte yre, &\nhytte hym at the synester syde, in suche wyse that he\nperced hym thrugh & thrughe, For hys harneys coude\nneuer waraunt hym / And soone after the kyng felt\ngrete anguysshe, and drew the dart out of hys syde,\nand supposed to haue cast it agayn to the Sawdan / but\nthe Sawdan tourned hys hors so appertly that the dart\nfloug&hbar; besyde hym, & smote a payneme thrug&hbar; the\nbody in suche wyse that he fe&llbar; doune dede.  And\nwhan the sawdan, that ouermoche had auaunced hym self, wende to haue retourned, the kynge smote hym\nwith his swerd vpon the heed of hym, that he\nouerthrew hym to therthe.  Thenne cam the paynemes\nthere so strong that they made the kynge & hys folke\nto withdraw backe / and thenne was the sawdan\nredressed & remounted agayn vpon a grete hors.  And\nthenne was \u00fee prees grete, and the paynemes were\nstrong / in so moche that they made the kyng & his\nfolke to withdrawe vnto theire barrers.  Thanne bygan\nthe Cypryens, that kept the passage there, to shote &\nto launche on the paynemes so strong that they dyed\nthe place with the blood of theire enemyes.  but so\nstrong were the paynemys, that they gaynstode the\ncrysten / and also the king had lost moche of hys\nblood, & wexed feble, and hys folke bygane to be\nabasshed.  And how be it that the king suffred moche\ndolour & peyne, neuertheles he resioysshed moche hys\npeuple & encouraged them, and so moche they dide\nthat the fals paynemes might gete nothing on them /\nbut that they lost twyes asmoche more / and was\nthe scarmusshing moche fyers & peryllous.  And thus\nthe kyng of Cypre, by hys valyaunce & noble herte,\nrecomforted his folke.  and thoug&hbar; he felt grete peyne\n& woo, he fu&llbar; wel remysed hys folke into the\ntoune.  And it was grete meruay&llbar; how so grete a lord, wounded\nto the deth, myght sytte on horsbake / but the stroke\nwas no\u00feing morta&llbar; but for the venyme, For the dart\nwas envenymed / and wel it appered within a lytil\ntyme after, For he deyde of that same stroke.  but for\ncertayn he had the herte so full of valiauntnes, as the\nfaytte shewed it, that he ne dayned not make signe\nof eny bewayllyng before his folke, vnto tyme that one\nof the barons perceyued a&llbar; his senyster syde dyed with\nbloode / the whiche Baron sayd to the king: 'Sire,\nye abyde to long here / come & make your folke to\nwithdrawe them in to the toune or it be more late, For the nyght approucheth / to thende that your\nenmyes putte not them self thrughe the medlee emon&gtee;\nvs.'  The kyng, whiche felt grete sorowe, ansuerd to\nhym thus: 'Doo therof after your wylle.'  This knyght\nthenne made a houndred men of armes, that were\nreffresshed, to come before the barryere, & made to\nbygynne ayen the scarmusshing with an C crosbowe\nmen; and so were the paynemes sette abacke, wherof\nthe sawdan was fu&llbar; of grete anger, and escryed to\nhys folke: 'fourth lordes & barons, peyne your self\nto doo wel, For the toune shalbe oures this day: hit\nmay not escape vs.'  And thenne enforced ayen the\nmedlee.  And there ye had see wel assaylled &\nryght wel deffended, of that one part & of that\nother.  But whan the kinge of Cypre sawe that the paynemes\nstrengthed them soo, he toke courage grete, & ranne\nvpon them vygourously / and there he suffred so moche\npeyne \u00feat a&llbar; the synewes of hys body were open,\nwherof, as some sayen, his lyf was shorted / and by\nthat same enuahisshing were putte aback the paynemes,\n& many of them wer slayn & sore wounded.  The nyght\nthenne approuched, and was nygh / and grete harme\n& losse was there of bot&hbar; partes.  but alwayes the\npaynemes withdrew them vnto theire oost, For the\nking encouraged hys folk soo that they ne doubted no\nstroke nomore than yf \u00feey had be of yron or of\nstele.  And whan the paynems were departed, the kinge &\nhys folke retourned in to the toune.  And whan they\nknew the euyl auenture of theire king, they beganne to\nsorowe & to make grete dueil.  And the kynge, that\nsawe this, sayd to them: 'My good folke, make no\nsuche waymentin&gtee; ne sorowe, but thinke wel to\ndeffende you ayenst the Sawdan / and god our sauyour\nshalbe at your ayde & helpe, For yf it playse hym I\nsha&llbar; soone be heelid.'  Thenne was the peuple peased ayen.  but neuer\u00feeles, the kyng that said suche wordes\nfor to resioysshe hys peuple, felt in hym self that he\ncoude not escape fro deth.  And thenne he commanded\nto his folke they shuld make good watche, and gaf\nhem leue, & came to the palleys, and there alyghted\n& yede in to hys chambre / And thenne came hys\ndoughter, that somwhat had vnderstand of hys\nmysauenture.  but whan she perceyued that hys harneys\nwas a&llbar; rede with bloode, and sawe his wounde, she\nfe&llbar; doun in a swoune, & lay as she had be\ndeed.  Thenne commanded the kynge that she shuld be borne\nin to her chambre / and so it was doon.  After the\nCyrurgiens came to see the kingis wounde, and was\nleyed on his backe along his beed / and they told hym\nthat he was saaf fro pare&llbar; of deth, and that he shuld\nnot be abasshed.  'By my feyth,' said the kynge, 'I\nwote wel how it is with me / the wylle of god be doo /\nhit may not be kepte so secretly but that it shalbe knowen thrughe the Cyte.'  And thenne byganne \u00fee\nsorowe moche grete among the Cytezeyns & peple of\nthe Cyte, and more without comparacion than it was\nbyfore.  But here resteth thystorye of the kynge & of\nthe siege / and shal speke of Vryan and of his brother,\nand how they exployted afterward. / In this parte, saith thystorye, that on the morow\nerly, that was thursday, was Vryan after hys masse\nherde byfore hys tente / and there he made come,\none aftir other, a&llbar; the Captayns & chieftayns with\ntheire penons & standarts, and theire folke vnder them\nal armed of a&llbar; pieces, for to behold & vysyte theire\nharneys, yf eny thin&gtee; wanted / as wel the straungers /\nas hys owne folke / and beheld wel the mayntene &\ncontenaunce of them.  And after this was doo he\nmade them to be nombred / and they were founde by\nextymacion about ix. or ten thousaund fyghting\nmen.  Thenne said to them Vryan: 'Lyste, a&llbar; fayre lordes, we are here assembled for to susteyne the feyth of Jeshu\ncryste, of the whiche he vs alle hath regenered and\nsaued / as eche of vs knoweth wel ynoughe how he\nsuffred cruel deth for the loue of vs, to thende he\nshuld bye vs ayen fro the peynes of helle.  Wherfore\nlordis, seen & considered in our hertes that he hath\ndoon to vs suche a grace, we ought not to reffuse the\ndeth, or such auenture as he shal gyue vs, for to\ndeffende & susteyne the holy sacrements that he hath\nadmynystred vs for the saluacion of our sowles /\nthoug&hbar; that we now haue adoo with strong\npartye.  For our enmys ben tene ayenst one to the regarde of\nvs / but what therof we haue good ryght, For they\nare come to assayll vs without cause vnto our right\nherytage / and also we ought not to resoyngne ne\ndylaye therfore.  For Jhesu Criste toke alone the warre\nfor our redempcion, And by hys deth alle good folke\nthat kepen his comman- dements shal be saued.  ye\noughte thenne to vnderstand a&llbar; certaynly, that alle\nthoo that shu&llbar; dye in this quarelle, mayntenyng &\nenhaunsyng the feyth, shal be saued, & shal haue the\nglorye of Paradys / And \u00feerfore, fayre lordes, I tell you\nin genera&llbar; that I haue entencyon, god byfore, to meve\npresently for to approche our enemys, and to fyght\nwith them as soone as I may.  Wherfore, I praye you\nfrendly, that yf there be ony man in this place that\nfeleth not his herte ferme & stedfaste for to withstande\n& abyde thauenture, suc&hbar; as it shal playse to god to\nsend vs / that he withdrawe hym self apart fro other,\nFor by one only Cowarde & feynted herte is sometyme\nlefte & loste al a hoole werke.  and wete it that, al thoo\nthat wyl not comme with theire good wy&llbar;, as wel of\nmy folke as of other, I sha&llbar; gyue them money ynoughe & syluer for theyre sustenaunce & fyndyng\nfor to passe ouer the see ayen.'  After these wordes he\nmade hys banere to be dressed a bowe shote fro the\nvaley, vpon the mounteyne, and ordeyned hys brother\nGuyon for to hold & bere it / and after he said, al on\nhye, in heryng of hys folke / 'A&llbar; they that entenden,\n& haue deuocion for to auenge the deth of Jeshu\ncriste, to thenhaunsyng of the holy feyth cristen, Also\nto ayde & helpe the kynge of Cypre, lete hym\nwithdrawe hym self vnder my banere / and they that ben\nof contrary wy&llbar;, lete them passe ouer at the o\u00feer syde\nof the bridge.'  Thanne whan the noble hertes herde\nhym saye thoo wordes. they held it to grete wysedome\nof hym, & of grete prowesse & worthynes, & went alle\nin a companye togider vnder his banere, wepyng for\nJoye & for pyte of the wordes that Vryan had said /\nne none delayed ne taryed for nothing, but yede a&llbar;\nvnder hys banere, as said is / Thenne was moche\ngladde Vryan, and joyous, and anone he made his\ntrompettes to be blowen vp, and all was troussed &\nputte them self on theire way.  And thanne the maister of Rodes, and the Captayne of Lymasson\nputte them self assembled togidre, and rode in fayre\nbatay&llbar;, And said wel that ayenst Vryan and his folke\nno man shal endure / And thus they rode tyl they\ncame nygh to the mountayne / and as half way to the\nplace where the batay&llbar; had be the day byfore.  'By\nmy feyth, lordes,' sayd  Vryan, 'there nygh that yond\nryuere were good that we went to be there lodged tyl\nwe were refresshed.  And in the meane while we shal\nsee and aduyse how we sha&llbar; for the moost surest way\nhyndre & adommage our enmyes' / And they ansuerd\nthat so was good to doo.  They went thenne a&llbar; togider,\nto thende they were not founde abrode, & lodged \u00feem\nself there.  Now leueth here of them thystorye / and\nbygynneth to speke of the Sawdan. / Thystorye sayth that the Saudan had hys espyes\nwithin the Cite, whiche aspyed secretly \u00fee\nConvyne of them of the toune.  Wherby he knew that\nsocours & help came to the kyng / and also how\nthe kyng was sore wounded, wherof the peuple was\ngretly troubled.  Thanne had the sawdan cause to do\nassay&llbar; the toune / and he made to blowe trompettes\nwhan \u00fee sonne was vp, and ordeyned his bataylles, and\nhis Crosbowes & paueys, and came vnto the dyches &\nbarryers.  There bygan the scarmusshing outrageously\nfyers / they shotte with Crosbowes demesurably of one\npart & of other.  There were many paynemes slayn,\nFor they within the toune shotte many gonnes, &\ncast vpon them fro the batelments of theire walles\ngrete stones, pyche & grece brennyng hoot, and reuersed\nthem fro the ladders vnto the botome of the\ndyches.  Thenne came the Sawdan fourth, cryeng with a high\nvoys, 'Now, lordes, deffende yourself worthily, & lete\nvs take toune or ony socours come to our enemyes,\nFor on my god Machomete, he that first sha&llbar; entre the toune, I sha&llbar; gyue hym hys pesaunnt or weyght\nof syluer in suche estate as he entre in to\nit.'  Who thenne had see them assaylle & cleme vp to the\nwalles, and putte them self in parellous passage, he\nshuld haue be meruaylled.  But they that were vpon\nthe walles within, fourth cast on them grete logges of\nwode, brennyng oyle, lede molten / tonnes & barels\nfu&llbar; of vnquynched lyme, and vesselles fu&llbar; of flaxe\ngrecyd with oyle and mixtyouned with brymstone and\nsulfer, al ardaunt & brennyng / so that magre them\nthey were fayn to relenquysshe the place, and to\nremounte at another syde of the wa&llbar;: and there abode many paynemys al brent and sore hurt.  And\nthanne the Sawdan made thassawte to be strengthed\nwith new folke / but they within forth deffended them\nful valyauntly as preu & hardy.  Also they were more\nvygourous of herte, for that they knew theire socours\ncommyyng, that was nygh.  Here I shall leue of \u00feis\nmatere / and shal say how Vryan dide, whiche had\nsent hys espyes to knowe how it was of the siege / And\nthey reported to hym how the saudan gaaf grete &\ncontynuel sawtes to the Cite / and that without shortly\nit were socoured, they were within in grete daunger /\nand how the kynge was syke & sore wounded.  Whan\nvryan and Guyon vnderstode these tydynges, they were\nwithin them self wel angry and fylled with sorowe /\nbut no grete semblaunt they made of it, to thende\ntheire folke shuld not be of lesse courage therfore. /", "22": "Cap. XXII. How the Sawdan was slayn byfore Famagoce. In this parte sayth thystorye, that whan Vryan herde\nthe tydynges forsaid, he made to sowne his\ntrompettes, and made thoost to be armed, and departed it\nin foure bataylles; wherof of the first batay&llbar; he\nhymself was conductour, hys brother lede the seconde, the\nmaister of Rodes was Chieftayn of the iii de ; And the\nfoureth was conduyted & lede by the Captayn of\nLymas.  And he made to abyde in the valey a&llbar; the\nsommage, and mad it to be kept with a houndred men\nof armes and fyfty cros bowemen.  And after they\nbygane to mounte the hille, And fro thens they sawe\nhow the paynemes assaylled moche strongly the\nCite.  And thenne Vryan said to his folke / 'Lordes, that\nfolke is of grete nombre / but no doubte they be oures / and god before they shalbe dyscomfyted by vs / and\nthat right soone.  goo we thenne ayenst theire oost /\nand so fourth without dylayeng to them that sawten\nthe Cite. and I wene with goddis grace that they\nshal not endure long ayenst vs.'  And they ansuerd,\n'that good it was for to doo soo.'  Thenne he wold\ndescende the mountayne and haue passed at back syde\nof the oost; but whan they supposed to haue passed\nfourth, the paynemes perceyued that they were not of\ntheire folke / they cryed alarme and were sore\naferd.  Thanne sayd Vryan to the Captayn, that with a&llbar; his\nbatai&llbar; he shuld entre thoost to fight ayenst them that\nwere there.  There bygan a mortal medlee, And Vryan\nand the other two bataylles yede ferther, & putte them\nself atwix the watche & them that assaylled the Cite /\nand so long they sawted, that alle they that kepte theire\nlodgis and of \u00feeire watche were slayn and dystroyed,\nand incontynent a&llbar; the foure bataylles in  fayre\nordynaunce marched fourth toward the other that strongly\nassaylled.  But one came to the sawdan, and said to\nhym how the tentes & pauyllons were take, and alle\nthey that kepte them slayn / 'and they that haue doon\n\u00feat faytte, ye may see them commyng hitherward, the\nmoost strong and fe&llbar; folke that euer I sawe ne herde\nspeke of.'  The saudan thanne loked abacke, and sawe\nbaners & standarts and hys enmyes commyng in fayre\nordynaunce / and so nygh togider that they semed not\nin nombre to be as moche by the half as they\nwere.  Thenne was the Saudan abasshed and wood angry / and\nmade to sowne hys trompette to withdrawe & assemble\nhis folke togider.  But or they were half assembled,\nVryan came first with hys batay&llbar; / and with a grete\ncourage ran vpon them moche asprely, And \u00feer began\nthoccysyon & slaghter moche grete / but for certayn the\ngretest losse tourned on the paynemes, For they had\nno leser for to putte them self in aray of baytaylle, and were sore wery of thassawte / & none of them were\nvnder his banere whan Vryan and his folke ranne vpon\nthem, whiche were aspre & harde and fu&llbar; wel wyst\nthe crafte of armes, wherfore many of the paynemes\nputte them self to flight.  But the sawdan, that was ful\nof grete courage & of grete vasselage, realyed his folke\nabout hym, & delyuered & gaf ryght a grete sawte to\nour folke moche proudly.  There were many men slayn\n& sore wounded / and made hym self to be redoubted\nand dradde, For he held a two handes ax / and smote\nwith at lyfte syde and at the ryght syde that none\nmyght susteyne hys strokes that were about\nhym.  But whan Vryan perceyued hym \u00feat so sore demened\nhis folke, he was fu&llbar; woo, and said in hymself, 'By my\nfeyth, it is grete pyte & dommage that yonder Turcke\nbyleueth nat on god, For he is moche preu & valyaunt\nof his hand; but for the dommage that I see he doeth\non my folke, I ne haue cause to forbere hym ony more /\nand also we be not in place where grete & many wordes\nmay be holden.'  Thenne he braundysshed hys swerd\nand with a fyers contenaunce rane vpon the Saudan /\nAnd whan he sawe hym commyng he refused hym not,\nbut toke his ax and wende to haue smyten vryan withal\nvpon the crosse of the heed / but Vryan eschiewed\nthe stroke; the ax was pesaunt and heuy, and with that\nvayne stroke it scaped fro the Saudans handes.  And\nthanne Vryan smote hym vpon the helmet a grete\nstroke with all his might / and was the sawdan so sore\ncharged with that stroke that he was so astonyed and\namased that he neyther sawe nor herde, and lost the\nbrydel and the steropes, and the hors bare hym where\nhe wold.  And Vryan pursiewed hym nygh, and yet\nagayn atteyned hym with his trenchaunt swerde betwix\nthe heed & the sholders, For his helmet was a&llbar; vnlaced\nand his hawtepyece fe&llbar; of with the forsaid stroke,\nwherfore with his second stroke vryan made hys swerde to entre in the sawdants flesshe, in so moc&hbar; that he\ndetrenched & cutte the two maister vaynes of his nek,\nand fe&llbar; doune fro hys hors to the erthe.  And there\nwas so grete prees of horses of one parte and of other,\nthat the stoure of batay&llbar; was there so aspre and so\nmorta&llbar; that hys folke might not help hym / and lost\nso moche of hys blood that he most there deye in grete\ndystres & sorowe / And soone after that the paynemes\nknew that the saudan was deed they were affrayed and\nmoche abasshed, and neuer aftir they fought with no\ngood herte.  Thanne Vryan and his brother Guyon\nesprouued themself there, & faught so strongly, gyuyng\ngrete & pesaunt strokes, that wonder it was to\nsee.  And wete it wel \u00feat bothe Cypryens & Poytevyns dide\nso valyauntly that in short space of tyme they dystroyed\ntheyre enmyes, whiche were a&llbar; slayn or take.  And\nthenne Vryan & his folke lodged them self in the\npaynems lodgys / and was the sommage of the cristen sent\nfore / and the gardes and kepers of it, fayne & glad of\nthe vyctory, came & brought it in to thoost and lodged\nthere / And the two brethern made the Butyn or\nconqueste to departe & deele so egaly after euery man had\ndeseruyd & was worthy, \u00feat none there was but he\nwas fu&llbar; of Joye & content of it / And here resteth\nthystorye of Vryan / and shal speke of the capytayne\nof Lymas, that soone came to Famagoce. In this parte tellet&hbar; vs thistorye that after \u00fee\ndyscomfyture of the batay&llbar; the Captayne departed\nfro the two brethern, with hym xxx knightes of grete\naffayre, and came to the Cite, where the yates were\nopend to hym gladly, and entred and found the folke\nby the stretes, of whiche some made grete feeste, for\n\u00feat they sawe them delyuered of theire enemyes, and\nblessid the heure that euer the children of Lusignen\nwere borne, and the heure also whan they entred the land.  And some folke made grete sorowe, grete\nwepynges, sore lawmentyn&gtee;, and grete bewayllin&gtee;, for\ntheire kynge \u00feat was wounded to the deth.  Wherfore\nhe wyst not what to thinke, For he knew not yet the\nkyng was hurt.  And so moche he exployted that he\ncame to the palleys, and there he alighted, where he\nfound the peuple wel mate / and he demanded of them\nwhat they ayled, and yf they wanted of eny thing.  'By\nmy feyth,' said one of them, 'ye / and that ynoug&hbar;;\nFor we lese the moost true & valyaunt man that euer\nwas borne in this royalme.'  'How thanne,' said the\nCaptayn, 'is the kynge syke?'  'Ha / a! sire,' ansuered\nto hym a knight, 'knowe you no more of it?  We dide\nyssue yesterday, and enuahysshed our enmyes / and\nat retourne of it the sawdan smote our king with a\nvenymous darte, by so that no remedye nys founde\ntherto / For we supposed euer that these two\ndamoyseaulx had come to our ayde & help at that day,\nAnd wete it that the kingis doughtir demeneth suche\nheuynes & sorowe, that grete pyte it is to see, For\nalmost two dayes are passed that she ete no manere of\nmete / woo & euylhap shalbe to vs yf lese bot&hbar; our\nking & our damoyselle & lady, For yf that happed the\nland were in grete orphanite of bothe lord & of\nlady.'  'Fayre lordes,' said the Captayne, 'a&llbar; is not yet lost\nthat lyeth in pare&llbar;.  Haue lost in our lord Jhesu Criste,\nand he shall helpe you.  I pray you lede me toward\nthe king.'  'By my feyth' / said the knight, 'that\nsha&llbar; soone be doo, For he lyth in the next chambre,\nwhere euery man may goo as he had no harme / He\nhath alredy made hys testament, & hath ordeyned &\nbequethed of hys owne good to his seruaunts, so that\neuery one is content / and he is confessed & hath\nreceyued our lord, and he is admynystred of a&llbar; his\nrightes & sacrements.'  'By my feyth,' said the Captayne, 'he is thanne in good caas / and he hath doon as\na wyse man oughte to doo' / And thenne he entred in\nto the Chambre & enclyned hym self byfore the kyng\nthat leye on his beed, and made to hym the\nreuerence.  'Captayne,' said the kinge, 'ye be right welcome /\nand I thanke you of the good diligence that ye haue\ndoo to haue accompanyed these two noble men by\nwhome my land is out of the subgection of the\npaynemes, For I had no more puyssaunce to gouerne my\nfolke ne my land / I pray you that ye goo & telle\nthem on my behalf that \u00feey vouchesaaf to come &\nsee me or I be deed, For grete wylle I haue to make\nsatisfaction to them to my power of the loue &\ncurtoysye that they haue shewed to me; And also I haue\ngrete desyre to see & speke with them, for certayn caas\nwhiche I wyl declare vnto them.'  'My lord,' said the\nCaptayne, 'gladly I shall doo your\ncommandement.'  'Now gooth thenne,' said the kynge, '& lete hem be to\nmorne with me by the houre of pryme.'  The kinge\nthanne commanded that the grete strete where they\nshuld passe shuld be hanged richely vnto the paleys,\nand dyde doo make grete appareyl ayenst theire\ncommyng.  And here resteth thistory to speke of the\nking / and retourneth to saye of the Captayne. Thistorye saith that so fast rode the Captayne that\nsoone he came to the oost, and alighted at the tente of the two brethern, that moche humbly receyued\nhym.  And thenne he recounted to them how the king\nwas sore hurt / and that affectuelly he prayed them\nthat they vouchesaaf to come toward hym, so that he\nmight thanke them of the noble socours that they\nhad doon to hym, and to make satisfaction to them of\ntheyre peyne & dyspens to his power, and also for to\nspeke with them of other matere.  'By my feyth,' said\nUryan, 'we are not come hither for to take sawdees ne for no syluer / but only to susteyne & enhaunse the\ncatholique feyth.  And we wol wel \u00feat euery man\nknowe that we haue hauoyr & syluer ynoug&hbar; for to pay\nour folke / but alway we right gladly sha&llbar; goo toward\nhym.  And wete it that I purpose to goo toward the\nking in suche a state as I departed fro the batay&llbar;; For\nyf he vouchesaaf I wyl receyue of hym the ordre of\nknighthode for the valyaunce & honour that euery man\nsayth of hym.  And ye, Captayn, ye may goo and telle\nhym that to morne at that houre he hath poynted\nbothe my brother and I and the maister of Rodes, god\nbefore, we shal be toward hym, and a houndred of our\nmoost high barons with vs.'  Thenne toke leue the\nCaptayne and came to the Cite, where he was receyued\nmoc&hbar; honourably / and soone he came to the paleys,\nwhere he fonde the kynge in also good poynte as he\nlefte hym.  And there was his doughter Ermyne, that\nwas fu&llbar; of sorowe for the euyl of her fader / but\nthat notwithstanding she recomforted her self moche of\nthis that men said to her, that the two damoyseaulx\nshuld come there.  And wete it that she moche desyred\nto see Uryan.  And thenne the Captayne salued the kyng.\n'Ye be right welcomme,' said the kinge / 'what tydinges\nbryng you of youre message / shal I not see that two\ngentil damoyseaulx?'  'Sire, ye,' said the Captayne /\n'they and houndred more with them / and playse you\nto knowe that they wil haue no recompense of you /\nFor as they saye they be not sawdyours for siluer / but\n\u00feey name them self sawdyours of our lord Jeshu\ncriste.  And so moche, sire, hath told me Uryan / that to\nmorne, god before, or it be fullysshe pryme, he shal\ncome toward you in suche a poynt & state as he\ncame fro the baytaylle; For he wyl receyue thordre\nof cheualrye and to be dowbed knight of your\nhand.'  'By my feyth,' said the kyng, 'I lawde our lord\nJeshu Criste, whan before my dayes be termyned, it playseth hym that I make & dowbe knight one so valyaunt &\nhye prynce / and wete it I shal therfore deye betre at\nease.'  And whan Ermyne herd of these tydinges she\nhad so grete joye therfore in her herte, that she coulde\nnot holde her coutenaunce ne manere / but therof she\nmade no grete semblaunt, but shewed to haue grete\nsorowe woo in her herte.  She toke thanne leue of\nher fader / and sore weping kyssed hym moche swetly /\nand she went into her chambre / and there she bygan\nto bewaylle her self sore / one houre for the doulour &\nwoo that she had for her fader / and another heure for\nthe grete joye & desyre that she had of the sight of\nVryan, whos taryeng enjoyed her moche / & moche\nlong she was in thoughte so argued and vexed therwith\na&llbar;, that a&llbar; that night she coude not slepe / In this parte saith thistory, that on the morne erly\nthe king commanded that a&llbar; noble and vnnoble\nshuld make theire houses to be appareylled & hanged\nwithout forth euery one after his power, for to make feste\n& honour at the commyng of the two brethern and of\ntheyre folke / and that at euery corner of a strete shuld\nbe trompettes and other dyuerse Instruments of musyque\nmaking grete melodye / And for certayn the peuple\nendeuoyred them self wel / ye / more than the kynge had\ncommanded to be doo.  What shuld I make long\nprologue / the two brethern within pryme came mounted\nmoche nobly vpon two grete coursers / and Vryan was\nal armed, euen so as whan he came fro the batay&llbar;,\nthe swerd naked in his fyst.  And Guyon, hys brother,\nhad on a gown of fyn clothe of damaske, rychely\nfourred / and byfore them rode thretty of the moost\nhye barons in noble aray / and nygh to them was the\nmaister of Rodes and the Captayn of Lymas.  And\nafter the two bretheren came & folowed nygh thre\nscore & ten knightes and theire squyers & pages in her\ncompanye / and in fayre aray they entred in to the Cyte.  There had ye seen the feste begynne moc&hbar;\ngrete / and the trompettes & menestrels dooyn&gtee; theire\ncrafte / And thrugh the stretes had ye sene folke of\ngrete honour that were moche wel and richely clothed,\nwhiche cryed with a hye voys / 'ha / a welcomme be ye,\nprynce vyctoryous, of whom we hold and are a&llbar;\nsuscited of the cruel seruytude & boundage of thenemyes\nof our lord Jeshu Cryst.'  There had ye see ladyes &\ndamoyselles at wyndowes in grete nombre / and\nthauncyent gentylman & burgeys were merueylled of the\ngrete fyerste of the noble Vryan, that was al armed,\nthe vysage dyscouered / a grene garland on his hed,\nan the swerd in his fyst.  And the captain bare\nbyfore hym hys helmet on a tronchon of a spere.  And\nwhan they perceyued his fyers visage they said\nbetwene them self togidre / 'that man is able and shappen\nfor to subdue & putte vndre hym a&llbar; the world.'  'By\nmy feyth,' said the other, 'he sheweth it wel, For he\nis entred into this toune lyke as he had conquerd it.'\n'In name of god,' said other / 'the rescue of the\ndaunger of whiche he hath kept vs fro is worth & ynoug&hbar;\nfor a conqueste.'  'Certaynly,' said other, 'thaugh his\nbrother hath not so fyers a face, yet he semeth to be\nman of wele & of faytte.'  And so talkyng of one thing\n& of other they conueyed \u00feem vnto the paleys, where\nthey alighted.  And here resteth thystorye to speke\nony more of the peuple / and bygynneth to speke how\nthe two brethern came byfore the king /", "23": "Cap. XXIII. How Vryan & Guyon came byfore the kinge, he beying in his bed syke. Thystorye sayth now that the two bre\u00feern moche\nhonourably came & made the reuerens to the\nkinge / and the kinge receyued them joyously / and\nthanked them moche gracyously of theire ayde & socours/ and said to them / that after god / they were they by\nwhom he & al his reaume was suscited fro the moost\ncruel passage, & more fel \u00fean eny deth, For yf they\nhad not be, the paynemys had dystroyed them a&llbar; /\nor had constrayned to be conuerted to theire fals lawe,\nwhiche had be to vs wers & heuyer than ony deth\ncorpora&llbar;.  For they that to it had consented with herte,\nthey had had for euermore dampnacion eternel / 'And\ntherefore,' said the kyng, 'it is rayson that I rewarde\nyou to my power, For I haue none other wylle than to\nendeuoyre me \u00feerto / how be it certayn that I may\nnot acomplysshe to the regarde of the grete honour\nthat ye haue me shewed / but lowly & humbly I\nbeseche you to take in worthe my lytil puyssaunce.'\n'By my feyth,' said Vryan, 'of this ye ought not to\ndoubte / For we be not come hither neyther to haue\nof you gold nor syluer / ne of your tounes, castels, ne\nlandes / but only to seke honour and for to dystroye\nthenemyes of god, and to exalte the feyth catholical /\nand I wil, sire, that ye knowe that we hold our peyne\nwel employed, yf ye vouchesaaf to doo vs so moche of\nhonour that ye wyl dowbe my brother & me knightes\nof your hand.'  'By my feyth,' said the king, 'noble\ndamoyseaulx, in asmoche as I am not worthy to\nacomplysshe your requeste, I consent to it / but first sha&llbar;\nthe masse be said.'  'Sire,' said Vryan, 'tha me semyth\nwel doon.'  And thanne the chapellayne was soone\nredy.  And thenne Vryan, hys brother, and a&llbar; other\ndeuoutly herde the messe & the seruyse deuyne, And\nafter the deuyne seruyse Vryan came tofore the king.\nAnd thenne he drew the swerde out of the shede &\nkneled doun byfore the kyng, where he laye, and sayd\nto hym in this manere: 'Sire, I requyre you, for alle\nthe salary of my seruyce that I haue doo or may doo\nin tyme to come, that ye vouchesaf to dowbe me\nknight with this swerde / and so shu&llbar; ye haue wel rewarded me of a&llbar; that ye say that my brother & I\nhaue doo for you and for your realme; For of the hand\nof a more valyaunt knyght and noble lord, I ne may\nreceyue the ordre of knighthede / than of yours.'  'By\nmy feyth,' said the kinge / 'damoyseau, ye shew me\nmore honour than ye owe me / and ye say moche more\nof me than euer I deserued.  but sene I considered\nthat grete honour is to me to dowbe you knight, I am\nagreable therto / but after that I haue acomplysshed\nyour requeste, ye sha&llbar; couuenaunt with me yf it\nplayse you to graunte me a yefte, the whiche shal not\ntourne you neyther to preiudice ne dommage, but only\nto your ryght grete prouffyt & honour.'  'By my feyth,'\nsaid Uryan, 'I am redy therto to acomplysshe your wille\n& playsire.'  Thenne had the kynge grete joye, and\ndressyng hym to sytte vp, and toke the swerde by the\npomel that Uryan toke hym, and therwith dowbed hym\nknyght, sayeng, in this manere / 'In the name of god,\nI adoube you & admytte you into thordre of a knyght,\nprayeng god to putte from you a&llbar; euy&llbar;.'  And \u00feenne\ngaf hym the swerd ayen, and thus makyng his wounde\nopend, and out of it ranne blood thrugh the wraper,\nwherof Vryan was sory & woo, and so were a&llbar; other\nthat sawe hym; but thenne the kyng layed hym self\nayen along in his bed sodaynly, and said he felt none\neuy&llbar;.  And after he commanded two knightes that\nthey shuld fetche hys doughter / and they dide soo /\nand brought her at mandement of her fader.  And\nwhan the kyng sawe her, he said thus / 'My doughter\nthank & remercye these noble men of thayde and\nsocoure that they haue doon to me & to you bothe, and\nalso to a&llbar; our realme, For yf had not be the grace of\ngod & theire strengthe & puyssaunce we had be a&llbar;\ndystroyed, or at leste exilled out of our land / or ellis\nvs to haue be conuertid to theire fals lawe that had be\nwers and more importable to vs than to suffre deth tempora&llbar;' / And thenne she kneled byfore the two\nbretheren & salued them, & thanked moche humbly\nAnd wete it that she was in suche manere commouyd\nas she had be rauysshed, and wyst not how to hold\ncontenaunce, what for the woo & sorowe that she had\nat her herte of thanguysshe that her fader felt / as of\nthe thoughtes that she toke for Uryan, in so moche\nthat she was as a personne that is awaked newly fro\nher dreme.  But thenne vryan, that wel perceyued that\nshe had her spiryte troubled, toke her vp ryght swetely,\nand enclyned hymself byfore her, makyn&gtee; moche\nreuerence eche of them to other / and where as they\nof the countre said / 'yf this noble man had take\noure damoyselle to his lady wel it shuld come to passe,\nFor thenne we shuld drede neyther payneme nor man\nthat wold doo vs hurt.'  And thenne called the kyng\nhis doughtir, and to her said thus: 'My doughtir,\nsette you here by me, For I deme that ye shall not\nlong hold me company.'  And she thanne wepyng satte\nherself by hym.  And thanne a&llbar; they that were there\nbygan to sorowe & wepe for the pyte they had of the\nkyn&gtee;, And also of the sorow that they sawe the virgyne,\nhis doughter, made so pitously. Thystory telleth vs that the kyng was sorowfu&llbar;\nwhan he sawe hys doughter take suc&hbar; heuynes,\nand thenne he said amyably: 'My doughtir, lete be\nyour heuynes and your grete doulour that ye take, I\npray you, For that thing that may not be amended it\nis folye to make therof grete sorowe / notwithstandyng\nit is raison naturel that eueryche creature be\nsorowfu&llbar; for hys frend & neyghbour whan that he lesith\nhym.  but, and it playse god, I shal puruey for you\nso that ye shal hold you content, or I departe fro this\nmortal worl&dtail;, and so sha&llbar; a&llbar; the baronye of my\nrealme' / And \u00feenne bygan the mayde to wepe more haboundauntly than she dide to fore, And also all the\nbarons demened suche woo & sorowe that it was\npyteous for to see / but vryan and guyon were sorowfullest\nof a&llbar;.  and the kyng perceyuyn&gtee; theire doulour, he\nsaid to them: 'Fayre doughter, and you, vryan and\nguyon, this sorowe is not necessary to you, For\ntherwith I preuaylle not nor you neyther in no manere /\nbut it augmenteth my doulour, wherfore I you\ncommande that ye cesse of this heuynes yf ye loue me,\nand to haue me yet with you here alyue a lytil space\nof tyme.'  And thenne they bygan to cesse theyre\ndoulour in theire best manere, for the wordes that the\nkyn&gtee; to them said.  And ouer that spake the kynge\nhym self dressyng to vryan, and thus said: 'Sire\nknyght, thankyng be to you, ye c&omacr;uenaunted with me\na yefte whiche I purpose now to take / and \u00feat shal\nneyther touche your cheuaunce nor honour.'  'By my\nfeyth,' sayd Vryan, 'demande what it playse you, For\nyf it be of that thing wherof I haue power I shal fulfy&llbar;\nit voluntarily.' 'Gramercy sire,' sayd the kynge, 'wete\nit that by this that I shal demande of you, shal retourne\nto you a noble thin&gtee;.  Now, sire knight, I pray you\nthat it may playse you to take my doughter in\nmaryage, and a&llbar; my royalme with her / And fro this tyme\nfourth I gyue you fu&llbar; possessyon therof to doo\ntherwith your prouffyt' / And wel veray & trouth it is that\nhe had doo brought there the crowne / and with these\nwordes he took it, & said / 'hold, Vryan, ne reffuse\nnot my requeste that I desyre of you.'  Thenne were\nthe barons of the land so joyous that teeris fel fro\ntheire eyen for pyte & joye that they had therof.  And\nwhan Vryan vnderstode these wordes, he called a lytel\nremembraunce / and wete it wel he was sorowfu&llbar; &\ndolaunt therof.  For he was wyllyng to seke the straunge\ncountrees of the world and poursiewe for honour.  But\nalwayes for as moche as he was accorded with the kynge of the yefte, he wold not gaynsaye it / And whan the\nbarons sawe hym so pensefu&llbar; they cryed al with a hye\nvoyce ryght pyteously / 'ha / a then, noble man, wilt\nthou reffuse the kinges requeste?'  'By my feyth, lordes\n& barons,' said Uryan, 'no more shal I doo.'  Thenne\nenclyned Uryan byfore the kyng wher he laye, and\ntoke the croune and putte it in Ermynes lap, sayeng /\n'Damoyselle, it is your, and sith it hath fortuned thus\nwith me, I sha&llbar; you helpe to kepe it my lyf naturel,\nyf it playse god ayenst al them that wold vsurpe it or\nputte it in subgection.'  Thenne was the kinge joyful\nand glad, & so were al the barons.  And after he dide\nmake come the archebysshop of the Cite that asuryd\nthem togidre.  But Ermyne said she wold see first\nthe termynacion of her faders syknes or she shuld\nprocide ony ferther.  Thanne said Vryan, 'damoyselle,\nsith that it playseth you to doo so I am agreable therto.'\nThenne was the kyng woofu&llbar; & dolaunt, and said:\n'Fayre doughter Ermyne, ye shew wel \u00feat lytel ye loue\nme, whan that thinge whic&hbar; I desire moost to see afore\nmyn ende ye ne wyl acomplysshe.  Now wel I see\nthat ye desyre my deth.'  Whan \u00fee mayde vnderstode\nhym she was ryght dolaunt & sorowfu&llbar; / and wepyng\nkneeled byfore the king, hir fader, and said in this\nmanere: 'My right redoubted lord & fader / there nys\nthing in the world that I shuld reffuse you vnto myn\nowne deth / commande you me your playsire.'  'Ye\nsay now,' said the king, 'as a true doughtir ought to\nsay, that is wylling for to kepe her fader from wrathe\n& fyre.  I now thanne commande you that ye leue\nyour sorowe, and lete this halle to be dressid and with\nryche clothes hanged, and make the masse to be said /\nand aftir the deuyne seruise do make the tables to be\ncouered, and after dyner make here byfore me the feste\nas that I were now on my feet; For wete it wel / that\nshal helpe & comforte me wel.'  And thenne they a&llbar; endeuoyred them self to fulfy&llbar; this that he\ncommanded.  Thenne was the masse said, and sate them\nself at dyner / & Ermyne was sette at a table that was\nlayed byfore her faders bedd / and Vryan with her,\nAnd Guyon serued Ermyne of mete.  Thanne had the\nking grete joye, but he made betre semblaunt than his\nherte was of power, For certayn what chere that he\nmade he felt grete peyne & grete dolour, For the venym\nthat was within the wounde caused grete putrefyeng &\nrotyng of his flesshe / but for to rejoye the baronnye\nhe made no semblaunt of no sorow ne douleur / and\nafter dyner bygan the feest, and lasted til nyght came.\nThe king thanne called to hym vryan, and said, 'Fayre\nsone, I wyl ye wedde my doughter to morne, and I\nwyl delyuere vnto you the Crowne and Ceptre of this\nrealme, For wete it I may not long be alyue.\nWherfore I wil that alle the barons of \u00feis land make theire\nhomage to you byfore my deth.'  'Sire,' said vryan,\n'sith that playseth you / your wylle & myne be one' /\nAnd there was Ermyne present \u00feat refussed not to\nfulfylle her faders wy&llbar;.", "24": "Cap. XXIV. How Vryan espoused Ermyne, doughter vnto the kinge of Cypre. ON the morne next, about the hooure of tierce, was\nthe spouse appareylled & rychely arayed, and the\nchappe&llbar; nobly hanged with riche cloth of gold, And\nthe Archebysshop of Famagoce espoused them there.\nAnd after came Vryan before the kyng that toke the\nCrowne, and ther witha&llbar; crouned vryan, that moche\nof thankes rendred to the kynge therfore.  Thenne\ncalled the king to hym a&llbar; the barons of \u00fee lande / and\ncommanded them to make theire hommage to kyng\nVryan, his sone / and they voluntarily dide soo.  And\nthe masse than bygan, and after it was doo they satte at dyner / and syn bygan the feste right grete, and\nendured tyl euen / and after souper begane ayen the\nfeste / and whan tyme was the spouse was lede to\nbed / and anone aftir Vryan layed hym self by her /\nand the bysshop came & halowed the bed / And so\nthenne a&llbar; departed / some went to bed / and some\nretourned ayen for to daunce.

And thither was the\nqueene conueyed & lede of guyon her brother, and by\none of the moost highe barons of the lande. In this parte sheweth vs thistorye, that on \u00fee next\nmorne after about the hooure of pryme, kyng vryan\nacompanyed with the baronnye of poytou and of the\nroyalme of Cipre, came byfore the king and enclyned\nhym self & salued hym right humbly.  'Fayre sone, ye\nbe welcome,' said the kyng.  'I am fu&llbar; joyous of your\ncommyng / make my doughter to come, so shul we\nhere the deuyne seruyse.'  Thenne came his doughtir\nErmyne, wel nobly acompanyed of many ladyes &\ndamoyselles / and she come byfore her fader & salued\nhym full humbly.  Thenne said he to her: 'My wel\nbeloued doughter, ye be welcome.  I am right wel\njoyous whan god hath don to me suche a grace, that I have\npurueyed you of so hye a prynce & worthy knyght to\nyour lord / and wete it that therfore I shal dey more\neasely sith that you and al my land is out of the\ndaunger of the paynemes, and no doubte ye haue to\nyour protection and wraunt a prynce worthy & valyaunt,\nthat right wel shal kepe and defende you ayenst a&llbar;\nyour euyl willers, and in especial anenst thinfideles &\nenemys of Ieshucrist.'

And with these or semblable wordes he\nshette hys eyen and departed fro this mortal lyf so\nswetly that they supposed that he had be aslepe /\nBut whan they were certayn of his deth the douleur\n& sorowe bygan to be grete.  Thenne was Ermyne had\nin to her Chambre, For she demened suc&hbar; sorowe that\ngrete pite it was to see.  The kynge thenne was buryed\nand his obsequyes doon ryally, and in the moost\nhonourable guyse that coude be deuysed after the vse and\ncustome of the land.  And wete it that a&llbar; the peple\nwas sorowfu&llbar; & dolaunt; but they took comfort of\nthis, that they had founde & recouered a lord ful of so\ngrete prowesse as Vryan was / and lytel & lytil cessed\nthe lawmenting & heuynes.  And soone after yede\nVryan thrugh al his realme to see and visite the places\n& fortres / and betoke one part of his folke to Guyon,\nhis brother / and another part to the maister of Rodes,\nand made them to be shipped on the see, for to wete &\nknowe, for to here & knowe yf they shuld here ony\ntydynges that paynemes were on the see for to lande in\nhis lande.  'For wete it wel,' said the kin&gtee; vryan,\n'that we purpose ne think not to abyde vnto tyme\nthey fetche vs, For we sha&llbar; god before goo & vysyte\nthem within short tyme, after that we haue ouerseen\nthe rule & gouernaunce of our land.'

And here\nleueth thistorye of them / and bygynneth to shewe how\nVryan & Ermyne went and vysited theire land. Thystory saith that king Vryan, with Ermyne hys\nwyf, yede & vysited theire land al about, and\nfu&llbar; gladly & honourably they were receyued in euery\nburghe, toune, & Cite where they passed / and grete\nyeftes were presented to them / And wete it that Vryan\npurueyed ryght wel to a&llbar; hys fortres, of a&llbar; suche\nthinges that were necessary for the werre yf some\nthing befe&llbar; in tyme to come.  And for trouth euery\none was meruaylled of his heyght, of his fyersnes, &\nof his puyssaunce & strengthe of body.  And wel said\nthe men of the Countree, that ferdfu&llbar; & daungerous\nthing was to cause his wrath & anger.  And thus went\nVrian fro place to place thrughe his royalme.  And\nsuche officers that made rayson & kept justice, he lefte\nthem in their offices stil / but to al o\u00feer that o\u00feerwyse\ndide than right requyreth, he purueyed of remede by\ngood & meure deliberacion of his counsei&llbar;.  And\ncommanded euery one to make raison & Justice in al tymes,\nas wel to the leste as to the moost, without to bere eny\nfauour to ony of eyther partye / and yf they contrary\ndid to this hys wy&llbar;, he shuld punyssh them so cruelly\nthat al other shuld take ensample therby.  And thene\nhe, his lady, & his folke retourned to Famagoce / and\nthe quene was grete with child / And now resteth\nthystorye of them, and speketh of Guyon and of the\nmaister of Rodes, that rowed on the see by the Costes\nof Surye, of Damask, of Baruth, of Tupple, & of\nDanette, for to knowe yf paynemes were on the see\nor not. Now saith thistorye, that so long sailled & rowed\nthe Crystens on the see, that they sawe aprouc&hbar;\nas of a leghe nygh to them a certayn quantite of shippes,\nbut by liklyhode they might not be grete nombre.\nThenne they sent a Galleye toward our folke that al\nredy were in ordynaunce to wete what they were / but\nthe galey came so nygh that the cristens, our folke, toke it / and by them knew and vnderstode almaner of\ntydynges.  Oure folke thanne halid vp saylles hastly,\nand saylled anone toward theire enmys.  And whan the\npaynemes perceyued them they were moc&hbar; abasshed,\nand gretly aferd, and wend wel to haue withdraw them\nself in to the hauen of Baruth / but our galeyes\naduaunced them, and ran vpon them by al sydes.  There\nwas grete occysion / and shortly to say the paynemes\nwere dyscomfyted, and their nauye take / and a&llbar; were\ncast ouerbor&dtail; or slayne.  And the nauye was fu&llbar; of\ngrete goodes.  And after our barons putte them self in\nthe see ayen for to haue retourned in to Cypre.  but\nby fortune & strengthe of wyndes they were cast to\nCruly in Armanye.  And whan the king of Armanye,\nthat was brother vnto kinge of Cipre, knewe theire\ncommyng, he sent anone for to wete what folke they\nwere / And the master of Rodes said to them that\ncame to wete what they wer: 'Telle the kyng that it\nis the brother of Vryan of Lusynen, kyng of Cypre,\nthat hath trauersed the see for to wete & knowe yf\npaynemes were on it in armes, for to haue come vpon\nthe Cypryens for cause of the saudan that hath be\ndycomfyted & slayn, and al his folke at the grete batay&llbar;\nof Famagoce.'  'How,' said they Armanye, 'is there\nony other kyng in Cypre our kingis brother?'  'By\nmy feyth,' said the maister of Rodes, 'ye / For the\nking was wounded with a dart enuenymed by the\nsawdans hand in so mortal a wyse that he is deed\ntherof, and he beying yet alyue, he gaf his doughtir in\nmaryage to Vrian of Lusynen, that slew the saudan\n& dyscomfyted a&llbar; his folk.'  Whan they thanne\nvnderstode hym, they yede & denounced it to theire kyng,\nwhic&hbar; was sorowfu&llbar; of the deth of his brother.  but\nnot withstandyng, he came toward the see syde with\na grete company, and entred in to the vesse&llbar; where Guyon and the maister of Rodes were in.  And whan\nguyon wyst of his commyng he went ayenst hym, and\neche to o\u00feer made grete reuerence.  Thenne said the\nking to the grete Pryour of Rodes, 'Maister, sethen\nthis yong damoyseau is brother vnto my nyghtis lord,\nI were vncurteys whan he is arryued in my land, yf I\nreceyued hym not honourably as to hym\napparteyneth.  And of this I pray you, that ye vouchesaf to pray hym\non my behalf, that it playse hym to come in to our\npaleys, and we shal doo to hym the best chere that we\ncan.'  'By my feyth,' said the grete Pryour / 'that\nshal I doo gladly.'  Thanne he spak therof to guyon,\nwhiche ansuerd to hym right gladly, 'I wold doo a\ngreter thinge yf it lay in my power for the kyngis\nsake.  For good feyth & rayson requyreth it.'  And thenne\nthey went togider / and guyon lede with hym a fayre\ncompanye of knightes / but alwayes they had theire\ncotes of stele on \u00feem, and were in right good aray, as\nfolke vsed to the faytte of armes.  And here speke I\nno more of \u00feem, And shal speke of Florye the\ndoughter of the kynge of Armanye. / Thistorye sayth that the kynge of Armanye had a\ndoughter, and none other children / but\nhere. And the quene, his wyf, was deed / and wete it \u00feat\nthis kyng and the kyng of Cypre had to theire spouses\nthe two susters that were doughters to the kyng of\nMalegres / and eche of them gate a doughtir on their\nwyues / of the whiche Ermyne that Vryan spoused\nwas one / and that other was the pucelle florye of\nwhome I haue bygonne to traytte.  She was that tyme\nat Cruly ryght glad & joyous of the commyng of\nthe straungers.  She appareylled and arayed her self\nmoche richely, and so dide a&llbar; her damoyselles.  Soone\nafter came the kynge her fader / guyon / the maister\nof Rodes, & theire felawship, and entred in to the\ntoune, and came to the palleys in to the grete halle. And thenne Florye, that moc&hbar; desyred theire\ncommyng, came there, and humbled herself moche ayenst\nher fader / and the kyng said to her, 'Cherysshe and\ndoth feste to this noble men, & receyue them\nhonourably / and in especiall the brother of my nyghtis lord &\nhusband.'  And whan the mayde vnderstode that, she\nwas fu&llbar; glad & joyous.  She thenne came to guyon /\ntoke hym by the hand swetly, & sayd: 'Sire\ndamoyseau, ye be right welcome in to my faders\nroyalme.'  'Damoyselle,' sayd Guyon, 'gramercy to you.'  There /\nbygan thenne the feest right grete & fayre / and wel\nthey were festyed, & seruyd with dyuerse meetes &\nwynes / and betwix guyon & Florye were many honeste\n& gracyous talkyng. and wete it for certayn yf guyon\nhad had leyser, he had dyscouered his thoughte to\nher. but while they were in that grete solace & joye, a\ngaleye arryued to the port that came fro Rodes / and\nthey that were within were receyued honourably of\nthem of the toune / and joyful & right glad they were\nwhan they knew that theire maister was\nthere.  Wherfore one of them said to the peuple there, 'Sires,\nvouchesauf to lede one of vs there the lordes befor,\nto aduertyse them of paynemes that ben vpon the see\nin grete nombre.'  Thanne was a knight brought there\nthe maister of Rodes was / and said to hym, that\npaynemes with grete nauye were passed byfore the yle\nof Rodes / and had taken the wind & waye toward\nCypre / and how men said that the Calyphe of Bandas\nwith a&llbar; hys puyssaunce & power was there.  Whan\nthe maister of Rodes vnderstode these tydynges, he\nwent & told Guyon of it.  Wherfore, guyon seeyng\nhym self as constrayned, humbly said to the pucelle,\n'Damoyselle, right hertily I beseche you that ye\nvouchesaf, sethen I moste departe your presens, to ca&llbar;\nme ofte in your remembraunce / For as to my part,\nyour vassa&llbar; & seruaunt shal I euer be vnder the standart of your gouernance.'  Florye thanne knowyng\nfor certayn his soudayn departyng, her herte was fylled\nwith dueyl & sorowe / how wel she kept contenaunce\nin the best manere that she coude / and louyngly\nbeheld guyon, whiche toke his leue of her fader, that\nconueyed hym to the see side, and grete peple with\nhym.  There thenne entred guyon in to his ship, and\ncommanded the sailles shuld be had vp to the wynde,\nthat was good & propyce to them.  And wete that\nFlorye was mounted vp vnto the vppermost wyndowe\nof an hye tour, and neuer departed thens tyl she lost\nthe sight of guyons vessel, prayeng god to preserue\nhym from al daunger. / Thystorye recounteth & saith here that the Caliphe\nof Bandas, and the kinge of Brandymount in\ntharse, that was uncle to the saudan of Damaske, herde\ntydynges how the sawdan was slayn, and al his folke\nputte to grete dyscomfyture in the yle of\nCypre.  Wherfore they beyng fu&llbar; sory therof assembled anone theire\npower / and purposyng to auenge his deth entred theire\nshippes, and toke theire way toward Cypre / and they\nsupposyng the Cypryens had be without king, hyed\nthem fast thitherward in suche manere that they shuld\nnot be perceyued where as they shuld arryue.  but \u00feey\nof Rodes perceyued them, and made knowleche \u00feerof\nvnto kyng Vryan, that alredy had assembled his peple,\nand putte them in aray for to receyue the batay&llbar;. and\nmorouer had made good ordonnaunce and gardes for the\nportes, that assoone as they shuld perceyue them\ncommyng to the hauen, that they shuld make a token of\nfyre, wherby the Countrey might perceyue the commyng\nof theire enmyes, and euery man to be redy in armes\nthitherward / and so was the kingis proclamacion\nvpon deth.  And wete it that the king kept the feldes\nin the myddes of the portes of his royalme for to\nbe the sooner at the porte where the sarrasyns shuld arryue to take theire landing / And the king made so\ngrete moustre & semblaunt that he gaf his peple so\ngrete courage, that with hym & his enterpryse they\ndurst wel fight with the Caliphe, and with his\npuyssaunce.  It happned so, by the grace of god, that the\nsee was enragid thrugh the stormes and horryble\ntempeste, that the sarrasyns were al dysmayed &\nabasshed / and the tempeste casted them in suche wyse\nhere & there, that within short tyme they ne wyst\nwhere eyghte of theire galeyes were become.  And on\nthe morowe about the hooure of pryme, thayer was al\nclere, and the wynd cessed, and the sonne shone fayre\n& clere / thenne the grete shippes of the paynemes\nheld them togidre, & toke theire way vnto the port\nof Lymasson.  And of them I leue to speke / and shal\nshew you of the viii vessels that were sparpylled by\nthe tempeste, and what way they held / and in thoo\nvessels was a&llbar; thartyllery of the paynemes, as gonnes,\nbowes, arowes / ladders / paueys, & such habylements\nof werre as they had / and so it fortuned that guyon\nand the maister of Rodes with theire puyssaunce\nrecountred them, and perceyued eche other.  but whan\noure peple knewe that they were sarasyns / and the\nsarasyns knew that they were crysten peuple / they\nbygane eche of them to lye and bor&dtail; other with\nshotte of gonnes & crosbowes / and whan they were\nchayned togidre they threw darts as thikk as hayle\nstones / and the batay&llbar; was so grete, hard, & stronge /\nbut guyon, the maister of Rodes, & theire puyssaunce\nassaylled so manfully the paynemes that they knew\nnot to what part they shuld tourne them to defende,\nFor our peuple that were in the galeyes faught so\nmightly that the paynemes were as dycomfyted.  There\nmight men here them crye on theire goddes / nat that\nwithstanding they were dyscomfyte & slayne.  And\nthanne whan theire admyra&llbar;, that was maister of the artylery, sawe the dycomfiture tourned vpon them /.\nhe made to be haused a lytel galyote out of the grete\ngaleye with viii hores / and so entred he and eyghte\npersonnes with hym of the secretest / and toke\nthauenture of the wynd / & rowed so mightly that our peuple\nmeruaylled \u00feerof / but they made neuer semblaunce to\npursiew them / but entred into the paynemes vessels,\n& bygan to cast alle ouerbord.  but they toke to the\nnombre of ij C sarasyns prysonners / wherof guyon gaf\noo hondred to the maister of Rodes to make them\ncristen, and also two galeyes / and guyon toke the\nother hondred sarasyns and two of the moost richest\nvessels that they had wonne, and toke it to a knyght\nof Rodes / and thus said to hym, 'Conduyte me this\ntwo galeys, and \u00feis houndred sarrasyns to Cruly, and\nrecommand me to the kinge & his doughtir / and on\nmy byhalue presente to the pucelle Florye this two\nvessels as they are garnysshed / and to the kyng the\nhoundred sarasyns.'  Wherof the knyght toke the\ncharge & departed, & hasted hym tyl he came to the\nCite of Cruly / and dide his message as he was youen\nin commandement / and recounted to them the grete\ndyscomfyture and the valyaunt conduyte of\nguyon.  'By my feyth,' said the kynge, 'ye be welcome, and\nthankin&gtee; be to that noble damoyseau' / And the pucelle\nwas so joyous of these nouuelles that she had neuer in\nher naturel lyf so grete joye.  For knowe ye wel she\nloued so entierly guyon \u00feat a&llbar; her joye was of\nhym.  The king thanne & his doughter yaf to the knight a\nriche jewel, wherof he thanked \u00feem, and toke leue of\nthem, & retourned hastly to Rodes.  And anone, after\nhys departyng, the kyng of Armenye questyoned with\nthe paynemes where the armee of the Calyphe was /\nand they said in Cipre to reuenge the deth of the\nsawdan of Damaske that the Cipryens had slayn in\nbatay&llbar;.  'Par ma foy,' sayd the kyng, 'as for you, ye haue faylled of your enterpryse' / And thenne he\ncommanded that they shuld be feteryd with yrons, and to\nbe putte in to parfounde pryson / and the two vessels\nto be descharged, and a&llbar; the goodes that were in to be\nborne into the Castel.  It is now tyme that I speke\nof guyon and of the maister of Rodes, that had\nquestyoned the sarasyns wher the Calyphe purposed to\nland / and they said in Cypre.  Guyon thenne by\nthauys and Counsey&llbar; of his barons for cause they had\nmany vessels & lytel nombre of peuple / commanded\nthat al thartylery that they had wonne shuld be putte\ninto theire shippes / and also al other thinges that were\nof nede to them / and the remanaunt & the vessels also / he gaf to the maister of Rodes that sent them to\nRodes.  And whan this was don they saylled, & hasted \u00feem\ntoward Cypre.  And here leueth thystory to spek of\nthem / and retourneth to speke of the galyote where\nthadmyra&llbar; was in, where it became or toke porte. /. Thystory sayth that the kyng brandymount & the\nCalyphe of Bandas were sorowfu&llbar; for \u00feeir losse\n& grete dommage / and so longe rowed thadmyral on\nthe see that he perceyued the port of Lymasson, &\nsawe grete nauye byfore the toune.  And whan he came\nsomewhat nyg&hbar; he herd shotte of gonnes & sowne of\ntrompettes, and soone after he knew that it was \u00fee\nCalyphe of Bandas and his armee, & the puyssaunce of\nkyng brandymount of tharse, that assaylled them of\nthe toune for to take it.  But there was the Captayne\nof the place & his peple wel paueysed, that valyauntly\ndeffended the porte in so moche that the sarasyns\ngat there nought / but lost many of their men, and\nwysshed ofte aftir theire galeyes with theire gonnes &\nartyllery that were sprad on the see by the tempeste /\nthey wyst not where.  Thenne came to them thadmyral\nthat thus said on hye: 'By my feyth, Calyphe, woo may be to you, For your nauye that I conduyted is lost\n& take, For the Cristen recountred vs vpon the see, and\nhaue dyscomfyted vs / and none is scaped but only we\nthat are here / and at oo wor&dtail; al is lost / for to hold\nyou long compte therof that shuld preuayll you nought.'\nThenne whan the Calyphe vnderstode hym he was\nsorowfu&llbar; & dolaunt. 'By my feyth,' said he / 'lordis, here\nben heuy tydinges.  For wel I see that Fortune slepeth\nas to our help / and so hath he doo long / but\nfauourable & moche propice it is as now to crysten peple, For\nwel it appereth presently by vs / and so dide but of late by our Cousyn the saudan, the which & al hys\npeuple also haue be slayn or dyscomfyte in the same\nyle of Cypre.'  Thenne said the admyral to hym: 'Sire,\nyf ye anounce or shew semblaunce of abasshement\nbyfore your folke that shal cause them to be half\ndyscomfyte / and ouermore knowe ye to this that I perceyue\nof them of this porte & toune, that they be not shappen\nto lete you arryue & entre theire land without sore\nfyghting and grete sawtes gyuyng.  For they shew not\nto be aferd of your puyssaunce.  therefore I wold aduyse\n& counsey&llbar; you, that we sha&llbar; withdraw vs into the\nhye see, & lete coule them self / and about the spryng\nof the day we shalbe at a lytel porte that not ferre is\nhens called the port of saynt Andrew / and there\nwithout ony deffense or gaynsayeng we may take lan&dtail;.'\nAnd this they dide.  And whan the Captayn of\nLymasson sawe hys enmyes departe, he made a rampyn or\nsmal galeye to folow them of ferre, \u00feat it coude not be\nperceyued of them / and aspyed how at euen they\nancred aboute a myle nygh to saynt Andrews\nporte.  Thanne retourned the rampyn hastly toward\nLymasson / and to the captayne recounted al that he had\nseen / Thenne made the captayn fyre to be putte high\nvpon the garde for manere of token / and whan they\nof the nerest garde or watching place sawe the token of fyre / soone after fyre was made fro garde to garde,\nthat knowleche was therof thrugh a&llbar; the\nroyalme.  Thenne euery man, what on foot & on horsbake, drew\nthem self to the place where kyng Vryan was, that al\nredy had sent hys espyes to knowe wher the paynemes\nshuld land, and manded to euery captayne they shuld\nkepe & defend wel theire fortresses / 'For,' said he,\n'yf it playse god none of them shal not repasse the\nsee.  And here resteth the hystorye to speke of kynge\nVryan / and bygynneth to speke of the Caliphe. / In this partye sheweth thistorye / that the sarasyns\nthat were entred in to the see / as soone as \u00feey\napperceyued the day spryng, they deceueryd, & toke\nvp theire ancres, and came al in oo flotte to the porte,\n& there landed.  And wete it wel, that they of thabbey\nof saynt andrew perceyued them wel, the whiche\nimmediatly made knowleche to Lymasson / and the\nCaptayne of \u00fee place gaf vnto the kyn&gtee; knowlec&hbar;\ntherof / the whic&hbar; had grete joye therof / and fourthwith\nbygan to apparay&llbar; hym to go to batay&llbar;.  And the\nCalyphe, hys enemy, made to be putte a land his\nartylery out of the shippes / and dide make hys lodgis\ntherby, as it were half a leghe fro the port, vpon a\ngrete ryuere at a cornere of a lytel wode, to refresshe\nhym & his peple also; and lefte foure thousand men\nwithin the shippes, for theire sauegarde / and in the\nmeane saison guyon / the maister of Rodes, & theire\npeuple arryued to Lymasson / where men said to them\nhow the sarasyns had landed / and how theire nauye\nwas a leghe fro saynt Andrewes porte. 'By my feyth,'\nsayd Guyon, 'we shal thanne goo & vysyte them / For\nwho that might take them fro the sarasyns, none of\nthem shuld neuer retourne foot, in sury nor in tharsy' /\nand in these wordes sayeng, they putte them in to the\nsee, & went lightly sayllyn&gtee;, that they came so nygh\nthe panemes that they sawe the porte of saynt Andrew, and the grete nombre of shippes that were\nthere.  Thenne they putte themself in aray and in good\nordynaunce / and this done, they rane vpon theire enemys\nas thondre & tempeste, smyttyn&gtee; vpon the shippes of\nthe sarasyns byforce of shotte so horrybly, that yl\nbestade were the sarasyns, that wel happy was he that\nmyght recouere the lan&dtail;.  And by that meane were\nthe shippes take / and al the sarasyns that were take\nwere putte to deth.  Thanne guyon sent to the abbey\nfoyson of them that he had wonne of the sarasyns /\nand brought to Lymasson with them as many galeyes\n& shippes as there were laden with the goodes of the\nsarasyns, except suche as they brent.  And \u00fee other\nthat escaped, came to thoost of theire lord, cryeng with\na hye voys alarme / and recounted & said how the\nCristen had by force & strengthe discomfited\nthem.  Thenne was the oost gretly mevyd, & came to the\nport who best coude, and fonde many of theire peuple\nded, and som were hyd in the busshes.  And whan the\nCalyphe perceyued & sawe this grete dommage, he was\nmoche dolaunt.  'By machomete,' said he to kyng\nBrandymount, 'these Cristen that are come hither fro\nFraunce, ben ouermoche hardy & appert men in armes,\nand yf they soiourne lon&gtee; here it shal be to our grete\ndommage' / 'By machomet,' said the kyng\nBrandymount,' I shal neuer departe fro this lan&dtail; vnto tyme I\nbe al dyscomfyted, or \u00feat I haue put them to flyght, &\nbrought to an euyl en&dtail;.'  'No more shal I doo,' ansuer&dtail;\nCaliphe.  Thenne \u00feey recouered there six of theire\ngaleyes, & eschiewed \u00feem fro the fyre, and lefte in it\ngood wardes for to kepe them; and after they retourned\nto theire peple.  And here cesseth thystorye of them /\nand retournet&hbar; to speke of Vryan / Now sheweth thistorye how the kyng Vryan was\nlodged in a fayre medow vpon a ryuere, in that\nself place where the fourragers of the sawdan were dyscomfyted at the brydge, as before is sai&dtail;.  And had\nsent his espyes to haue knowlege where his enemyes\nhad take theyre lodgys / And thenne came the\nmaister of Rodes, whiche alighted byfore the kinges\npauyllon, whom he made reuerence moche\nhonourably.  And the king, that was moche joyous of his commyng,\nreceyued hym benyngly, and demanded of hym how\nguyon his brother dyde.  'By my feyth, sire,' said the\nmaister of Rodes, 'wel / as the moost assurest man that\neuer I knew.  Sire, he recommandeth hym to you as\naffectually as he may.'  'Nowe telle me,' said the king,\n'how ye haue doo syn that ye departed from vs?'  And\nthe maister recounted hym fro braunche to braunche\na&llbar; thauentures that had happed to them.  'By my\nfeyth,' said the kyng, 'ye haue worthyly vyaged; I\nthanke & lawde my Creatour therof / and as for myn\nvncle, \u00fee kynge of Armanye, I am moche glad that ye\nlefte hym in good prosperyte.  but we most haue\naduys of our Counsey&llbar;, to see how we may dystroye\nthe Sarasyns / and as touching me & my peple, I am\nredy to departe for to approuche to them, For to long\nthey haue soiourned in our land without to haue assayed\nvs. goo thanne toward my brother, and telle hym that\nI departe for to goo ayenst the paynemes.'  The maister\nthanne toke leue of king Vryan, and hastly retourned\nto Lymasson / and immedyatly the king & his peuple\nmarched fourth, tyl they came & lodged them a leghe\nnygh to the Calyphes oost, vnknowyng the paynemes\nof it.  And the maister of Rodes came to guyon, and\ntold hym how the kyng was departed for to recountre\n& fyght with the sarasyns; wherfore guyon commanded\nhis trompettes to blow, and departed fro Lymasson in\nfayre aray; & came vnto a ryuere, and lodged hym\ntherby, vpon the whic&hbar; ryuere were the paynemes\nlodged, & no distaunce of space was betwene them\n& their enemyes, but a high mountayne.  And now resteth thistorye of hym, and retourneth to speke of\nVryan his brother. Thystorye sayth that kyng Vryan desired moc&hbar; to\nknowe where the sarasyns were lodged / also to\nhaue true knowlege of theire conuyne; wherfore he\ncalled to hym a knyght, that knew wel al the Countrey,\nand said to hym : 'putte on your harneys, and take the\nsurest hors that ye haue, and come alone here byfore\nmy pauyllon : and telle nobody of it / & ye shal come\nwith me there as I shal lede you' / and anone the\nknight dide his commandement / and wel horsed &\narmed retourned to hym byfore hys tente, wher he\nfonde king vryan redy on horsbak, the whic&hbar; said to\nsome of his barons, 'Sires, meue not your self fro this\nplace tyl ye haue tydinges of me / but yf I cam not\nhither ayen / loke ye doo that I shal lete you wete by\nthis knyght.'  And they ansuer&dtail; that so shuld they\ndoo / 'but take good hede,' sayd they agayn, 'where\nye goo' / 'be not in doubte therfore,' said vryan to\nthem / And thenne they departed; and Vryan said to\nthe knight, 'conduyte me now the surest waye that ye\ncan, tyl that I may see the porte where the sarasyns\nlanded.'  And the knyght lede hym vnto the hylle\nryght high, & said:  'Sire, yonder is the porte that ye\ndesire to see.'  'And how,' said the kyn&gtee;, 'it hath\nbe said to me that theire nauye was al brent, and yet I\nsee yonder some grete vessels?  Fro whens myght they\nbe come now?' / and thenne behild the kin&gtee; / at the\nsynester syde in to the founs of the valey, and sawe\nhis brothers oost, that was lodged vpon the ryuere /\nand at the ryght syde of the hille he sawe \u00fee Caliphes\noost, that were in grete nombre.  'By my feyth,' said\nthe kyng, 'yonder is grete multitude of peple\npayneme / them I knowe wel ynoug&hbar; but \u00feey of this\nother syde I knowe not what they be.  abyde me here, and I sha&llbar; goo wete what folke they be, yf I\nmay.'  The kyng thanne rode tyl he came nygh his\nbro\u00feers oost, and founde a knight on his way, whic&hbar; he\nknew wel; and anoon called hym by hys name, and\ndemaunded of hym yf his brother guyon was there /.\nWhan the knight vnderstode hys wordes, he beheld\n& knew hym, and soone kneeled byfore hym,\nsayeng in this manere: 'My liege & souerayn lord, your\nbrother guyon is yonder with al hys peuple, and the\nmaister of Rodes also.'  Thenne commanded hym the\nkyng that he shuld goo to Guyon hys brother, and\ntelle hym that he shuld come & speke with hym\nvpon the said mountayne.  And the knight went &\ntolde these tydinges to guyon; wherfor he, and the\nmaister of Rodes with hym, mounted on horsbak / toke\nthe way to the mountaynewar&dtail;, wher as Vryan retourned\nto his knyght, whome he said:  'Frend, wel it is with\nvs, For that is my brother guyon whic&hbar; is lodged\nyonder.'  Thenne came \u00feer guyon & the maister of\nRodes where the two bretheren made moche, eche of\no\u00feer.  The kinge after shewed to them thoost of theire\nenemyes / and whan they sawe it / they said / 'we\nwyst not them so nygh to vs.' 'Now,' said vryan,\n'they may not escape vs, yf it be not by the meanes of\nyonder galeyes,' wherof guyon was abasshed / 'For,'\nsaid he / 'these deuels haue brought moo vessels, For\nwithin these foure dayes last passed we toke & brent\nal theyre nauye.'  'Thenne,' said the maister of Rodes,\n'I suppose wel what that is / happely some of them\nwere not fonde, whic&hbar; haue eschewed that few shippes\nfro the fyre.'  'By my feyth,' sai&dtail; the kyng, 'thus it\nmay wel be / but \u00feerto We most puruey of gardes,\nFor therby shuld mowe escape the chief lordes of\ntheire oost, that happly might adommage vs in time\nto come.'  'How, sire,' said the maister of Rodes, 'it\nsemeth that ye haue dycomfyted them al redy, and that it ne resteth more but to kepe the Calyphe and\nbrandymount, that they scape not at \u00feat porte.'\n'Certaynly,' ansuer&dtail; the kynge, 'yf they be nomore than I\nsee, we nede not so grete peple as god ha\u00fe leued vs.'\nThe kinge thenne commanded his knight, \u00feat he shuld\ngoo to hys oost and make them to be putte in aray,\nand that he shuld conduyte them vnto \u00fee foot of the\nsai&dtail; mountayne.  The knight departed, & dide as it\nwas youen to hym in commandement / and al thoost\nobeyed hym, and came in fayre aray & good\nordynaunce vnto the hille.  Also guyon went and made\nhys peple to be armed, and brought \u00feem at the other\nsyde of the ryuere, so nygh the paynemes oost that he\nmight wel perceyue theire manyere &\ncontenaunce.  And the kyng commanded the maister of Rodes, that\nhe with a&llbar; hys peuple shuld entre in to \u00fee see / and\nthat they shuld trauerse, rowyng nygh the porte, to\nthende yf the sarasyns shuld putte & withdraw them\nself into theire shippes, that they might not escape /\n'And I goo,' sayd vryan, 'putte my peple in aray, forto\ngyue batay&llbar; to these paynemes.' The kynge thenne came to his oost, and made his\narchers & crosbowe men to marche & goo fourth;\nand after folowed the wynges.  & the arryergarde came\nafter in fayre ordonnaunce / and assoone as \u00fee sarasyns\nperceyued them, they bygan alarme, and euery payneme\narmed hym self / but or they were a&llbar; armed, Vryan\nsent vpon them a thousan&dtail; good men of armes wel\nhorsed, that moche adommaged them, for they fonde\nthem vnpurueyed & out of aray.  But notwithstanding,\nthey assembled them in batay&llbar; & aray.  Thanne bygan\nthe stoure fyers & cruel.  For there had ye seen arowes\nflee as thykk as motes in the sonne / and after Vryan\nand his auantgarde assembled to his enemys; and so\nmanfully they faught, that they made the sarasyns to\nwithdraw bakward.  For vryan made there so grete fayttes of armes, and gaf so pesaunt & horryble strokes\nboth to the lyft & right syde, that al them that he\nrecountred he smote & threw doun fro theire horses to\nthe erthe, in so moc&hbar; that his enemyes fled byfore hym\nas the partrych doth byfore the sperehauke.  And\nwhanne the Calyphe of Bandas perceyued hym, he\nshewed hym to kyng Brandymount, sayeng, 'yf we be\nabasshed and yl besta&dtail; of this man only, al the other\nshal preyse & doubte vs nought' / and sayeng these\nwordes, he broched his hors with hys sporys that blood\nrane out of bothe sydes / And know it wel, that this\nCaliphe was one of the moost fyers & strengest man\nthat was that tyme alyue / he casted hys targe behynd\nhis bakk / toke hys swerd, & rane vpon vryan, the\nwhiche he recountred / and by grete yre gaf hym so\nmeruayllable a stroke vpon that one syde of hys\nhelmet, that hys swer&dtail; redounded vpon hys hors nek\nby suche myght that nyg&hbar; he cutte his throtte\nof.  Thanne came kynge Brandymount vpon vryan, the\nwhic&hbar;, seeynge his hors almost deed, stoo&dtail; vpon hys\nfeet, & lete goo hys swer&dtail; fro his hand, and embrased\nhis enemy; and by the strengthe of his two armes,\npulled hym from his hors doun to therthe.  There was the prees grete, both of Sarasyns that wold rescue\ntheyre lord / and of cypryens also, that wold haue\nholpen vryan theire kynge, to bryn&gtee; hys enterpryse at\naffect.  The batay&llbar; was there morta&llbar; fyers & doubtous\nfor bothe partyes.  but vryan drew a short knyff out of\nthe shethe that hanged at his lyft syde, and threstid it\nvnder the gorgeret thrugh brandymontis nek, and thus\nhe slewgh hym.  Thanne sto&dtail; vryan vpon his feet\nayen, and cryed with a high voys 'Lusynen, Lusynen' /\nand the Poyteuyns that her&dtail; that, putte them self in\nprees by suche vertu, gyuyng so grete strokes that the\nsarrasyns that were about vryan lost & voyded the\nplace.  Thenne was kyng vryan remounted vpon kyng brandymontis hors, and pursiewed the Caliphe of\nBandas / and thus bygan ayen the batay&llbar; to be\nreforced, in so moche that grete occysyon was don on\neyther partye.  And in that meane season came guyon\nwith his peuple, and courageously rane vpon \u00feeire\nenemyes.  And whan the Caliphe saw hym be\nsurprysed on eche syde by his mortal enemyes / he with\nxi departed in the secretest manere that he coude out\nof the batay&llbar;, and fled toward the see / where the\nadmyra&llbar; of Damask was, whiche made them to entre\ninto a lytel galyote, in whiche he escaped, as byfore is\nsaid / and soone aftir he made the nauye, that he saued\nfro brennyng, to take vp theire ancres, & entred in\nthe see.  And here seaceth thystorye of hym, and\nretournet&hbar; to speke of the batay&llbar;. / In this partye sheweth thystorye, & sayth \u00feat whan\nthe sarasyns knew the deth of theyre kynge\nbrandymount / and how the Caliphe on whos prowes &\nstrengthe was al theire hope & comfort was thus\ndeparted and fled, they were a&llbar; abasshed, and bygan\nstrongly to breke their aray and to voyde the place,\nputtyng themself to flight. xviis. viiid. is noted in margin of MS. If it is price of copying up to this point, it would be about the rate if 1d. a page. What shuld I make you\nlong compte / the paynemes were putt a&llbar; to deth,\nwhat in batay&llbar;, what fleyng as drowned in the\nsee.  And after the chaas, retourned kyng vryan and hys\nbarons to the paynemys lodgis, where they found in\ntheir tentes & pauyllons grete riches.  And here\nthistorye cesseth of kyng vryan / and I shal shew vnto you\nhow the caliphe of Bandas dyde, the whic&hbar; swore by\nhis machomet & his goddes, that yf he myght euer come\nto sauete in damask ayen, yet shuld he doo grete\nhynderaunce & enuye to the Cypryens.  But as he was\nrowyng in the see / and supposed to haue escaped al parels / the maister of Rodes that kept the see and\nwayted after hym, as aboue is sayd, perceyued the\nsarasyns flote \u00feat wold haue retourned to Damask /\nbygan to lye by them and sayd to his peuple in this\nmanere: 'Fayre lordes and knightes of Ieshu Criste, our\ndesyre and wysshyng is brought to effect, for\nknowlege we haue ynough that the valyaunt & redoubted\nkyng vryan hath obtayned the vyctory vpon his\nenemyes & oures / yf we be now men of faytte & valyaunt,\nnone of them shal neuer see Damaske.'  Who thanne\nhad seen the Cristen putte them self in aray, and theire\nmeruayllable shottyng with gonnes & arowes vpon the\nsarasyns, he shuld haue be meruaylled / and syn oure\nfolke cheyned with them & casted darts & stones with\nsuche strengthe & might, that wonder it was to\nsee.  The sarasyns defendid hem self manfully / but at last\nthey were dyscomfyte.  And the admyra&llbar; that sawe\nthe grete myschief \u00feat fe&llbar; on them hallid vp saylles /\nrowed in hys galyote with eyght hores and so he\nescaped.  And the maister of Rodes and hys peple\ntoke the galeyes of theire enemyes and a&llbar; slew or\ncasted ouer bord / and brought them ayen to saynt\nandrews porte.  Thanne the maister of Rodes\nacompanyed with C knightes, bretheren of his religyon, went\ntoward king vryan & guyon his brother, and recounted\nto them a&llbar; theire good fortune.  but sory was the king\nthat the Caliphe and the admyral were so\nescaped.  kyn&gtee; Vryan thenne departed & dalt emon&gtee; his peuple\nal the proye of his enemyes that he had wonne / sauf\nhe reteyned for hym the artylery & some pauyllons &\ntentes, and gaf them leue to retourne in to theire\nCountrees.  These thinges thus don, kyng vryan in\ngrete tryumphe & honour as vyctorious prynce,\nretourned to his cyte of Famagoce, acompayned of Guyon\nhis brother, of the maister of Rodes, and of al the\nbarons, wher the quene Ermyne receyued them right honourably, thankyng god of the noble vyctorye that\nthey obteyned vpon his enemyes./ Now sayth thistorye, that Ermyne was grete with\nchild & nygh her terme / and that vryan made\na feest to be cryed & proclaimed; For he wold in tyme\nof peas & rest haue festyed his barons of poytou and\nal other prynces estraungers & other his\nsubgects.  Eyght dayes toforne the feste, begane grete multitude\nof peuple to come to the Cite, wherof the kyng was\njoyful, and made cryees vpon peyne of deth that none\nshuld make derrer the vytaylles.  And trouth it was\nthat thre dayes tofore the feste the quene Ermyne\nwas delyuered of a fayre sone.  Thenne bygan the\nfeste to wex grete / and the child baptised and named\nHenry, bycause of hys auncestre hight Henry.  And\nso encreased the feest in ryches & in yeftes.  And\nthere were some of the barons of poytou that toke\ntheire leue of the kin&gtee; & of his brother, and of the\nquene, for to departe, whom the kynge yaf grete yeftes\nof riches.  And they were in nombre six knightes and\n\u00feeire companye, whic&hbar; putte them in to the see.  Now\nwyl I cesse of them that are departed to the see / &\nshal shewe of the feste that was ryght noble and\nsumptuous, but soone it was turned to sorowe, bycause of\nthe tydinges of the kingis deth of Armenye that came\nto the Court./ Thystorye sheweth a&llbar; thus, whan the feest was at\nbest, there came xxi ti knightes of the moost\nnoblest barons of the royalme of armanye, al clothed in\nblack / and it shewed wel by theire contenaunce that\nthey were sorowful in herte.  And whan they cam tofore\nthe kyn&gtee; they dide theire obeyssaunce ryght nobly /\nand the kynge receyued them with grete honour / and\nthey said to him: 'Sire, the kynge of armenye, your\nvncle, is passed out of this world, on whos sowle god haue mercy / and hath lefte to vs a ryght fayre pucelle\nbegoten of his body by lawfu&llbar; maryage / and she is\nalone hys heyre.  Now knowe ye thenne, noble kynge,\nthat in hys playn lyf he dide doo make this lettre, and\ncommanded vs to directe it to your noble grace /\nprayeng the same that the tenour of \u00fee lettre ye vouchesaf\ntacomplysshe.'  'By my feith, fayre lordes,' said Vryan /\n'yf it be of the thing that I may goodly doo, I shal\nfulfy&llbar; his wy&llbar; right gladly.'  Thenne toke Vryan\nthe lettre & redd it, of the whiche the tenour was this:\n'Ryght dere lord and right wel beloued nevew, I\nrecommande me to you as ferfourth as I may / prayen&gtee;\nyou right hertyly to haue me to my ryght dere &\nbeloue&dtail; nyghte your wyf to be recommande&dtail;.  And\nwhere by these my lettres I make to you the first\nrequeste that euer I demanded of you / also consideryn&gtee;\nthat it shal be the last / For certaynly at the makyng\nof thees my present lettres, I felt myself in such poynt\nthat in me was none hope of conualescence nor of\nlyf.  I hertyly beseche you that ye haue it not in reffus nor\nin dysdayne.  It is so thanne that none heyre I ne\nhaue of my body, sauf only a doughter, the whic&hbar;\nyour brother guyon sawe but of late / whan he was\nwith me.  Wherfore I pray you that ye vouchsauf to\nentrette your said bro\u00feer in manere that it playse hym,\nto take the cepter of my dignite rya&llbar; and my doughter\nto hys lady, and thus to crowne hym self king of\narmanye.  And though she be not worthy to haue\nhym to her lord, yet is she come of royal\nbloo&dtail;.  consideryng thanne her consanguinite haue pite on her /\nand  yf that mouyth not you to compassyon / yet\nremembre that ye be champyon of Crist, exalting his\nfeyth.  My royalme is now cristen, and hath be long\nsoo / Woo were to me / yf for wantyng of a preu &\nvalyaunt man it shuld retourne in to the paynemes\nhandes.  Wherfore, noble kyn&gtee;, haue regarde to this that forsaid is,' &c.  Whan vryan vnderstode the tenour\nof \u00fee lettre he was moche dolaunt of the kingis deth /\n& mouyd by compassion & pyte, ansuer&dtail; to the Armanyens, sayeng in this manere: 'Lordes & barons, I shall\nnot fay&llbar; you at your nede, For yf my brother wyl not\naccorde therto, yet sha&llbar; I endeuoyre my self to gyue\nyou helpe, ayde, comfort, & counseyl, as ferre as my\npower shal reche.'  Thanne called he to hym guyon,\nhys bro\u00feer, that thanne knew the kingis deth, wherof\nhe was sorrowfu&llbar; / and vryan to hym sayd the wordes\nthat here folowen: 'Guyon, receyue this yefte, For I\nmake you heyre of armenye and possessour of the moost\nfayrest pucelle that is in a&llbar; the lan&dtail; / that is my\nCousyn florye, doughter to the kyn&gtee; of Armanye, which\nby the wy&llbar; of god is passed out of this world / and I\npray you that ye dayne to take this yefte, For it oughte\nnot to be refussed.'  'By my feyth, fayr brother and\nmy lord,' said guyon, 'I thanke you moche therof, and\nhym also that is causer of hit, on whos sowle god haue\nmercy.'  Thenne were the knyghtes of armanye joyfu&llbar;\n& glad.  And as soone as guyon had consentid therto,\nthey kneeled byfore hym & kyssed hys handes, after\nthe custome of theire lan&dtail; / And thanne bygan ayen\nthe feest greter than it was afore.  And in that meane\nsaison the kin&gtee; dide doo make hys nauye redy, that\nwas in to the porte of Lymasson, and in the vessels\nhe made to be putte grete rychesses / and guyon hys\nbrother, accompanyed with the maister of Rodes, & with\nmany barons of poytou and of Cypre, toke hys leue, &\nentred in to the see & saylled so lon&gtee; that they arryued\nin Armenye, where they were receyued honourably. There is an omission here; the French version opens a new chapter, entitled Comment Guion espousa la pucelle Florie et fut roy d'Armanie, as follows: \u2014 Adonc l'ung des barons d'Armanie parla moult hault addressant sa parole \u00e0 Guion, et dist: Sire, nous vous avons est\u00e9 querir pour estre nostre seigneur et nostre roy; si est bon que nous vous delivrons tout ce que nous vous devons bailler. Et voiez cy ma damoiselle qui est toute preste de acomplir tout ce que nous vous avons promis et au roy urian votre fr\u00e8re. Par foi, dist Guion, ce ne demourera mie \u00e0 faire pour moy; and continues then as above. There was guyon wedded with Florye / and after the\nfeste a&llbar; the barons of the lan&dtail; came to Cruly & made\ntheyre homage to guyon, whiche crownned himself\nking & regned honourably.  And after these thinges\ndoon the maister of Rodes & the barons of Poytou toke\ntheire leue of guyon, whiche yaf to them grete yeftes\nof ryches, & they entred in to theire shippes and rowed\ntyl they cam at Rodes, where as the said maister\nfestyed worshipfully the estraungers, and so dide al the\nknightes bretheren of hys relygyon.  And at thende\nof viii dayes the barons of Poytou entred agayn in to\nthe see, and in short tyme they arryued in Cipre, And\nrecounted to Vryan al the trouth of the fayt, and how\nhis brother guyon was honourably receyued in\narmanye / and how he had wedded Florye, and was crowned\nkyng of the lan&dtail; & loued of al the peple there,\nwherof moche thankes rendred guyon to god.  Within\nfew dayes after many of the knightes of poytou toke\ntheire leue, and to them yaf vryan grete yeftes of\nryches / and sent wor&dtail; by them in wrytyng to his\nfader & moder of al thestate & prosperous fortune of\nhym & of hys brother.  And thus departed the barons\n& entred in to theire shippes, whiche they fonde wel\npurueyed of al that was necessary to them, and toke\ntheire way toward Rochelle in poytou. This begins a new chapter in the French version, entitled, Comment les messagiers apport\u00e8rent les lettres \u00e0 Raimondin et \u00e0 Melusine de ses deux enfans qui estioent roix. Now sayth thystorye, that the barons of poytou\nsailled so lon&gtee; that they perceyued & sawe\nRochelle, where they arryued with grete joye / and there they refresshed them self the space of thre dayes,\nand after mounted on theire horses & rode toward\nLusynen, where they founde Raymondyn and Melusyne\nand theire other children with \u00feem, whiche receyued\nthem with grete joy.  And \u00feenne they delyuered to\nthem the lettres of kynges Vryan & guyon theire\nsones.  And whan they herde & vndersto&dtail; the tenour of\nthem they thanked god of the good auenture that he of\nhis grace had youen to theire two sones / and yaf grete\njewelles & ryche yeftes to the barons that brought\ntydyngis of \u00feem.  And that same yere melusyne fownded\nthe chirc&hbar; of our lady in Lusynen & manie other\nabbeyes in \u00fee lande, and endowed them with grete\npossessyons.  And thenne was the trayttee of maryage\nmade betwix Odon her sone and the Erle of marchis\ndoughtir, And was the feest grete & noble holden in\na medowe nygh to the Castel of Lusynen. / Thystorye sheweth here, that Anthony & Regnald\nwere right gla&dtail; whan they vnderstode the\ntydinges of the fortune & noble fayttes of armes of theire\ntwo bretheren / and that in so short space of tyme they\nhad sore adommaged the enemyes of god, and said one\nto other, 'My ryght dere brother, it is now tyme that\nwe goo seke auenture thrug&hbar; the world, For here to\ndwe&llbar; ony lenger we may not acquyre nor gete honour,\nas oure brethern Vryan & guyon haue don.'\nWherfore they come to theyre fader & moder, and to them\nsaid humbly in this manere, 'My lord and you my\nlady, yf ye vouchsaf it were tyme that we went thrugh\nthe world at our auenture, for to gete & acquere\nthordre if knyghthode as our bretheren vryan &\nguyon haue don / how wel we be nat worthy to receuye\nit so nobly nor in so noble a place as they haue doo /\nbut yf it playseth god our entencion is to endeuoyre\nvs \u00feerto.'  Thenne ansuer&dtail; to them Melusyne theire\nmoder, 'Fayre sones, yf that playseth wel your fader, I me consent to your requeste.'  'By my feyth, lady,'\nsaid Raymondyn, 'doo your wy&llbar; therof, For what\nsomeuer ye wyl I me consent therto.'  'Sire,' said\nMelusyne, 'it semeth to me good that from hens fourth\nthey begynne to take on them som vyage for to knowe\nthe world & the straunge marches / also to be renommed\n& knowen / and to knowe & discerne good from euyl.'\nThenne the two bretheren kneeled byfore theire fader\n& moder, & thanked them moc&hbar; humbly of the honour\nthat they promysed them to doo.  And here ceaseth\nthystory to spek of them / and speketh of another\nmatere. In this partye sayth thistorye, that in the marches\nof Allemayne, betwene Lorayne & Ardane, was a\nnoble Countrey, the which was somtyme called the\nErledome of Lucembourgh, and now it is named a\nduchye.  In that same Countree was some tyme a lord\nerle of the land, whiche after his decesse lefte a fayre\ndoughter his heyre / she was clepyd Crystyne, and her\nfader was named Asselyn.  Alle the barons of the land\nmade theire homage to her as to the rightfu&llbar; heyre of\nthe lande.  On that tyme was in Anssay a kynge\nwhos wyf was deed in her child bed at the birthe of a\ndoughter, whiche the fader made to be baptised &\nnamed Melidee.  Whan this kynge thanne herde how\nthe Erle of Lucembourgh was passed out of this world,\nand that none heyre he had but a doughter, whiche\nwas the fayrest damoyse&llbar; of a&llbar; the land / he sent in\nambaxade to her the moost noble & secretest men of\nhys Counsey&llbar;, to speke & treate the maryage of hym\nwith her.  But the pucelle Crystyne wold neuer\nconsent therto / wherfore he wexed sorowfu&llbar; in herte /\nand sware god that outhre by force or by her wy&llbar; he\nshuld haue her, whatsoeuer it might fa&llbar; therof.  Thenne\nmade he his mandement, & chalenged the mayde & alle\nher lande.  Whan thanne the barons & noble men of the lande & all the commynalte wyst it / they said\n& sware that syth theyre lady wold not haue hym to\nher lord / they shuld shewe to hym that he dide wrong\nto the pucelle and to them also.  And immediatly they\ngarnysshed theire Cites, tounes, & Fortresses. And\nthe moost part of the barons drew themself to the\ntoune & Castel of Lucembourgh with Cristyne, theire\nowne propre lady.  What shuld I make you long compte /\nthey were nat that tyme strong ne puyssaunt ynoug&hbar; for\nto fyght ayenst the kyng of Anssay.  For he came vpon\nthem with a grete puyssaunce of peple & moche\nadommaged the lande / and came al brennyn&gtee; vnto byfore\nthe toune & Fortresse of Lucembourg&hbar;, where he layed\nsiege.  And of faytte theire was grete scarmysshin&gtee; and\ngrete losse of one parte and of o\u00feer.  It happed thanne\nthat one of the noblest barons of the lan&dtail;, the whiche\nhad be with Vryan at the conqueste of the royaume of\nCipre, and euer was with hym at a&llbar; the baytay&llbar;es that\nhe had ayenst the paynemes / the whiche was come\nayen with the barons of Poytou vnto Lusynen / and\nhad receyued of Melusyne riche jewels & grete yeftes\nof ryches / and sawe there Regnald and Anthony, that\nwere moche strong and grete, & of fyers & hardy\ncontenaunce / and wel it semed to hym that they\nshuld ensiew condicions & maneres of theire\nbretheren, and theire high prowes & enterpryse / drew\nthe noble men of the land apart, and said to them in\nthis manere: 'Fayre lordes, ye may conceyue and wel\nperceyue that we may not hold longe ayenst the\npuyssaunce of the same kinge.  Wherfore yf it seme you\ngood, myn oppynyon were to see a remedy be had to it\nrather to fore than to late, For good it is to shette the\nstable or euer the horses be lost.'  And they ansuer&dtail;,\n'that is trouth / but we may not perceyue no remedy\ntherto without the grace of god be.'  'For southe,' said\nthe forsaid baron, 'Without godis grace none may but lytel or nought doo, but with that it is good to take\nayde who that may haue it.'  'Certaynly,' said the\nbarons, 'ye say right wel; yf ye thanne know some\ngentylman worthy to haue our lady, and valyaunt &\npreu to deffende vs ayenst our enemyes, lete vs knowe\nhym.  For ye be therto hold & bounden bycause of\nyour alygeaunce.'  This gentylman thanne reherced to\nthem fro hed to hed how vryan & hys brother departed\nfro Lusynen, and a&llbar; thauenture of theire vyage / also\nthestate of theire fader and moder / and ouermore, he\nshewed to them the fayre maynten & countenaunce of\nAnthony & Regnaul&dtail; / and that he knew for certayn /\nthat who so went to seke & requyre the socours and\nhelpe of the two bretheren, they shuld come with\ngrete puyssaunce, whan they shuld haue knowledge of\nthe faytte.  'By my feyth,' said the noblemen, 'ye say\nfu&llbar; wel.'  Thenne they fourthwith went tofore\nCrystyne theire lady, and worde to worde they recounted\nto her a&llbar; this affayre.  And she said to them, 'Fayre\nlordes, I recommande you my land and yours / doo\nwhat semeth you best to thonour of me and of you, for\nthe commyn wele of a&llbar; my land.  For wete it for\ncertayn, that for to dey or to be dysheryted, I shal not\nhaue the kyng of Anssay to my lord / how be it he is\nbetter than to me apparteyneth, but for asmoche that\nhe wyl haue by force me & my lan&dtail;.'  And they\nansuer&dtail; to her / 'doubte you not therof, my lady, For\nyf it playse god, he shal not haue so moche of\npuyssance as long as we sha&llbar; mowe stere our owne bodyes.'\n'Lordes,' said she, 'gramercy.'  And thenne they departed\nthens.  Thenne said one of the barons to the forsai&dtail;\ngentylman in this manere: 'ye that haue putte vs in\nthis quarelle / say now what best is for to doo.'  'By my\nfeyth,' said he, 'yf it lyke you good, ye sha&llbar; delyuere\nme two of you to goo with me to Lusynen, to wete yf\nwe can fynde there ony thin&gtee; to vs prouffytable.' Thenne they anoone chose amon&gtee; them, that is to wete,\ntwo of the wysest & noblest men for to goo with\nhym.  And they departed about the first slepe, mounted vpon\ngood & lyght horses, and yssued out of a posterne, and\npassed by that one side of thoost, so that they were neuer\nperceyued / and hasted them self on theire way toward\nLusynen.  And here cesseth thystorye of them, and\nspeketh of Meluysyne & her children, that is to wete,\nof Anthony and of Regnald. / Thystory sayth that the feste was right grete in\nthe medowe byforsaid / and men jousted there\nvalyauntly.  but aboue alle the yonge squyers that\nwere there, Anthony and Regnald dyde best after the\nsayeng & commendacion of the ladyes and gentyl\nwymen that were there.  And there were grete jewels\ngyuen.  but alwayes Melusyne thoughte to purueye to\nthestate of her children, and made to them fayre robes\n& ryche raymentes, and ordeyned and purueyed of men\nto goo with them, and in especial wyse, and noble men\nto endoctrine them, & shew to tham the way of good\ngouernaunce.  Duryng yet the feste, came there the\nambaxatours of Lucembourgh / \u00fee whiche made theire\nobeyssaunce to Raymondyn & to Melusyne ryght\nhonourably, and also to alle the companye / And joyously\nthey were receyued / & soone was there knowen the\nknight that had be with vryan at the Conqueste of\nCypre.  and he was honourably festyed, and of hym\ndemanded Anthony, for the wele that he herde saye of\nhym, yf it playsed hym to goo with hym & with hys\nbrother Regnauld in som vyage where he purposed to\ngoo, & to thayde of god, he shuld be wel\nrewarded.  The knyght thanne demanded of Anthony: 'My lord,\n& whither is your entencion for to goo?'  And he\nansuer&dtail;: 'At our auenture there as god shal conduyt\nvs, for to gete honour and cheualrye.'  'By my feyth,'\nsaid the knyght, 'I shal telle you the fayrest and the moost honourable auenture that euer gentylman had\nthat aduentured hym self, and the moost honourable\nenterpryse.'  And whan the two damoyseaulx vnderstod\nhym, they made moche of hym, & said in this manere:\n'Noble man, vouchesauf to vttre to vs that noble\nenterpryse that ye speketh of.'  'By my feyth, lordes,'\nsaid the knight, 'in as moche that I were ryght joyous\nyou to see enhaunsed in honour, also for to susteyne\nryght & reason, I shal ryght gladly shew to you a&llbar; the\nmatere therof. 'Ryght dere lordes, it is trout&hbar; that a&llbar; thoo that\nloue ryghtwysnes and that be wylling to gete\nhonour / they oughte to helpe and susteyne the wydowes\nan orphenyns.  And forasmoche, fayre lordes, it is soo\nthat in the marche of Lorayne & of Ardane is a moche\nryche & noble Countree that clepen the duchye of\nLucembourgh, the whiche duchye a noble man gouerned lon&gtee;\nas hys owne propre herytage / the whiche valyaunt man\npassed to god but of late, and hath lefte a doughtir hys\nheyre of the lan&dtail; / to the whiche right noble and fayre\npucelle alle the nobles and barons of the lan&dtail; haue as\nnow don theyre homage & obeyssaunce.  And where\nit is soo that the kynge of Anssay, knowyng the\nbeautefulnes of the mayde, and her grete & noble\nenherytaunce, hath demanded her by maryage / but that pucelle\nreffused hym bycause he had be wedded tofore, & of\nlate he was wydower.  Wherfore this kynge of Anssay\nhath deffyed her and al her land, and supposeth to\nhaue her by force & ayenst her wylle / and he is entred\nin to the land / and hath brent & slayn al byfore hym\nvnto the toune & Castel of Lucembourgh, where as\nhe hath now besieged the said lady, and hath sworne\nthat he sha&llbar; neuer departe thens vnto tyme he hath\nhis wylle of her, other by force or by loue.  Wherfore,\nlordes, me semeth that in a&llbar; the world nys more\nhonourable a vyage ne more raysonnable than that same is, For alle thoo that loue honour & gentylnesse ought to\ndraw them self that part.'  'In good feyth,' said thenne\nanthony, 'ye say trouth / and wete it I sha&llbar; shew this\nmatere to my lady my moder, to see what ayde and\nhelpe my lord our fader and she wyl gyue vs / and\nhow so euer it happeth, by thayde of god we sha&llbar; goo\nand socoure the pucelle that the kynge of Anssay wyl\nhaue by force, wherof me semeth that he is euyl\ncounseylled.'  'On my feyth, my lord,' sayd thenne the\nknight, 'yf ye vouchesauf to vndertake that vyage / I\n& my felawes, two knightes that be here come with\nme, shal conduyte & helpe you of al our power.'  And\n\u00fee two bretheren thanked them moche, & saide / 'no\ndoubte we shal goo thither, yf it be the playsire of\ngod' / And thenne they retourned toward theire moder /\nand the knight toward his felawes / and reherced to\nthem how he had exployted / and that no nede was\nto speke ne requere Raymondyn ne Melusyne\ntherof.  'Now, veryly,' said the two barons, 'it is ryght wysly\ndon of you / blessid be god therof.' / Here saith thistory, that Anthony & Regnald\ncame to theire fader & moder, and\ndenounced to them these tydinges, and requyred them\nof help & ayde tacomplysshe this enterpryse.  Thenne\nspake Raymondyn to Melusyne, & said, 'Certainly,\nlady, herto they  may haue a fayre begynnyn&gtee; in\narmes.  Wherfore I pray you that ye purueye for them in\nsuche wyse that we may haue therof honour &\nprouffyt.'  'For southe,' said Melusyne, 'Sire, for tacomplysshe\nyour wylle, I sha&llbar; endeuoyre me so diligently therto,\nthat bothe you & they also shal be content.'  And\nthenne she made that ony man that wold take wages\nvnder Anthony & Regnald of Lusynen, that they shuld\ncome at a certayn day to Lusynen, and there they shuld\nbe payed of \u00feeir wages for one yere / and also she\nmade it to be cryed al about the marches of poytou. / In this partye reherceth thystorye, that within the\nday that Melusyne made to be cryed and anounced\nthe said wages , were assemble&dtail; many gentylmen in a\nmeddowe bysyde Lusynen; and grete foyson men of\narmes, to the nombre of foure thousand helmets and\nfyue houndred, some archers & o\u00feer crosbowe men /\nand there were no pages, but al strong men / and were\nal lodged in fayre tentes & pauyllons, and so purueyed\nof all maner harneys & of al other thinges necessary to\n\u00feem, that euery man was content.  And while\nRaymondyn & melusyne payed them theire wages, &\npurueyed for al thinges that were nedefu&llbar; to theyre\nvyage / Anthony & Regnald araysonned & demanded\nof the said knight and of his barons, hys felawes, of\nthe estate of the pucelle of the lan&dtail; / And they said to\nthem the very trouth / and were joyfu&llbar; in theire hertes\nof the grete apparay&llbar; that they sawe so soone redy,\nFor wel they had take in thanke half of the same to\nsocoure with a&llbar; theire lady.  Wherfor \u00feey thanked\ngod & our lady his blessid moder, And sent fourth\nwith a messager toward the barons of Lucembourgh,\nfor to anounce to them the noble socours that god sent\nto them.  Wherof they were joyful & glad.  And aftir\nthe barons went & told to theire lady the tydynges, of\nthe whyche she was moc&hbar; recomforted, and bygan\nmoche deuoutely to lawde god her creatour.  And\nwhan the peuple knew therof, they had grete joye, and\nthanked god, and made grete fyres, and cryed with a\nmery voys, sayeng thus: 'Joye & victory to our\npucelle.'  And whan theire enemyes withoutforth her&dtail;\nthem, they wondred moc&hbar;, & went & denounced it to\ntheire kynge, wherof he was abasshed &\npensefu&llbar;.  And thenne came tofore certayn personnes, that said\nto hym: 'Sire, doo make good watche, For they of the\ntoune awayte dayly for socours.'  'By god,' said the kinge, 'I ne wot nor may knowe by no manere fro\nwhens socours shuld come to them; I doubte not / but\nthat I shal haue them at my wy&llbar;, other by strengt&hbar;\nor by honger and for lack of meete.'  And thus the\nkyng of Anssay assured hym self, But aftirward he\nfon&dtail; hym self deceyued.  Now I shal leue of hym,\nand shal retourne to speke of Melusyne and of her two\nsones. Melusyne thenne called to her Anthony and\nRegnald, her two sones / and to them she said in\nthis manere: 'Children, ye now wyl departe fro my\nlord your fader & fro me / and happely we shal neuer\nsee you agayn.  Wherfore I wyl teche & introdruyte\nyou for your wele & honour.  And I pray you that ye\nvnderstand & reteyne wel that I sha&llbar; say, For that\nshal be to you nedefu&llbar; in tyme to come.  First, ye\nshal loue / doubte, & preyse god our creatour; ye shal\nfermely, iustly, & deuoutly hold the commandementes\nof our moder holy chirche / and stedfast shal you be in\nour feyth catholical. / be ye humble & curteys to good\nfolke / fyers & sharp to the wicked & euyl folke / and\nbe ye alwayes of fayre ansueryng, bothe to moost and\nleste / and hold talkyng to euery one whan tyme\nrequyreth, without eny dysdayn / promyse ne\nbeheyghte nothin&gtee; but that ye may shortly acomplysshe\nit after your power; withdrawe not rapporteurs of\nwordes toward you / byleue not enuyous / nor beleue\nnot to soone ne lyghtly / For that causeth somtyme\nthe fren&dtail; to wexe mortal foo; putte not in office\nauarycyous nor folke / acoynte you not with\nanother mans wyf / departe or deele to your felawes of\nsuche thinges that god shal gyue you; be swete &\ndebonnaire to your subgects / and to your enemyes\nfyers & cruel vnto tyme they be subdued & vnder\nyour puyssaunce / kepe your self fro auauntyng & fro menace / but doo your faytte with few wordes this that\nmay be doo.  Despyse neuer none enemy, thaugh he\nbe lytel / but loke wel about and make good watche /\nbe not emonges your felawes as maister, but commyn\nwith them / and worship euerychon after his degre /\nand gyue to them after your power, & after that they\nbe worthy.  gyue to the good men of armes hors &\nharneys & syluer as rayson requyreth.  Now, my\nchildren, I ne wot nat what I shuld more saye to you /\nbut that ye kepe euer trouthe in al your dedes &\naffayres.  Hold!  I gyue eche of you a ryng of gold,\nwherof the stones ben of one vertue.  For wete it that\nas long as ye haue good cause, ye shal neuer be\ndyscomfyted in batay&llbar;.'  And thenne she kyssed them in\nmoderly wyse, whiche thanked her; and toke leue of\ntheire fader, that ryght dolaunt was of theire\ndepartyn&gtee;.  They made thenne theire troompettes to be sowned &\nblowen, and putte them self al byfore, & conduyted the\nauauntgarde / and after folowed the sommage & the\ngrete batay&llbar; in fayre aray / and the arryergarde also\nmarched forth in fayre ordynaunce.  It was a good\nsight to see the state of the vantgarde, whiche the two\nbretheren delyuered to be conduyted to a noble baron\n& valyaunt knight of poytou / and them self toke &\nconduyted the gret baytay&llbar; / and by them rode the\nambaxadours of Lucembourg.  And of the reregarde\nwere captayns the two knightes of poytou that ledd\nvryan & guyon in to Cypre, and that first told to them\nthat the sawdan had besieged the Cite of\nFamagoce.  And to these two knightes Raymondyn & Melusyne\nhad recommanded the estate of theire two sones,\nRegnald & Anthony.  And trouth it is, that on the first\nnyght they lodged them nygh to a strong toune vpon\na lytel ryuere / and was that same toune named\nMyrabel, \u00fee whiche Melusyne founded / and that same\nnyght bygan the two brethern to make good watche, as\nthey had be alredy in lan&dtail; of enemyes, wherof many\ngaf themself grete meruey&llbar;; but they durst not reffuse\nit, For Anthony was so cruel that euery man dra&dtail;\nhym.  On the morowe next after the masse was doo /\nthe two bretheren made cryees vpon peyne of hors &\nharyneys, & to be banysshed out of the felawship, \u00feat\neueryman shuld ryde armed vnder his banere, in good\naray of batay&llbar;.  none durst not refuse it / but thus was\nit doo,  Wherof they al merueylled.  And in this manere\nthey rode by the space of ten dayes, & so long that\nthey cam in champayne / and many one were wery &\nennuyed of theire harneys / as moche for \u00feis that it\nwas no nede / as bycause they were not acustomed of\nit / and som spake therof, wherfor the knight that\nconduyted the vangarde cam to the two brethern, & thus\nsaid to them: 'My lordes, the moost part of your\npeuple is euyl apayed & content bycause that ye constrayne them to bere theire harneys; For them semeth\nno nede to doo soo tyl that they come nygh to the\nmarches of your enemyes.'  'And how, sire,' said\nAnthony, 'thinke you not that the thinge whic&hbar; is\nacustomed of long tyme be bettre knowen of them that\nexercice it, & lesse greuable than that thin&gtee; whic&hbar; is\nnewly lerne&dtail;?'  'By my feyth, sire,' said the knyght,\n'ye say wel.' 'morouer,' said Anthony, 'It is bettre\nfor \u00feem to lerne the peyne for to susteyne theire\nharneys in tyme, that surely they may so doo at theire\nease, & to refresshe them surely for to essaye them\nself, and knowe the manere how they myght easy\nsusteyn & suffre it whan nede shalbe.  For yf they\nmuste be thaught of theire enemyes / theire peyne shuld be greter & doubtous / and ye wote ynoug&hbar;, that\nwho lerneth not his crafte in his yougthe, with grete\npeyne & har&dtail; it shal be for hym to be a good\nwerkeman in his ol&dtail; age.' 'Certaynly, my lord,' said the\nknyght, 'ye saye the playne trouth of it, and your\nreason is fu&llbar; good.'  And thenne he departed fro\nhym, and anounced to many one this rayson, in so\nmoche that knowlec&hbar; of it they had thorugh al thoost,\nwherof euery man held hym self wel apayed & content /\nand al sayd  that the two bretheren might not fay&llbar; to\nhaue grete wele, yf god wold sen&dtail; to them long lyf,\nand that they shuld come to grete perfection of honour. Thystorye sayth in this partye, that the same nyght\nthe oost was lodged vpon a ryuere that men\ncalled aisne / and about the first slepe, the two bretheren\nmade to be cryed alarme thrug&hbar; the oost right\nferfully.  Thenne was there grete trouble, and in euery syde they\narmed them, puttyn&gtee; themself in fayre aray of\nbatay&llbar;.  euery man vnder his banere byfore theire tentes.  And\nwete it wel, that it was grete beaute to see the good\ncontenaunce & the noble ordynaunce & fayre aray of\nthe men of armes, and of the two bretheren, that went\nfro batai&llbar; to batay&llbar; / and there as fawte was of\nordynaunce, they redressid theire peple to it.  And\nthe thre barons, ambaxadours of Lucembourgh, beheld\nwel theire maner & contenaunce, & said that one to\nthat other: 'On my feyth, these two children ben wel\nchappen to subdue & conquere yet a grete part of the\nworld / now wel may say the kin&gtee; of Anssay, that\ndere he sha&llbar; abye his folye & proude enterpryse, and\nthe dommage that he hath borne to our lady, & to\nher land & subgets.' In suche party they were long\ntyme, tyl the espyes that secretly were departed fro the\noost to dyscouere & ouersee the Countre about, yf\nenemyes were nygh / came agayn, & sayd that \u00feey aspyed no personne; whero[f] al gaf them self grete\nwonder of that alarme & affray, but at last it was wel\nknowen that the two bretheren caused it.  Thenne\ncame the two knightes, captayns of the arryergarde,\n& also the Captayne of the vantgarde, to the two\nbretheren, & said to them in this manere: 'My lordes,\ngrete symplenes it is to you thus to traueylle your\npeuple for nought.'  'How,' said Anthony to them /\n'whan ye doo make a new rayment, be it harneys or\nclothing, make ye not it to be essayed, for to knowe yf\nony fawte is fonde in it, and to haue it mended & sette\nas it shuld be?' / And they al ansuer&dtail;, 'For certayn,\nsire, ye / and that is ryght.'  Thenne sayd Anthony,\n'yf I wold haue assayed my felawes to fore that it had\nbe tyme, for to knowe how I shuld fynd them redy at\nmy nede / sene & consydered that we approuche our\nenemyes / to then&dtail;, yf ony fawte we had fon&dtail;, to\nhaue purueyed of conuenable remedy therto, at our\nlesse dommage / than yf in dede it had be.'  Whane\nthey heard that wor&dtail; / they ansuer&dtail; 'my lor&dtail;, ye\nsay but rayson' / and they wondred moche of theire\ngouernement, and of theire subtylte & wyt / sayeng\nbetwene them self / that they shuld yet come to grete\nperfection.  Soone after the day was come, the masse\nwas said and the trompettes sowned; at whic&hbar; sowne\nthe vantgarde marched fourth, and the sommage and\nCartes folowed / and after the grete oost deslodge&dtail; &\nwent so long by theire journeyes that they came &\nlodged them vpon a ryuere named Meuse, vnder a\nFortresse named Damcastel / And fro thens vnto the siege\ntofore lucembourgh, were not past two days journey\nfor them.  Thenne came the barons ambaxadours of\nLucembourgh to the two bretheren, & said: 'My lord,\nwe haue no more but xij leghis vnto the siege, it were\ngood that ye shuld refresshe your peple here vpon this fayre ryuer; For here is good soiourne & good abydyn&gtee; /\nand also is good to take aduys & Counseyl how ye wyl\ndoo.' / Thanne ansuer&dtail; Anthony ryght boldly: 'By my\nfeyth, fayre lordes, thaduys is ouerlong take,\nFor assoone that my brother & I haue sent toward the\nkynge of Anssay, yf he wyl not doo after our wy&llbar; he\nmay hold hym sure to haue batay&llbar; / and the vyctory\nshal send god to whom it playse hym / but what / me\nsemeth we haue good quare&llbar;, And therfor we haue\nhope on our lord that he shal helpe vs / and also we\nshal, or euer we fyght, demande of hym ryght &\nrayson / but it muste be aduysed who shal goo on the\nmessage.'  'By my feyth,' sayd the Captayne of the\nvantgarde, 'I shal be your messanger, yf it please you,\nand the gentylman that knoweth the Countre shal lede\nme thither.'  'In the name of god,' said anthony /\n'that playseth me ryght wel / but that shal not be tyl\nmyn oost be but thre leghes ferre fro them / to thende,\nyf \u00fee batay&llbar; muste be that we may be nere them for\nto fyght, and haue thayde of the toune with\nvs. For yf he wyl the batay&llbar; we wold be alredy by\nhym.'  And thus they lefte to speke of this\nmatere.  And on the morne erly, after that the masse was doo,\nthoost marched, & passed the ryuere vnder Damcastel\nin fayre ordynaunce / and so long they rode that they\narryued on an euen betwene vertone and\nLucembourgh, and there lodged them self.  And on the\nmorow erly Anthony sent the Captayne of the\nvantgarde, and the said gentylman toward the kynge of\nAnssay, to whom they said the wordes that herafter\nfolowe.  Thenne they hasted them so moche that they\ncame to the siege, and were brought as messagers\ntofore the kyn&gtee;, whome they salued, & made\nreuerence as they oughte / and aftir the knyght captayn\nsaid to hym in this manere: 'Sire, hither we be sent from our redoubted lordes, Anthony & Regnald, of\nLusynen bretheren, for to shew vnto you the fawte &\ngrete oultrage that ye doo to the noble damoyselle lady\nof Lucembourgh / the whic&hbar; our lordes redoubted\nmande, & lete you knowe by vs that yf ye wyl\nrestablysshe the dommage, & to make raysounable & lawful\namendes of the Iniury & vylonnye that ye haue don\nto her / to her subgets & to her propre enherytaunce,\nand after to departe out of her lan&dtail; ye shal doo wel,\nand they make them stron&gtee; to make your peas with\nher / and yf ye wyl not so deele with her / theire\nentencyon is for to take reparacion vpon you of the\ndommages beforsayd by strengthe of theire armes & by\nbatay&llbar;.  and gyue to vs an ansuere what your wy&llbar; is\nto doo / and after morouer I shal telle you as I am\ncommanded to doo.'  'How, sire knyght,' said the\nkyn&gtee;, 'are ye come hither for to preche vs / by my\nfeith lytel or nought ye may gete here.  For as to your\nlettres ne to your prechin&gtee;, I shal not be letted of myn\nentencion / but as long ye may preche as ye wyl, For I\nvouchesaf. For I take my dysport in your talkyng &\nprechement.  And also I trow that ye ne doo or saye\nsuche thinges but for dysport.'  'By my heed, sire,'\nsaid the Captayne, that was angry / 'yf ye doo not\npromptly & anoone this that our lordes mande by vs\nvnto you / the dysport that ye speke of / shal hastly\ntourne you to grete myschief & sorowe.'  'Sire knight,'\nsaid the kyn&gtee;, 'of menaces ye may gyue vs\nynoughe.  For other thin&gtee; ye shal not haue ne withbere fro me,\nFor your maisters, nor your menaces I preyse not\nworth a strawe.'  'Thenne, kin&gtee; of Anssay, I deffye\nyou on my ryght redoubted lordes byhalf.'  'Wel\nthanne,' said the kyn&gtee;, 'I shal kepe me fro mystakyng\n& fro losse & dommage, yf I may' / ' By my sowle,'\nanswer&dtail; the Captayne, 'grete nede ye shal haue to do soo.'  And without ony moo wordes they departed / And\nwhan they were out of thoost or siege / the gentylman\ntoke leue of the Captayne, and secretly entred in to\nthe toune for to recounte the tydinges of the two\nbrethern / and whan he came to the gate he was\nanone knowen, and the yate was opened to hym, &\ngladly he was welcommed of eueryone / and they\ndemanded tydynges of hym / whiche ansuer&dtail; to\nthem.  'Sires, make good chere, For soone ye shal haue the\nmoost noblest socours that euer was seen / and wete it\nwel that the kin&gtee; of Anssay abydeth so lon&gtee;, that he\nshal be certaynly othre slayn or take, & his peuple al\ndyscomfyted, take, or putte to deth.'  Thenne byganne\nthe joye to be so grete thrugh the toune that they\nwithoutforth herd the bruyt therof, and woundred moche\nwhat it might be / and announced it to the\nkyn&gtee;.  'By my feyth,' said the kynge, 'they recomforte\nthemself for the commyn&gtee; of thoo two children by whome\nthat knyght hat&hbar; deffyed vs, For as I trow, they\nhaue her&dtail; some tydynges therof, and \u00feerfor they make\nsuche joye.'  'In the name of god,' said an auncyent\nknight, 'al this may be / but good were to take heede\ntherto / For there nys none litel enmy, but we ought\nto haue doubte therof.  For I know them wel ynough\nby semblaunt.  For or euer they come hyther from\npoytou we shold haue brought about a parte of our\nwy&llbar;.'  Now I shal leue to spek of the kynge / and shal\nretourne to speke of hym that brought tydynges of the\ntwo bretheren in to the toune.  Whan the knyght\nthanne was entred as byfore is said, he went fourth\nvnto the Castel where the pucelle Cristyne was / and\nafter hys obeyssaunce don vnto her, he reherced to her\nal the playn trouth of the mayntene & countenaunce of\nthe two bretheren / and he said to her / 'how Anthony\nbare a claw of a Lyon in his face' / and shewed to her\nhys grete fyerste & his grete strengthe / Also how Regnald had but one eye / and the beaulte of theyre\nbodyes & of theire membres / wherof she merueylled\nmoche, & said that it was grete dommage, Whan eny\ncontreyfayture was in the membres of suche noble\nmen.  And now cesse thystory to speke of them / and\nretourneth to te&llbar; of the captayne that retourneth to\nthoost toward Anthony and Regnal&dtail;. / Thystorye sayth that so long rode the Captayne that he came in\nto thoost of the two bretheren, & recorded to them how he had\nfulfylled hys message, & recounted wor&dtail; by wor&dtail; the\nproude ansuere of the kin&gtee;, and how he had deffyed hym in theire\nbyhalf / and also how the knyght was departed fro hym, & was gon\nto Lucembourgh to te&llbar; there of\ntheire commyng / And whan the two bretheren her&dtail; hym they were\nfu&llbar; joyous / and soone made cryees thrughe theyre oost, that al\nthey that had no wy&llbar; for to fyght & abyde the batay&llbar;\nshuld draw themself aparte, & gaf to them leue to retourne agayn\nin theire Countrey / but they escryed them self with an hye voys.  'Ha\n/ a, franc demoyseaux make your trompettes to be sowned, & lete vs\ngo forth vpon your enemyes / For we ben not come in your companye /\nbut for to take thauenture with you suche as god shal sen&dtail; vs /\nHa, lordes, goo we & renne vpon our enemyes, For with goddes\ngrace, & with the goo&dtail; wy&llbar; that we be of, they shal\nsoone be dyscomfyted.'  Whan thenne the two bretheren her&dtail; the\nansuer&dtail; of theire peple they were joyfu&llbar;, and made theire\noost to &dtail;eparte, & came & lodged vpon a lytel ryuere /\nand the vantgarde & the grete batai&llbar; lodged togidre, bycause\nthey might goo no fer\u00feer / and they soupped togidre, and after\nwent to reste them, & made good watche / and at day spryng they\nwere al redy / and lefte to kepe their lodgis two houndred men of\narmes with an one hundred crosbowes / and thenne the\noost in fayre aray marched forth.  There myght men see baners & standarts in the wyn&dtail;, and vnder them the\nflour of cheualrye in good aray & fayre ordynaunce /\nthere had ye sene salades & helmets shynyng clere /\nand harneys knokyng togidre that grete beaute it was\nto see.  They kept & marched nygh togidre, so that\none passed not that other.  And Anthony and Regnauld\nrode at the first frount, mounted vpon two grete horses\narmed of a&llbar; pieces.  And in that estate and aray they\nwent tyl they came vpon a lytel mountayne / and\nsawe fro thens in the valey the toune & Castel of\nLucembourgh, and the gret siege that aduyrouned it\nabout.  And wete it \u00feat they of the siege had not yet\nperceyued thoost of the two bretheren / but they were\nall asured \u00feat they shuld haue the batay&llbar;.  Thenne\nsent anthony foure houndred helmets for to scarmysshe\nthe siege / and the oost folowed with lytel paas\nin fayr aray of batay&llbar; / And on the wynges of\nthoost were knightes and Crosbowes in fayre\nordynaunce.  Now te&llbar; we of the foure houndred fyghtin&gtee;\nmen that went for to scarmyss&hbar; with them of the\nsiege. / Thystory saith that the foure houndred fyghtyng\nmen entred vpon theire enemyes, and slew &\nhew doune a&llbar; that they recountred / And whan they\nwere come nygh to the kingis tente, they of the night\nwatche that were not yet vnarmed went ayenst them, for\nthe cry that they made that was 'Lusynen' / many sperys\nwere putte there a&llbar; to pieces, and many one cast doune\nto the groun&dtail; / and the gretest dommage tourned vpon\nthem of the siege / but sodaynly the kyng armed hym\nself, and putte hym vnder his banere byfore his tente /\nand whiles they held foot alle thoost was armed, &\ndrew them toward the kyngis banere.  And he\ndemanded of them, 'Fayre lordes, what affray is this?'\n'By my feyth,' said a knight, 'they are men of armes\nthat entred in your oost ryght fyersly, and they ca&llbar; Lusynen, and they haue adommaged you sore / and yf\nit had not be the nyght watche the losse had be greter,\nFor they haue faught with them valyauntly / and haue\nmade them to goo back by force.'  'By my feyth,' said\nthe kynge / 'these damoyseaulx, in whos behalf I am\ndeffyed, haue not taryed long to come & bere\ndommage to me / but wel I think for to auenge me therof.'\nThenne is come Anthony and his batay&llbar;, whic&hbar; made\nhis trompettes to be sowned clerly.  And whan the\nkyng perceyued them he came withforth the lodgis\nin fayre aray & batay&llbar; renged.  And thenne the\nbataylles recountred eche other / and archers &\ncrosbowemen approuched & bygan to shoote, and there were\nslayne & hurt many one of the kin&gtee; of Anssays party,\nand neuertheles the grete batay&llbar; assembled togidre /\nand there was grete occysion & fyers medlee.  And\nthenne anthony broched his hors with the sporys, the\nspere alowed, & smote a knyght by suc&hbar; vertue that the\ntarge nor his cote of stele might not warauntyse hym,\nbut that he threw hym doune to therthe al\ndeed.  And thenne he drew out his swer&dtail;, and smote on the\nlyfte syde & on the ryght syde, gyuyng grete & pesaunt\nstokes, in so moche that in a short while he was so\nknowen thrugh al the batay&llbar; that the moost hardy\nof them alle durst not abyde hym.  Thenne came\nRegnald mounted vpon a grete Courser callyng\n'Lusygnen,' whic&hbar; made so grete appertyse of armes that alle\nhis enemyes redoubted hym.  Thenne was the baytay&llbar;\nfyers, cruel, and mortal on bothe partyes / but alwayes\nthe gretest losse & dommage tourned vpon the kyng of\nAnssay & his peple, whic&hbar; was moche dolaunt &\nsorowfu&llbar;, & envertued hym self strong, and made with his\nhandes grete vasselage / but al that preuaylled hym\nnought, For the poytevins were ryght stron&gtee;, hard, &\nfel lyke lyons / and theire were the two lordes so\npuyssaunt that none so bol&dtail; was there that durst abyde them.  Thenne sawe wel the kynge by the puyssaunce\n& strengt&hbar; of the two brethern, that he myght no lenger\nsuffre theire force.", "25": "Cap. XXV. How Anthony & Regnald dyscomfyted the kynge of Anssay tofore lucembourgh / and how he was take. The kyn&gtee; thenne, whic&hbar; was a valyaunt man &\nstron&gtee;, cryed with a hye voys 'Anssay, Anssay,\nlordes & barons be not abasshed, For the batay&llbar; is\noures' / and at his callyn&gtee; his peuple toke courage, &\nassembled them self ayen togidre about theire kynge,\nand made a fyers enuahye vpon the poyteuyns / there\nwas many man slayn / hewen & sore hurte with grete\ndoleur.  That mornyn&gtee; was fayre & clere, & the\nsoonne shoone bright vpon the helmets / and caused\nthe gold & syluer ther on to resplendysshe, that fayre\nit was to see.  And they of the toune that herde this\ngrete affray, toke theire armes; & eche of them made\ngood watche, For they were ryght ferdfu&llbar; & doubtous\nof treson.  And the knyght whic&hbar; anounced to them\nthe socours of the two bre\u00feer&nmacr; was with the pucelle\nCrystyne in a hye toure, & loked out at a wyndowe /\nand he knew wel that it was Anthony & Regnald, that\nwere come for to fight ayenst the kin&gtee; and his peple,\n& anon called with an hye voys, 'My lady, c&omacr;me\nhither & see the floure of knyghtho&dtail;, of prowesse &\nhardynes / c&omacr;me & see honour in his siege roya&llbar;, &\nin his mageste / c&omacr;me & see the god of armes in\npropre figure.'  'Frend,' said the pucelle / 'what is\nthat ye say to me?'  'I calle you,' sayd the knight,\n'to come hither & see the flour of noblesse & of a&llbar;\ncurtoysye, that fro ferre land is come hither for to\nfyght with your enemyes for to kepe your honour, your lande, & your peple / this are the two children of\nLusynen, that be c&omacr;me for to deffend you ayenst the\nkin&gtee; of Anssay & a&llbar; his puyssaunce, and to putte\ntheire honour & lyf in auenture for to kepe your\nhonour sauf.'  Thenne came the mayde at the\nwyndowe, & beheld the mortal batay&llbar; & horryble medlee /\nsayeng in this manere: 'O Veray god, what sha&llbar; doo\nthis pouere orphenym / bettre it had be that I had\ndrowned myself, or that I had be putte to deth in\nsome other wyse, or elles that I had be deed whan I\nyssued out of my moders wombe / than so many\ncreatures shuld be slayne & perysshe for myn owne\nsynne.'  Moche dolaunt & heuy was the yon&gtee;\ndamoyselle of the grete myschief that she sawe, For in\ncertayn thoccysyon was grete on bot&hbar; partyes, For the\nking recomforted his peuple by his wo[r]\u00fey\ncontenaunce & valyaunt maynten; For with his propre swer&dtail;\nhe moc&hbar; adommaged his enemys poyteuyns. But\nAnthony, seeyng the grete dommage that the kynge\nbare vpon his peple / he was dysplaysed with, & sayd\nin hym self: 'By my feyth, thy lyf or myn shal not\nbe lon&gtee;, For rather I wold dey than to suffre & see my\npeuple so murdryd before me.'  Thenne he sporyd hys\nhors / and fyersly as a lyon rane vpon the kin&gtee;.  and\nwith his swer&dtail; of stele smote hym vpon the hyest part\nof his helmet by suche strengt&hbar; & vertue that he made\nhym to be enclyned vpon \u00fee hors neck, so sore astonyed\nthat he ne wyst whe\u00feer it was nyght or day, nor he\nhad no force ne power to helpe ne redresse hymself\nvpward / and Anthony that this sawe, putte his swer&dtail;\nin the shethe ayen; & toke the king by the middes of\nthe body / drew hym fro the hors, & so rudely cast\nhym to therthe that vnnethe hys herte brake within\nhis bely / and after toke hym to foure knightes, and\ncharged them on theire lyues that they shuld kepe\nhym, so that \u00feey myght ansuere hym of it.  And they said that so shuld they doo / and they thanne bonde\nhym & lede hym out of the batay&llbar;, and called xxv ti archers with them.  And after these thinges thus doon\nAnthony retourned in the prees, callyn&gtee; 'Lusynen'\nwith a hye voys, & said: 'Now lordes & barons, gyue\ngrete strokes, & spare none, For the journey is ours\nthankyn&gtee; be to god; For I haue take the kynge of\nAnssay my prysonner, that so grete vylonny ha\u00fe don\nto the gentyl pucelle Cristyne.'  Thenne was the\nmedlee rude & paryllous / and there dide the bretheren\nso moche of armes, that al tho that saw them said that\nthey sawe neuer two so valyaunt knyghtes.

And there gate the poytevyns grete conqueste &\nnoble proye, and lodged them self in the pauyllons &\ntentes of the king of Anssay & of hys peple.  And\nwas the kinge brought in Anthonys tente, whic&hbar; a\nlytel byfore was hys owne propre tente; wherfore the\nkin&gtee; myght not hold his owne tonge, but said: 'By\nmy feyth, damoyseaulx, wel sayth he trouth that sayth /\n\"that god doth / he doth anoone\" / For this day, in\nthe mornyng, men had doo here within but lytel for\nyour commandement.'  'Sire,' sayd Anthony, 'your\nfolyshnes & synne is cause therof; For tofore ye wold\nrauysshe by force the pucelle Crystyne lady of this\ntoune / but therof ye sha&llbar; be payed after your\ndeserte, For I shal yeld your self vnder her\nsubgection.'

Thenne called Anthony to hym the two barons,\nambaxadours that were come to Lusynen, with\nthe said gentylman fro Lucembourgh and xx ti . other\nknyghtes of poytou, and to them said in this manere:\n'Now lede me this kinge tofore \u00fee damoyselle Crystyne,\nand recommande vs moche vnto her / and that we sen&dtail;\nher / her enemy prysonner, for to do with hym her\nwy&llbar;.' And thenne they departed, & lede the kin&gtee; as\nthey were youen in commandement / and came to the\ntoune, where they were wel festyed & honourably\nreceyued.  And thenne the Citezeyns conduyted them\ntowar&dtail; the pucelle, theire lady Crystyne, with grete\njoye.  'Noble lady,' said the messagers, 'the two yong\ndamoyseaulx of Lusynen recommande them hertyly\nvnto you, and send you this kyn&gtee; your enemy\nprysonner, to doo with hym after your dyscrecyon &\nwylle.'  'Fayre lordis,' ansuer&dtail; the damoyselle / 'herto\nbehoueth gret guerdon / but I am not puyssaunt\nynough for to rewar&dtail; them as they haue deseruyd.  I\npray to god deuoutely that of hys grace he wyl rewarde\nthem to whom I am moc&hbar; bonden / and I pray you,\nfayre lordes, that on my behalf ye wyl pray my two\nyong lordes that they vouchesauf to come and lodge\nthem self here within, & as many of theyre barons\nwith them as it shal lyke them good.  & in \u00fee meane\nwhile men shal burye the deed bodyes, & the deed\nhorses shal be brent / and also they of my Counseyl\nshal take theire best aduys to see how I shal reward\nthem of theire grete peyne & traueyl, that they haue\nsuffred for me vnworthy \u00feerof, and to recompense\nthem of theire grete expenses & dommages in the best\nwyse that we can or shal mowe.  And ye, kynge of\nAnssay, ye swere vnto vs by your ryalte that ye shal not departe from hens without the wy&llbar; & gree of the\ntwo noble damoyseaulx, that here haue sent you toward\nme.  For yet so moc&hbar; I knowe / thankyng to god /\nthat I shuld mysdoo to cast you in pryson / not for\nyour sake / but for loue of them that hither haue sent\nyou.'  Whan thenne the kynge vnderstode the wordes\nof the pucelle, he ansuer&dtail; al ashamed, 'Noble\ndamoyselle, I swere you on my feyth that neuer hens I shal\ndeparte without your leue & theirs also; For so moc&hbar;\nof wele / of honour & of valyauntnes I haue sene in\nthem, that moche I desyre to be acoynted with them /\nhow be it that grete dommage they haue borne vnto\nme & my men.'  And thenne the noble mayde made\nhym to be putte into a fayre chambre & riche, & with\nhym ladyes & damoyselles, also knyghtis & squyers,\nfor to make hym to forgete his losse, & forto reioye &\nhaue hym out of melencolye.  And thus don, the\nmessagers retourned toward the tentes, & reported the\nmandement & prayer of the pucelle Cristyne vnto the\ntwo bretheren, whiche were counseilled to goo thither;\nand ordeyned the mareshal of the oost for to gouerne\ntheire peple vnto tyme that they came agayn / and\nalso he commanded hym to make the deed bodyes to\nbe buryed, & to make the place clene where as the\nbatay&llbar; had be.  Thenne they departed, acompanyed\nwith theire baronnye / and ayenst them came, in theire\nbest wyse, an houndred gentylmen / and also the\nbarons of the lan&dtail; mete with them, & made theire\nobeyssaunce fu&llbar; honourably vnto the two brethern,\nprayeng them yet agayn, on theire ladys behalf, that\nthey vouchesauf to come & lodge them in the toune /\nAnd they ansuer&dtail; that gladly they wold doo\nsoo.  Anthony was mounted vpon a grete Courser / and he\nhad on hym a jacke of Cramesyn velvet, a&llbar; brouded &\nsette with perlis, and held a grete vyreton in his\nhand.  And in lyke & semblable manere went hys brother Regnauld.  And whan the barons of Lucembourgh\nsawe the two brethern, they wondred moc&hbar; of theire\nfyersnes, gretnes & myght, and wel said that there\nwas no man that might withstand ne abyde theire\npuyssaunce / and moche they merueylled of the Lyons\nclaw that appiered in Anthonys cheke, & said that yf\nne had be that he were the fayrest man in the world /\nand moche they playned Regnald of that he had but\none eye, For in al his other membres he passed of\nbeaulte al o\u00feer men. In this partye sayth thistorye, that in noble estate &\nfayre aray entred the two brethern in to the toune\nof Lucembourgh; & before them sowned trompettes in\ngrete nombre, with heraults & menestrels; And\nCyteseyns had hanged theire houses withoutforth toward\nthe stretes, with theire best & rychest hangyng clothes /\nand the stretes where the said lordes passed were\ncouered on high with lynen clothes, that no rayne or\nother fow&llbar; wedryng myght lette \u00feeire entree within the\ntoune / and many noble & worshipful ladyes, bourgeys\nwyues / damoyselles and fayre maydens, were in theire\nbest rayments, eche one after the state & degree that\nshe was of / lokyng out at wyndowes for to behold &\nsee the noble brethern & theire felawship. Thystorye thanne sayth that the two bretheren\ndeparted out of theire tentes with noble companye,\nas barons, knightes, squyers, & other gentylmen /\nand as vyctoryous prynces rode fu&llbar; honourably vnto\nLucembourgh, and thrug&hbar; the toune, where as they\nwere behold with joyous herte of euery one, sayeng\nthat one to other: See yonder be two the fyers men,\nbretheren that are to be redoubted / he is not wyse\nthat taketh noyse or debat with them / and they had\ngrete wonder of Anthonyes cheke / and also for certayn\nit was a straunge thin&gtee; to behold & see / but the grete\nbeaulte that was in his body caused that\ninconuenyence to be forgoten / And thus they rode toward the\nCastel.  The ladyes & damoyselles behel&dtail; them out of\nthe wyndowes / and said that they neuer sawe two\ndamoyseaulx of more noble affayre.  And thenne they\ncame to the Castel, wher they alighted, and entred\nfourthwith into the ha&llbar;, where as the noble Crystyne\nmete them at the gate, wel acompanyed of ladyes &\ndamoyselles in grete nombre, and of knightes & squyers /\nand with a joyous contenaunce & gracyous maynten\nhonou- rably receyued them & gretly festyed\nthem.  The halle was hanged nobly with ryche clothes after\nthe vse of the lan&dtail;, and fro the halle they went in to\nanother chambre, moc&hbar; noble & ryche, & \u00feere the\npucelle Cristyne bygan to say to them in this manyere:\n'My right dere lordes, I thanke you moc&hbar;, as I may\nof the noble socours & help that ye haue don to me / I\nam not so moc&hbar; worth as ye ought to be rewarded of /\nnot that withstanding I sha&llbar; endeuoyre me therto / al\nshuld I laye of my lan&dtail; in pledge this tene yere\nday.  And also, my lordes, of your noble grace ye haue sent\nto me the kin&gtee; of ans&smacr;ay, myn enemy, of the whic&hbar;\nplaise it you to knowe that I am not she to whom\noughte \u00fee punysshement of hym / but to you\napparteyneth to doo therwith your playsire & volente, that\nhaue had the parel & peyne for to ouercome & take\nhym your prysonner / wherfore after that right\nrequyreth he is yours, & may doo with hym whatsoeuer\nit plaise you / and I remyse hym in your\npocession.  For as touching my persone I gyue hym ouer vnto you,\n& loke not to medle ony more with him tofore\nyou.'  'Noble damoyselle,' said thanne anthony, 'sethen it is\nyour playsire, we shal ordeyne wel \u00feerof, in suche wyse\nthat it shal be to your grete honour & prouffyte / and\nto hym grete shame & confusyon / no doubt of / And\nwete it that my bro\u00feer and I are not c&omacr;me hither for\nloue of your siluer, but for to susteyne rayson & right / also considered that alle noble men oughte to helpe &\nayde the wydowes, orphenynis, and the pucelles\nalso.  And forasmoc&hbar; also that we were truly informed, that\nthe kinge of Anssay made grete werre anenst you &\nyour land wrongfully, wherfor no doubte of / of a&llbar;\nyour goodes we wyl not take the value of one peny /\nbut alonly to be receyued in your noble fauour &\ngood grace, a&llbar; vylounye excepted.'  Whan the pucelle\nCristyne vnderstode these wordes, she was abasshed of\nthe grete honour that the two bretheren dide vnto her /\nnot that withstandyng she ansuer&dtail; in this manere:\n'For southe, my gracyous lordes, at lest it were no\nraison, but that I payed wel your peple that be come\nhither to take your wages as sawdoyers.'  'Damoyselle,'\nsaid \u00feenne Anthony, 'vouchsaf to suffre that we haue\nsaid, For my lord our fader, & my lady our moder,\nhaue payed them alredy for a hole yere day, or euer\nthey departed out of our land / & yet it is not fullyss&hbar;\na moneth complet syn that we departed thens; And\nouermore wete it that syluer & gold we haue\nynoughe.  Wherfore, noble demoyselle, ye lese your wordes to\nspeke therof, For certayn it shal none other be' / and\nshe thenne thanked them in her best manere ryght\nhumbly. Thenne came the styward, & enclyned hym tofore\nthe pucelle, & said: 'My lady, ye may wesshe\nwhan it playse you, For al thing is redy to dyner' /\n'whan, my lordes,' she said, 'be redy \u00feerto, I am\nplaysed.'  Whom Anthony ansuer&dtail;: 'noble\ndamoyselle, we be al redy whan ye vouchesaf to go\ntherat.' and thenne they toke eche other by \u00fee handes &\nwesshe.  And Anthony desired the king of Anssay to be sent\nfor / and made hym sette first of a&llbar; at the table / and\nafter the pucelle and syn Regnauld / and anthony satte\nlast.  And nygh to them satte foure of the noblest\nbarons of the land.  And along the halle were other tables dressed, wherat sette a&llbar; other gentylmen, barons\n& squyers, eche one after hys degree.  Of the seruyse\nI nede not to hold you long compte, For they were so\nnobly & haboundauntly serued, that nothing accordyng\nto suc&hbar; a rya&llbar; feste they wanted of.  And whan they\nhad dyned they wesshe handes, and graces were sai&dtail;,\nand all the tables voyded. thanne said the kin&gtee; of\nAnssay in this manyere: 'Lordes damoyseaulx,\nvouchesauf to here my wordes.  It is trouth that the wy&llbar; of\ngod & myn vnfortune hath brought me to that caas,\nthat by your valiauntnes & prowes I am & haue be\nbothe myself & al my peple dyscomfyte, & ouer that ye\nhaue take me your prysonner / but I ensure you,\nconsideryng your hig&hbar; prowesse, your bounte, & your\nnoble affayres, I am glad & joyous to fynde me now\nwith you, For I shal be the bettre therfore al my lyf\nnaturel; and syth, fayre lordes, \u00feat my presence & lon&gtee;\nabydyn&gtee; here with you may nought preuaylle to you /\nhumbly I besec&hbar; you, as I best can, that it playse you\nto putte me to raisounable raunson & payement\nportable to me, so that I be not al dystroyed nor\ndysheryted / thaug&hbar; it lyeth now in your power / but\nhaue pyte on me, & punysshe me not aftir the regarde\nof my follysshe enterpryse / how be it \u00feat rygour of\njustice requyreth it.'  'By my hed,' said Anthony,\n'who that shuld punysshe you after the regarde of the\ngrete iniurye, vylonnye, & dommage that ye haue don,\nand yet had purposed to do to this noble damoyselle\nwithout eny lawful cause / ye were not puyssant to\nmake amendes suffysaunt therof / but for as moche that\nye knowleche your synne the lasse penytence shal ye\nhaue / and I wyl wel that ye knowe that my brother\n& I be not come from our countre hither for hoop of\ngetyng of siluer vpon you nor vpon other / but for\ndesire & hope of getyng of honour & good fame or\nrenommee, without to haue ony wy&llbar; or appetyt to haue mortal rychesses.

'By my\nfeyth,' said she, 'I consent me therto, syn it is my\nlordes plaisure' / and yet morouer said Anthony suche\nor semblable wordes as folowen / 'Yet, sire, I haue not al said that ye muste doo, For\nye muste doo founde a Pryoure of twelue\nmonkes & the pryour, in suche place there as my lady\nshal ordeyne / and ye shal endowe & empossesse them\nwith rentes & reuenue conuenable for theire lyuyng &\nfor their successours for euermore / the said monkes &\npryour to pray there for the sowles of them that haue\nbe slayne of your part & of myn in this batay&llbar;.'  'By\nmy feyth,' said thenne the kin&gtee;, 'I promyse you \u00feat\nso shal I doo, and good pledges & hostages I shall gyue\nyou, & to my lady to be asured therof.'  Thenne sware\nthe kynge by hys feyth vpon the holy Euaungiles that\nhe shuld hold & accomplysshe al that beforesaid is / &\ngaf & delyuered good hostages / & lettres patentes were therof made vnder hys seal, & the seales of a&llbar; the barons of his lande.

Thenne they embraced & kyssed eche other, takyng leue one of other / and syn departed the\nduc & came to hys peuple, and made his trompettes\nto be sowned.  Thenne mounted spere men on\nhorsback, and bygane euery man to marche forth in fayre\naray.  The vantgarde conduyted & lede the kynge of\nanssay and Regnald with hym, whic&hbar; was mounted\nvpon a hye Courser, armed of al pyeces except his\nhelmet, and held a grete staf in hys fyst, and putte\nhis men in ordre ful wel, & semed wel to be a prynce\ncourageous & of hye enterpryse / and after folowed the\nCartes, Charyots & bagage, & the grete batay&llbar; / and\nafter siewed the ryergarde, whic&hbar; Anthony conduyted\nin fayre ordynaunce of batay&llbar;, For it was tolde hym\n\u00feat in that countre were many theevys / but the duc\nAnthony manded, & sent word fro fortresse to fortresse\nthat yf they were so bold to take on hym or on hys\npeuple only thin&gtee;, that he shuld punysshe them in\nsuche wyse that other shuld take ensample\ntherof.

And on the morne erly, the Duc entred\ninto the Cite with hym, two houndred men of armes /\nand made his cryees, vpon peyne of deth, that none\nwere so hardy to take ony thin&gtee; of them of the toun;\nbut he payed wel for after raison.  And soone after\npassed the vantgarde in fayre aray ouer the bridge, and\nso fort&hbar; thrug&hbar; the Cyte.

And that nyght\nthe Duc & grete part of his baronnye lodged within the\nCyte, where as grete honour was doon to them.  The duc Anthony bode at souper with hym a&llbar; the ladyes\nof the Cyte, & festyed them ryght honorably, & gaf\ngrete yeftes ar he departed in so moche that they of\nthe Cyte wysshed hym to be theire lord.

And on the morne as he came from the\nmasse, & commanded the trompettes to be sowned for\nto departe & meve / there came fro the Cite foure\nknightes wel mounted on horsbak, & armed of a&llbar;\npyeces sauf the helmet, whiche alyghted byfore the\nduckes tente with foure houndred men of armes, and\nC crosbowe men in theire felawship.  These knightes\nmade their obeyssaunce / and syn sayd in this manere:\n'Right noble & puyssaunt duc, the Cite & commynalte\nof Coloyne recommande them to your good grace /\nand where as \u00feey haue sene so moche of noblesse &\ncurtoysye in you / desyryng right affectuelly to be\nfrendes & alyez vnto you, they sen&dtail; you foure hondred\nmen of armes & an C crosbowes, al payed of theire\nwages for tene monethis day, for to goo with you\nwhere so euer it playse you to goo.'

To that ansuerd the\nDuc & said / 'this that ye'say hurteth not our affayre,\nand I gaynsay not your sayen&gtee;, whan tyme\nshalbe.'  Thenne he putte them in ordynaunce, and receyued\nthem vnder his banere.  And \u00feenne desloged the\nvantgarde, the grete batay&llbar;, & the ryeregarde, and marched\non theire waye in fayre aray so lon&gtee;, that they entred\nin the lan&dtail; of Bavyere, nygh to a grete Cite named\nNuenmarghe, where as the Duc of Ode was with a\ngrete companye of peuple, For he doubted the kyng\nZelodus of Craco, that had besieged the kynge\nFederyke of Behayne, and held hym in grete necessite,\nFor he had with hym foure score paynemes / and the\nDuc Ode was doubtous lest he shuld come vpon hym,\nyf he subdued and dyscomfyted the kyng\nFederyke.  And therfore, he had assembled hys Counseyl to knowe\n& see what best was to doo. / Thenne cam to the Cite an auncyent knyght that\nwas of the Duc Ode, to whom he said after his\nobeyssaunce made: 'My lord, by my sowle I come\nfrom the marches of Almayne / but there is commyng\na grete oost hitherward of the moost goodlyest men of\narmes and best arayed that euer I sawe in my dayes /\nbut I wot not where they purpose to goo / but so\nmoche I know, that they draw them self\nhitherwar&dtail;.'  'By my feyth,' said the Duc, 'I gyue me grete wonder\nwhat folke they may be, yf the king of Anssay had not\nbe of late dyscomfyted tofore Lucembourgh, I shuld\nsuppose that it were he that wol&dtail; socoure his brother\nFederyke ayenst the Sarasyns / and on my sowle yf it\nwere he I shuld goo with hym for to helpe his\nbrother.'  'My lord,' said the knyght, 'it were wysely doo to haue\nknowleche certayn what folke they be, ne yf they\npurpose other wyse than wele.'  'Sire knyght,' said thanne\nthe Duc, 'ye muste your self goo to knowe & reporte the certaynte of it, syn ye haue sene them' / And he\nansuerde, 'By my feyth, my lord, I am redy\ntherto.'  And soone he departed, and so lon&gtee; he rode that he\nperceyued thoost in a valey by a ryuere.  There he\nsawe grete companyes of gentyl men here & there,\nsome castyn&gtee; the barre of yron / other held theire\nspere & shild and esprouued them self that one on \u00feat\nother / some assayed theire harneys with shoot, with\nstrokes of swerdes, and in many other appertyse of\narmes they exercyted them self.  'By my feyth,' said\nthenne the knight / 'there is fayre mayntene and noble\ncontenaunce of men of armes / suche folke is to be\ndoubted and dredde.'  Thenne he loked on the ryght\nsyde vpon a lytel mountaynne & sawe the grete batay&llbar;,\nand sawe the watche and the scourers al about the\noost.  'By my feyth,' said the knight that moche thing\nhad sene in his dayes / 'this ben worthy men of\nwerre and able to subdue ony lande.'  And thenne he\nentred in to thoost / and demanded after hym that had\nthe gouernaunce & guydyng of it / And soone he was\nbrought tofore Anthony.  And whan he saw the Duc\nhe was moche abasshed of his facion / but alwayes he\nsalued hym ryght curtoysly / and syn said to hym,\n'My lord, the Duc Ode hath sent me toward you to\nwete of you what ye seeke in hys lan&dtail; / and yf ye thinke\nor purpose other wyse than wele / also what ye be that\nconduyteth so fayre company of peuple that I see here\nassembled.

'Sire,' said\nthauncyent knyght, 'god graunte you good vyage.'  And so\nhe departed and retourned toward the Duc Ode of\nBauyere, to whom he reherced as aboue is said, and\nshewed hym the fyersnes and facion of Anthony, and\nthe contenaunce of his oost / sayen&gtee; that they were\nfolke to be redoubted & dre&dtail;.  'By my feyth,' said\nthenne the duc Ode, 'It commeth of noble courage to\nthat two bretheren to haue come fro so ferre lande\nfor to seke auenture of cheualerye & honour, and also\nfor to come & gyue ayde & socour to kynge Federyke\nanenst the enemyes of god / and I promyse god that\nshal not be without me, For it shuld be tourned to me\nto grete shame yf that I went not thither / seeyng that\nhe is my Cousyn, & that my land is so nygh his\nroyalme / and that the straungers come fro so ferre\nfor to ayde & helpe hym ayenst the paynemes.'  And\nthenne had the Duc Ode made his mandement but of\nlate, and had assembled al redy foure thousand fighting\nmen.  What shold I make long compte / thoost desloged\nand passe&dtail; byfore Murmyc&hbar;.  And thanne the Duc\nOde yssued out of the toun with a fayre companye of\npeuple, and came and presented hym self and al his\npeple tofore the kinge of Anssay, Anthony / and his\nbro\u00feer, whiche Joyously receyued them / and thus\nmarched thoost forth in fayre aray and good ordynaunce\nby the space of six dayes.  And now seaceth thistorye\nto speke of them, and speketh of the kin&gtee; Federyke\nand of the siege. / Here sheweth thistorye how the puyssaunce of\nZelodyus, kyng of Craco, was ryght grete / and\nthe king Federyk durst not goodly haue yssued / but\nalwayes he scarmousshed ofte with his enemys / and\nalmost dayly was at the barrers / the medlee was grete\n& stronge / and there were within the toune about\na houndred helmets of Hongery, that were valyaunt\nknightes & good men of werre / the whiche yssued / ofte & dide grete dommage to the sarasyns.  It happed\non a mornyng erly that the paynemes gaf a grete sawte\nto the toun / and the king Federyke with his peuple\nyssued out vnto the barrers / and there the\nscarmysshing bygan grete & morta&llbar; / and so manfully faught\nthe kyn&gtee;, that with the help of his men he gretly\ndommaged his enemyes / and made them to cesse of the\nsawte / & made them to goo back vnto theire\nlodgys.  And that tyme was the kyn&gtee; of Craco mounted vpon a\ngrete hors, his banere to the wyn&dtail; acompanyed with\nxv M l sarasyns, and came in fayre ordynaunce to the\nbatay&llbar;.  There was many stroke gyuen & receyued /\nand by force of armes the kynge & his peple was\nconstrayned to withdrawe hym back vnto the\nbarrers.  There was grete occysyon made, For horryble strokes\nwere gyuen of bothe sydes, and the king Federyke\nrecomforted wel his peple, For he dide grete faytte of\narmes of his owne handes.  And whan he perceyue&dtail; kyng Zelodyus that sore dommaged his peple, he\nsporyd his horse and toke his swer&dtail; in his fyst / an&dtail;\nrane smyttyng on the lyft syde and on the ryght syde\nvpon his enemyes tyl he made place, and came &\nsmote Zelodius vpon his helmet, by suche strengthe &\nvertue that he made hym to enclyne vpon his hors neck\nal astonyed / and lytel faylled that he was not\nouerthrawen to the erthe, For he lost bothe the steropes /\nbut soone he was socoured of his men whiche redrece&dtail;\nhym vp ryght / and the king Federyk adrece&dtail; hys\nswer&dtail; vpon a payneme, & suche a stroke he gaf hym\nthat he slew hym therwith.  The kin&gtee; of Craco was\nthenne redreced as said is / and he perceyuyng the kyng\nFederyk / that hewed legges & armes, & caste&dtail; to\ntherthe al that he recountre&dtail; of the sarasyns / had\ngrete anger in his herte and came nygh at hym / and\nwith an archegaye or dart launched at hym, by suche\nstrengthe that the dart entred so depe into hys body that the he&dtail; of it was sene at the back syde of\nhym.  That doon the kynge Federyk that felt the dystresse of\ndeth myght no more hold hym self up ryght, but fe&llbar;\n& reuersed dee&dtail; fro his hors to the ground.  Thenne\nwas his peple fu&llbar; heuy and dolaunt, and withdrew\nthem self anoone, and reentred into the toune & shetted\nthe gates after them.  And thenne byganne the sorowe\nto be grete in the town al about. /", "31": "Cap. XXXI. How the kinge of Craco dide do take the body of kynge Federyke that he had slayn and commanded it to be brent. The king of Craco thenne glad & joyous for cause of\nkyn&gtee; Federykes deth, commanded the corps to be\nbrought byfore the gate, & there to be brent for to haue\nabasshed the more \u00feem of the Cite, seyng theyre king\nin a fyre.  Whan the Cyteseyns & commynalte of\npraghe knew the deth of theire kynge / and the grete\ntyrannye of Z[el]odyus, they made grete sorowe / but in\nespescial the pucelle Eglantyne, his doughtir, was\nsorowfu&llbar; in herte, and so pyteously bewaylled and lamented,\nthat grete pyte it was to here & see / sayeng suc&hbar; or\nsemblable wordes: 'Ha / god! who might comforte me\nwhan I see my faders deth byfore me, & the total\ndyscomfyture of hys peple, & also the destruction of my\nself, For I see no way wherby myght come ony socoure\nvnto me, For I haue herd say that myn vncle, the\nkynge of Anssay, on whome I trusted more than to\na&llbar; other men in the worl&dtail;, hath be dyscomfyted\ntofore Lucembourgh.  Ha, veray god! creatour of\nCreatures, I ne wote other reffuge for me for to escape the\ntyraunt Z[el]odyus handes than the mercyfu&llbar; bosom\nof your grace to hy&dtail; me therin.  O ryght noble, ryght\npuyssaunt, & ryght excellent pryncesse! virgyne &\nmoder of god! Marye, my lady & maistresse / haue compassion on me! poure orphenyn &\nfaderles.'  Certaynly the pucelle Eglantyne bewayled, syghed, &\ncomplayned so piteously that no personne behel&dtail; her /\nbut they were of pyte constrayned to wepe how har&dtail;\nthat theire hertes had be, For in her anguysshe &\nsorowe she made none ende, but euer she wept &\nrendred teeris habundauntly.  Thenne the commynaltee\nof the toune, sore agast and timerous, were in propos\n& wylle for to yel&dtail; the toun & themself ouer to the\nkyng Z[el]odyus, \u00feat made them to be requyred &\nadmounested therof / shewing to them how they myght\nnot long endure nor withstan&dtail; ayenst his grete\npuyssaunce / & that theire Cate&llbar; & goodes shuld be saued\nto them / but yf he toke theire Cyte byforce, he shuld\nmake \u00feem bothe theire wyues & children to be brent\nal to asshis, as theire kynge was.  Wherfore the cyte\nhenge in balaunce to be delyuered & gyuen ouer to the\nSarasyns.  But emonge other were there two good\nmen, true & auncyent knightes, that said in this\nmanere: 'False peuple, what wyl you now doo, yet is\nnot the messager come agayn that rode toward the\nkin&gtee; of Anssay for socour, take courage & comfort\nyour self, For within short space of tyme ye shal here\ngood tydynges / thinke that ye be Cristen / & that\nCriste sha&llbar; helpe vs or it be lon&gtee;.'  And whan they\nher&dtail; hym so speke they were a&llbar; recomforted, &\nansuer&dtail; to the paynemes ambaxatours that they shul&dtail;\nneuer yel&dtail; them ouer vnto the last mans lyf of a&llbar;\nthem.  And whan the kynge Zelodyus knewe theire\nwyll, he was woo&dtail; angry & sorowful, & sware his\ngoddes that he shuld putte al on fyre. / The kynge Zelodyus was mouyd to yre & grete\nanger for thansuere of the commynalte of Prag&hbar;,\nwherfor he scarmysshed them sore, & gaf grete sawtes\nto theire Cite, but the noble and valyaunt men that were within deffended it strongly.  I wyl now retourne\nto speke of the Duc anthony and of hys brother\nRegnauld, of the kynge of Anssay / and also of Ode, Duc\nof Bauyere, whiche conduyted theyre oost, & marched\nfourth hastly, For they had tydinges of the myserye\nthat they of the Cite were in / but nothing they knew\nof the deth of kin&gtee; Federyke.  And on a thursday at\neuen, they lodged themself nygh to a grete ryuere, a\nleghe & a half fro the Cite of Praghe / and that same\neuen was a knight of that same Countree that was in\ntheire felawship commanded that on the morne he\nshuld anounce theire commyng to them of the Cite /\nand he on the morne erly mounted on hys hors, and\ntoke his way toward the Cite / and after a grete sawte\nwas seace&dtail; for fawte of daylight, he cam vnto a lytel\nposterne / and they of the garde there knew hym anone,\nand lete hym entre the toun / and as soone as he was\nentred he rode softly alon&gtee; by the gardes, cryeng alowde\nin this manyere: 'Lordes, deffende you wel, For here\ncommeth the floure of knighthode to your socours &\nhelpe with the kinge of Anssay, & anoone ye shal see\nthem bygynne the bataylle / and be a goo&dtail; chere, For\non my hed not one Sarasyn sha&llbar; escape, but he be\ndee&dtail; or take.'  And whan they vnderstode hym, they\nbygane to make such a Cry, & so lowde, that it was\nwonder to here sayeng: 'Lawde & thankin&gtee; be to god\nalmighty \u00feerof.'  And thenne they employed them self,\n& defended so valiauntly, that no sarasyn durst no\nlenger abyde nygh the wa&llbar; a bowe shotte / & many\npaynemes were thenne slayne, in so moche that the\ndyches watre was as tourned & dyed with theyre\nblood.  And whan Zelodyus sawe the grete & courageous\ndeffense of them of the toune he was abasshe&dtail;, &\nmeruaylled moche of theire joyful contenaunce. / Thenne whan Zelodyus perceyued that his folke\nwithdrewe them self thus backward, he was sorowfu&llbar; & dolaunt, & had grete merueylle, why &\nwherfore they of the toun were of so corageous deffense\nmore then in other sawtes tofore gyuen / but soone\nafter hys doleur & sorowe encrece&dtail; moc&hbar; more, For\nanthony approuched in fayre aray.  He, & Regnald\nhys brother, conduyted the first batay&llbar; and the kyn&gtee;\nof Anssay, & his Cousin the duc of Bauyere, led&dtail; the\naryer garde.  There had ye seen fayre companye of\ngentilmen in good aray / the baners & standarts\ndysployed / helmets & salades wel garnysshed with fyn\ngold & syluer, whic&hbar; resplendysshed fu&llbar; clere / And so\nthey cam & sawe the Cite that the paynemes assaylled,\n& gaaf grete sawte / & sawe theire tentes & pauyllons,\nwhere were grete nombre of sarasyns.  Thenne made\nAnthony his folk to tary and be styl a while, tyl the\naryergarde were nygh to them / and ordeyne&dtail; archers\n& crosbowes to be vnder the wynges of hys\nbatay&llbar;. and thenne they were apperceyue&dtail;, and seen of the\npaynemes, whic&hbar; went & made knowlege therof to\ntheire kyn&gtee;, sayen&gtee; in this manyere: 'Sire, leue the\nsawte, that in an euyl heure was bygonne / wete it that\nsuch a multitude of Cristen peple be commyn&gtee;\nhitherwar&dtail; that a&llbar; the feldes be couere&dtail; with.'  Whan\nZelodyus vnderstode these tydynges he was woo&dtail;\nwroth, & gretly abasshe&dtail;, and lefte the sawte, and\nmade the trompettes to sowne the retrayte, & that\neuery man shuld assemble togidre vnder hys\nbanere. he thenne ordeyned his bataylles as he coude\nbest.  And Anthony commanded hys trompettes to be sowned\nfor to bygynne the batay&llbar; / and they approched the\npaynemes, kepin&gtee; good ordynaunce.

Wel assayed the poyteuyns\nthem self, & dyde grete faytte of armes vpon theire\nenemyes.  But the kin&gtee; Zelodyus putte his shel&dtail;\ntofore his brest, & held his spere alowe, and broched\nhis hors with the sporys, & rane vpon the Crysten;\nand aftir hym folowed xv M&lbar; paynemes.  Zelodius\ndide there grete meruey&llbar;e of armes, and ouerthrew\nmany a Cristen to therthe, & gretly dommaged\nthem.  For his folke that folowed at back syde of hym faught\nmeruayllously.  Thenne cryed the kyn&gtee; Zelodius his\nbaner: 'Lordes, barons, auaunce, the journey is oure,\nFor they may not vs escape' / And they of poytou\nreceyued them moc&hbar; hardyfly, and wete it wel that\nthere was grete losse of peple of bothe\npartyes.  Thenne came duc Anthony with the swer&dtail; in his\nfyst / and whan he perceyued his peple recule a lytel,\nnyg&hbar; he deyed for sorowe / and cryed: 'Lusynen!'\nwith a high voys, and putte hym emon&gtee; the sarasyns\nmore hastyfully than thundre falleth fro heuen, and\nfaught & smote on eche syde vpon his enemyes, and\nouerthrew a&llbar; them that he recountre&dtail;. and his peuple\nfolowed at back syde of hym that were al wondred of\nhis grete fayttes & valyauntnes, For there ne was so\nhardy a sarasyn \u00feat durst hym abyde / but fledd &\nreculed vnto theire tentes.  And this seyn&gtee; the kin&gtee;\nZelodius, he cryed: 'auaunt, lordes & barons, and\ndeffen&dtail; you / how is that for one man alone that ye\nflee / it is to you grete shame.'  And aftir these wordes\nhe retourned, & assembled his peple ayen togidre, and\ngaaf grete batayl mortal vnto anthony & the\npoytevyns.  Thenne came thadmyral with ten thousan&dtail; fighting\nmen / and thenne enforced the batay&llbar; ryght horryble,\nFor there were many of the sarasyns slayn and sore\nhurt.", "32": "Cap. XXXII.

And she that wel knewe he said trouth,\nansuer&dtail; to hym in this manere: 'Dere vncle, doo\ntherof al your playsyre.'  Thenne came the kynge in to\nthe grete halle where the two brethern were, & the baronye with them, and said to Anthony in this\nmanyere: 'noble Duc, vouchesaf to understan&dtail; my\nwordes, the barons of this lan&dtail; that be here present,\nbesec&hbar; your good grace / & as touching my self, I\nhertyly praye you that it plese you, that Regnauld your\nbrother be kin&gtee; of this royalme, and that he take\nEglantyne my Cousyn to his lady / prayen&gtee; hym that\nhe this wyl not reffuse, For the barons of the lan&dtail;\ndesire hym moche to be theire lord.'

Thenne ansuered Eglantyne, & said / 'Ha /\nnoble lord, your valyaunt body is derer to me & bettre\nworth than ten other suche royames as myn is / &\nmore it is to be preysed.'  Of theire wordes I wyl\nseace / but that nyght was begoten of them a noble\nsone that was named Olyphart / he made in tyme\nafterward grete faytte of armes, and subdued & gate al the\nlow marche of hollan&dtail; & Zelan&dtail;, Vtreyght, & the\nRoyame of Danemarche / and al the partyes of\nNorthweghe also.  On the morne the day was fayre &\nclere.  Thenne was the noble lady Eglantyne ledd to here the\nmasse / and al the baronye, ladyes & damoyselles,\nacompanyed her thitherward.  And after the mass was doo,\nthey retourned to the ryche pauyllon / and as they were\nredy to sette \u00feem at dyner / came there two knightis\nfro Lucembourgh, that brought lettres to Duc Anthony\nfrom the Duches Crystyne his wyf / the whiche after\ntheire obeyssaunce honourably made, said to hym in\nthis wise: 'My lord, ye oughte to take grete joye /\nFor my lady the Duches is brought to bed of the most\nfayrest sone that euer was seen in no lan&dtail;.'  'Now,\nfayre lordes,' said anthony, 'blessid be god therof / and\nye be right welcome to me' / & syn toke the lettres. Thistorye sayth that anthony, Duc of\nLucembourgh, was joyful & glad of these tydynges,\nand so was his brother Regnaul&dtail;.

There the Duc Ode\nfestyed them right honourably the space of thre dayes /\nand on the foureth day they departed & toke theire\nleue of the Duc Ode / and rode so lon&gtee; tyl they came a day journey nygh to Coloyne.  And there the\nfoure knightes that conduyted the Coloyners auaunced\nthem self byfore Duc Anthony, & to him said in this\nmanere: 'My lord, it is best that we hast vs byfore\nyou toward the toun, to apparay&llbar; & make al thin&gtee;\nredy for your passage.'  'By my feyth,' said the Duc\nAnthonye, 'that playseth me wel.'  Thenne departed\nthe foure knightes & theire men with them, & rode\ntyl they came to the Cite of Coloyne, where they were\nreceyued with Joye / and the Cytezeyns & gouernours\nof the cyte demanded of them how they had exployted\nin theire vyage / And they recounted to them a&llbar; the\ntrouth of the fayte and the valyauntnes & noble prowes\nof the two brethern / & how regnauld was made kyng\n[of] Behayne.  And whan they of Coloyne understode\nthem they were ryght glad & joyous, sayeng they were wel happy & ewrous to haue acquyred the loue\n& good wy&llbar; of two lordes of so grete valeur.  And\nthenne they made grete apparay&llbar; for to receyue the\nDuc Anthony, and the kin&gtee; of Anssay with theire\nbaronye.  Soo lon&gtee; rode thoost that they came to\nColoyne, where the Cytezeyns cam & mete hem\nhonourably / and to the prynces they made grete reuerence,\nprayeng them that they wold be lodged that nyght\nwithin the toun, where they were nobly festyed &\nhonourably seruyd at souper.  And on the morn\nAnthony & his oost passed ouer the Ryn, and toke his\nleue of them of Coloyne, whiche he thanked moche,\nsayeng: 'yf they were in ony wyse oppressed by theire\nenemyes he wol&dtail; be euer redy for tayde & socoure them\nafter hys power.'  Wherof they thanked hym\nmoche.  Thenne the Duc Anthony & the king of Anssay dyde\nso moche by theire journeys, that on an euen they\ncame & lodged them in the medow nyg&hbar; by\nLucembourgh. / The duchesse Cristyne was replenysshed with joye,\nwhan she knew the commyng of her lord anthony /\nand immedyatly she, nobly acompanyed, yssued out of\nthe toun / and a&llbar; the noble cyteseyns folowed her to\nmete with theire lord, the whiche they recountred a\nhalf a myle fro the toun.  What shal I say / greter\njoye was neuer sene than that was made for the retourne\nof Duc Anthony.  The Duchesse made humbly her\nobeyssaunce vnto hym / and hertyly welcommed\nhym.  The peuple cryed on hye for Joye, sayeng thus:\n'welcomme our lord ryght redoubted.'  The joye was\ngrete thrugh the toun where the Duc festyed the kynge\nof Anssay by the space of six dayes contynuelly, &\nforgaf & rendred to hym a&llbar; his obligacions, and hel&dtail; hym\nquytte / except the Foundacion of the pryore, where as\nsowles shuld be prayed for / for the loue of Regnault his brother.  And the kinge of Anssay thanked hym\nmoche, & toke his leue of hym / departed, & came in\nAnssay, where as he was receyued with joye / And the\nDuc anthony abode with the Duchesse Cristyne, on\nwhom he gate a sone that same yere which was clepid\nLocher, whiche afterward delyuered the Countrey of\nArdane fro thevys, murdrers, & robbeurs; and in the\nwodes there he founded an abbeye, and endowed it\nwith grete pocessyons / And he also dyde doo make\nthe bridge of Masyeres vpon the ryuere of Meuze, and\nmany other fortresses in the basse marche of hollan&dtail; /\nand dyde many fayre fayttes of armes with the kin&gtee;\nOlyphart of behayne, that was his Cousyn, & sone to\nkyn&gtee; Regnauld.  It happed not long after the kynge\nof Anssay was retourned in to his royame, that warre\nmeuyd betwix hym & the Duc of austeryche & the\n[Erle] of Fyerbourgh. wherfor he besought the Duc\nAnthony for socour, that gladly obtempered to his\nrequeste, in so moche that he toke by force of armes\nthe Erle of Fyerbourgh / and syn pas- sed in Austeryche,\nwhere he dyscomfyted the Duc in batay&llbar;, and made\nhym to be pacyfyed with the kynge of Anssay, to the\ngrete prouffyt & honour of the kinge.  And bertrand\ntheldest sone of the Duc Anthony, was assured with\nMelydee the sayd kin&gtee; of Anssays doughter / the\nwhiche Bertrand afterward was kynge of anssay, and\nhys brother Locher was Duc of Lucembourgh, after\nthe decesse of the Duc Anthony hys fader.  But of\nthis matere I wyl no more speke at this tyme / but shal\nretourne to speke of Melusyne & of Raymondyn, and\nof theire other children. / Now sayth thystorye, that Raymondyn by hys\nnoblenes & grete vasselage conquer&dtail; grete\ncountrees / and to hym many barons dyde homage vnto the\nland of Brytayne.  And Melusyne had two yere after\nthat two sones, the first was named Froymond, that entierly louyd holy Chirc&hbar;, and that was wel shewed in\nhis ende, For he was professi&dtail; monke in to thabbeye\nof Maillezes, wherof there befe&llbar; a grete & an horryble\nmyschief, as ye shal here herafter by thystorye / and\nthe other child that they had the yere folowyn&gtee; was\nnamed Theodoryk, the whiche was ryght\nbatayllous.  Here I shal leue to speke of the two children / and I\nshal shewe you of Geffray with the grete tot&hbar;, that\nwas yrous & hardy / & most enterpryse dide of a&llbar; hys\nbretheren.  And wete it wel that the said geffray\ndoubted neuer man / And thystorye sheweth, & the\ntrue Cronykle that he faught ayenst a knight, that was\ngendred with a spyryte in a medowe nygh by Lusynen,\nas ye shal here herafter.  It is trouth that thenne\nGeffray was grete & ouergrowen / and herde tydynges\nthat there was in Garande peple that wold not obey to\nhys fader / thenne sware Geffray by the good lord\nthat he shul&dtail; make them to come as reason requyreth,\nand to do that he toke leue of hys fader, that was right\nwroth of hys departyng / and had with hym to the\nnombre of fyue houndred men of armes, and a houndred\nbalesters, and so went in to Garande / and anoone\nenquyred after them that were dysobedyent / and they\nthat held the party of Raymondyn shewed hym the\nFortresse where they were, & armed them to goo with\nhym to helpe to dystroye hys enemyes.  'By my feyth,\nfayre lordes,' sayd Geffray with the grete toeth / 'ye\nare ryght true & loyal peuple / & I thanke you of\nthonour that ye proffre me / but as for this tyme\npresent I shall not nede you, For I haue men of armes\nynough for taccomplyss&hbar; myn enterpryse.'  'For soothe,\nsire, ye haue more to doo than ye suppose, For your\nenemyes ben ryght strong & of meruayllous courage, &\nthey be frendes & cousyns, and of the grete & moost\nnoble bloo&dtail; of al the Countree.'  'Fayre sires,' said\nGeffray, 'doubte you not, For thrughe thayde of god omnipotent I shal the matere wel redresse.  And wete\nit wel there shal be none so myghty / but I shal make\nthem to obeye my commandement or to deye of an euyl\ndeth.  And also, fayre lordes & true frendes, yf I nede\nyou I sha&llbar; sen&dtail; for you' / And they ansuer&dtail;, 'we are\nnow al redy, and also shal we be at al tymes that it\nplayse you vs to calle.'  'Fayre lordes,' said Geffray with\nthe grete toth / 'that ought to be thanked for.'  Thenne\ntoke Geffray hys leue of them / and went forth on his\nway toward a Fortresse that was called Syon / & within\nthe same was one of the enemyes of geffray that hight\nClaude of Syon, & were thre bretheren.  Moche were\nthe thre brethern yrous & proude / and wol&dtail; haue\nsubdued and putte vnder theire subjection a&llbar; theire\nneyghbours.  Thenne sent geffray with the grete toeth wordes\nof deffyaunce / outhre to come & make theire\nobeyssaunce to hym for Raymondin his faders.  And they\nansuer&dtail; to the messager, 'that for Raymondyn ner for\nno man on his byhalf they shuld nought doo / and that\nhe shuld no more retourne to them for this matere, for\nthan he were a fole.'  'By my feyth,' said the\nmessager, 'I shal kepe me wel therfro / but that I bryn&gtee;\nwith me a maister in medecyne, that shal make suche\na lectuary or drynk wherof ye shal be poysonne&dtail;, &\nsyn hanged by the neck.'  And of these wordes were\nthe iij bretheren wood wroth.  And wete it wel that\nyf the messager had not hasted his hors away he had\nbe take & deed without ony remedye, For they were\nfu&llbar; yrous & crue&llbar;, and doubted not god nor no man\nlyuyn&gtee;.  Thenne retourned the messager towar&dtail; geffray\nand recounted hym  the grete pryde & auauntyng of the\nbretheren.  'By my heed,' said Geffray with the grete\ntoeth, 'a lytel rayne leyeth doun grete wyn&dtail; / & doubte\nyou not but I shal pay them wel theire wages.' Thystorye sayth, that whan geffray vnderstode the\ngrete pryde & the fel ansuere of the thre brethern, without ony moo wordes he came & lodged hym &\nhis peuple half a leghe fro the said Fortresse.  Thenne\ntoke he his armures & armed hym of al pieces; toke\nwith hym a squyer that wel knew the Countrey /\nmounted on horsback / commanded his men that they\nshuld not meue them thens vnto tyme they had wor&dtail;\nof hym, & departed with hys esquyer / but there was a\nknyght that wel knew hys noble & fyers courage, &\nthat he doubted nothin&gtee; of the world / whic&hbar; toke\nx.  men of armes with hym and went after Geffray,\nfolowyn&gtee; hym fro ferre, For he moche loued geffray.  Geffray\nrode so lon&gtee; that he sawe the Fortresse of Syon vpon\na hye roche.  'By my feyth,' said thenne geffray, 'yf\nthe Fortresse be so strong at that other syde as it is at\nthis syde, hit shal gyue me moche peyne or euer it be\ntake, I must see & know yf it be also stron&gtee; at that\nother parte.'  Thenne he & his esquyer aduyronned\nthe Fortresse about, al alon&gtee; by a lytel wo&dtail;, that they\nmight not be aspyed ne sene.  They came &\ndescended in a valey / and euer the forsaid knyght that\nwas named Philibert folowed hym a ferre / and so long\nrode geffray tyl he had ouer sene the said fortres al\nroun&dtail; about / and hym semed wel that it might be\ntake by the brydge syde, For it was the feblest syde of\nit / Thenne entred geffray & hys esquyer in a lytel\npath, & retourned vpon the mountayne towar&dtail; hys\nlodgis, where his peple were hym abydyn&gtee;.  Philebert,\nthat sawe Geffray retourne, thought he woul&dtail; lete hym\npasse tofore hym, Wherfor he and his felawship reculed\nwithin the wode, to thende thay shuld not be perceyued\nof hym / but soone after they sawe a companye of men\nof warre comynge that same way that geffray came\ntowar&dtail; the Fortresse, and were to the nombre of xiiii\npersonne wel armed.  Wherfore the said knight\nphilibert was abasshed & agast, lest they shuld mete with geffray, For wel he wyst that geffray wol&dtail; fyght with\nthem / as he dide / and that shal ye here herafter./ In this partye, sayth thistorye, that vpon the topp of\nthe mountayne geffray recountred the said\ncompanye, And who that shul&dtail; enquere of me what folke\nthey were; I shuld say it was one of Claude of Syon\nbretheren that came toward his brother at his\nmandement.  And wete it wel, that the way was there so\nnarow that vnnethe one hors myght passe by\nother.  And whan Geffray with the grete toeth recountred\nthem, he sayd to hym that rode first of alle that he\nshuld tary and make his company to stand asyde tyl\nhe were passed the mountayne.  'By my feyth,' said\nhe \u00feat was proude & orgueyllous, 'Sire daw fole, wel\nwe muste first knowe what ye be, that say that we\nretourne vs for you.'  'By god,' said Geffray with the\ngrete toth / 'that shal you knowe anone, For I shal\nmake you retourne ayenst your wy&llbar;.  I am Geffray\nof Lusynen / tourne back / or elles I shal make you to\nretourne by force.'  Whan Guyon the brother of Claude\nof Syon vnderstode hym & knew that it was geffray\nwith the grete toeth / he cryed to his folk, 'auaunt,\nlordes barons, For yf he escape grete shame shal be to\nvs / in an euyl heure is he come in to oure land for to\ndemande seruytude of vs.'  Thenne whan geffray\nvnderstode these wordes he drew out his swor&dtail; & smote\nthe nethermost of alle vpon his he&dtail;, so grete a stroke\nthat he ouerthrew hym a&llbar; astonyed doune to the\nerthe, and syn passed forth by hys hors, & ouer hym\nthat laye alon&gtee; the way, in suche wyse that he al to\nbrusid the body of hym / And thenne geffray atteyned\nanother in the brest foynyng with hys swer&dtail;, so that\nhe fe&llbar; doune deed to therthe / and syn cryed aftir\nthe o\u00feer, 'False traytours, ye may not escape, ye shal\nretourne to your euyl helthe.'  Thenne he passed fourth to the iii de , whic&hbar; was grete & stron&gtee;, & smote Geffray\nvpon the helmet with al his strengthe / but the helmet\nwas har&dtail; and \u00fee swer&dtail; glenced asyde & dommaged\nhym nought / but Geffray toke his swer&dtail; with two\nhandes and smote hym vpon the coyffe of stele vnto\nthe brayne, & reuersed hym deed to the ert&hbar;.  And\nwhan guyon perceyued this myschief he was wode\nwroth & fu&llbar; of yre, For he might not come to geffray,\nwherfore he commanded euery man to retourne, that\nthey might haue them self at large to deffende eche\nother.  Thenne euery man tourned back & fledd, &\nyssued out of that narrow way in to a playn fel&dtail;, And\ngeffray with the grete toth pursiewed them, the swer&dtail;\nin his han&dtail;.  Now sha&llbar; I speke of the knight\nphilibert, whiche was approched nygh the sai&dtail; way, and\nherde the noyse / so he calle&dtail; to hym his\nfelawes.  And thenne guyon and his men were in \u00fee playn &\nassaylled geffray on al sydes of hym / but as preu &\nvalyaunt he deffended vygourously his flesshe / and\nalso hys esquyer bare hym valyauntly / and was ryght\nstrong the batay&llbar;.  Now most I speke of hym whic&hbar;\ngeffray first ouerthrew to therthe in the pat&hbar; forsai&dtail;,\nFor whan he perceyued that guyon was retourned by\nthe force of geffray / and sawe his two felawes lyeng\ndeed by hym, he was moche dolaunt, and behel&dtail; all\nabout hym & fon&dtail; his hors, wher on he with grete\npeyne mounted, for he was al to brusyd in hys body, &\nhasted hym as he coude best toward Syon.  And whan\nhe came to the fortresse he fon&dtail; Claude at yate and\nsome of his men with hym / the whiche perceyued\nthat he that was commyng toward hym was al bloody\nand knew hym wel / & of hym demanded who so had\narayed hym / And he recounted thadventure how they\nhad recountre&dtail; geffray, and how he adommaged them\nand had made guyon hys brother to retourne fro the\nnarow lane by force, & that yet lasted theyre bataylle. Thenne whan Claude vnderstode hym he was sorowfu&llbar;\n& angry, and yede and armed hym, and made his men\nto be arme&dtail;. Moche dolaunt was Claude whan he vndersto&dtail; of\nthe vylonnye & dommage that geffroy had don\nto Guyon his brother / and how yet they were fyghtyng\ntogidre / & armed of al pieces.  his men with hym rode\nthitherward / and were in nombre thre score\nbassynets.  But for nought he toke hys waye, For philibert with\nhis ten knyghtes were come to the batay&llbar;, & faught in\nsuche wyse that al guyons meyne were slayne & he\ntake / and soone sware Geffray that he shuld make\nhym to be hanged by the neck.  Thenne came the said\nesquyer, whiche was retourned in to the forsay&dtail; land,\nto fette a fayre swer&dtail;, that he tofore sawe fa&llbar; fro one\nof Guyons men / & said to Geffray in this manyere,\n'My lord, I haue her&dtail; grete bruyt of men armed\ncommyn&gtee; hitherwar&dtail;.'  And whan Geffray vnderstode\nhym he fourthwith made Guyon to be boun&dtail; at a tree\nwithin the wo&dtail; nygh by them, & syn retourned with\nhys men toward the said path or lane for to abyde\nthere his auenture.  And philibert rode vnto the top\nof the hy&llbar;, and perceyue&dtail; Claude & hys felawship\nthat entred the lane / thanne he retourned to his\nfelawes & sayd to Geffray, 'Sire, the best that ye can\ndoo is to kepe wel this pathe, here c&omacr;me your\nenemyes.'  And Geffray with the gret toeth ansuer&dtail; /\n'doubte you not / but it shal be wel kept &\ndeffended.'  Thenne he called to hym the squyer that was come\nwith hym, & sai&dtail;: 'renne hastily towar&dtail; thoost, &\nmake my folke to c&omacr;me hither.\"  And he anone\ndeparted toward thoost, and whan he was there arryued\nhe said to \u00feem, 'Fayre lordes, now lightly on horsback,\nFor geffray fyghteth ayenst his enemyes.'  And they\narmed them & soone mounted on theire horses, and\nhasted them to folowe the squyer that guyded them the nerest way there he supposed to fyn&dtail; Geffray,\nfightin&gtee; with his\nenmyes. Thystorye sayth that geffray, philibert, & theire\nknightes were at thentree of the pathe / and\nthenne came Claude & his men with grete puyssaunce\nalon&gtee; thrugh the lane, & wel they supposed to haue\nmounted the montayne.  But Geffray was at thentre\nof the pat&hbar; that vygourously & valyauntly deffended\nthe passage / and wete it wel there was none so hardy\nbut he made hym to recule.  For there were two of\nhis knightes that descended fro theire horses, & stode\nat eyther syde of geffray, & proudly rebuckyd Claudes\nmen with theire speres, & many of them were there\nslayne.  Philibert was thenne descended from his\nhors, and thre othre of his companye, and recouered\nthe montayne aboue the pathe, where as they gadred\nstones and threw them vpon them that were in the\nlane, thrugh suche yre & grete strengt&hbar;, that there was\nnone so stron&gtee; bassynets nor armure but it was perce&dtail;;\nand therwith they were astonye&dtail; or elles ouerthrawen /\nand wete it wel \u00feat there were more than\nxx ti .  slayn.  Thenne c&amacr;me there the squyer with the batay&llbar; that\nhe brought.  And whan geffray knew it, he\ncommanded thre houndred men of armes, that they shul&dtail;\ndraw at the other ende of the lane to kepe the passage,\nthat Claude nor hys peple should not retourne to theire\nfortresse.  And anone from thens the squyer with his\ncompanye departed, & came hastly to fore the medowe,\n& passed byfore the Fortresse.  And whan Clerevaul&dtail;,\nthe iii de brother of Claude, sawe them, he demed that it\nwas some socours that came to them / For he trowed\nnot that in the lan&dtail; shuld haue be so many\nenemyes.  The whiche esquyer with his companye came with\namyable contenaunce, shewyng no semblaunt but as\nfrendes.  And thenne Clerevauld, that byleued wel that they\nwere theyre frendes lete fa&llbar; the bridge, & opened the yate where he stode with xx ti . men of armes.  And\nwhan the squyer & his companye perceyued \u00feat the\nbridge was doun & the gate open, they drew them\nhastly in the way to passe the Fortres.  And passyn&gtee;\nby the Fortresse, Clervauld demanded what they were /\nand they ansuer&dtail;: 'We be frendes.' and in\napprouching of the sai&dtail; bridge to the nombre xx ti knightes, they\nenquyred after Claude of Syon: 'For fayn we wol&dtail;\nspeke with hym.'  And Clereuauld them approuched,\nsayen&gtee;: 'he shal retourne anoone, For he is departed to\nfyght with Geffray with the grete toeth our enemye,\nthat he & Guyon our brother haue enclosed in yonder\nmountayne that is there byfore you / and wete it wel\nthat Geffray may not escape them, though he were\ntempred with fyne stele, but that he shal be slayne\nor take.'  'By my feyth,' sayd the squyer, 'this be\ngood tydynges.'  An thenne he approuched with his\nxx ti knightes nerer & nerer, askyng hym where shal\nwe goo to helpe hym.  'By my feyth,' sayd\nClereuauld, 'gramercys it shal not nede at this\ntyme.' Thystorye sheweth that the squyer approched to\nClereuauld so nygh by his fayre wordes, that he\n& hys company came vpon the bridge / & thenne he\ncryed to hys peple / 'auaunt, lordes, the fortresse is\noure.'  And whan Clereuauld her&dtail; these wordes, he\nsuppose&dtail; to haue reculed & to haue lyft vp the bridge /\nbut the squyer & his peuple came so rudly that it\nwas not in theire powere to haunce the bridge / but\nbare it doune by force, and anone alighted & entred in\nat the gate / and with two speres vndersette the\nportecollys / & immedyatly descended more than an\nhoundred of the squyers men on foot, & came & entred into\nthe Fortres.  Thenne was clereuaul&dtail; take, and al hys\npeple that were there with hym, & brought vnto a\nchambre fast bounden, where they were surely kept\nwith fourty men of armes / And after this don, they assembled them, & toke Counsey&llbar; how they might\nbest send wor&dtail; vnto geffray of this faytte, & how they\nshuld kepe them within the Fortresse to thentent to\ntake Claude yf it happed hym to retourne / And thenne\nsaid the squyer that he hym self shuld goo to gyue\nGeffray knowlege of this auenture.  And thenne anone\nhe departed and came to Geffray, to whom he shewed\na&llbar; the trouth of the faytte / and whan geffray knew\nthauenture he was joyful, & made hym knight, & gaaf\nhym the gouernaunce of a houndred men of armes / &\ncommanded that he shuld go anoone in to the countrey,\nto kepe wel that Claude shuld take none o\u00feer way, but\nthe way to the Fortresse; For yf he escaped he might\ndo grete harme tofore he were take, & that bettre it\nwere to close hym in that lane, & there by force to take\nhym.  'Sire,' said the new knight, 'doubte you not he\nshal not escape you, but yf he cane flee, yf that I may\ncome by tymes to the lane.'  Thenne he departed &\ndescended the mountayne with hys men of armes.  And\ngeffray taryed at the pathe, that mightily faught with\nhis swerde vpon his enemyes.  And wel fourty knyghtes\nwere alighted on foot vpon \u00fee hylle, & threw stones\nvpon Claude & his peple in suche wyse, that by force\nhe & hys peuple was constrayned to retourne / And\nGeffray & his peple entred in to the lane & chaced\n\u00feem / but vnnethe he might passe to pursiew men\nfor deed men that were slayn with castyn&gtee; of\nstones.  Now shal I shew you of the new knight that was\ncommyn&gtee; at the other lanes ende with his company / but\nwhan he her&dtail; the bruyt of the horses / he thought wel\nthat Claude retourned / and he toke the couert of the\nmountayne & suffred Claude to take the way toward\nthe Fortresse. Thystorye telleth that Claude hasted hym fast to\ncome out of the lane for to saue hym self &\nhis peple in the Fortresse of Syon, but that the fole thinketh oftymes commeth to foly.  It is veray trouth\nthat he spede hym so fast that he was out of the lane\n& came to his large / and so he ne taryed neyther for\none nor for other / but came walapyn&gtee; toward the\nFortresse.  And whan he was nygh, he cryed with a\nhigh voyce / 'open the gates' / & so they dide / and\nthenne he passed the bridge and entred, & was alyghted\nafore that he perceyued that he had lost the Fortresse /\nand fourthwith he was seasyd & bounde by hys\nenemyes.  Thenne was he gretly abasshed; For he sawe not about\nhym no man that he knew.  'What dyuel is this?\nwhere are my men become?'  'By my feyth,' said a\nknight / 'ryght foorth shal ye knowe, For ye shal lodge\nwith them' / And so immedyatly he was brought to\nthe chambre where Clereuauld, his brother & his peuple\nwere in pryson.  Thenne whan he perceyued them boun&dtail;\n& kept as they were, he was ryght dolaunt.  And whan\nClereuauld sawe hym, he said: 'Ha / a, Claude, fayre\nbrother, we are fa&llbar; by your pryde into grete captiuite /\nand doubte it not we shal neuer escape from hens\nwithout losse of our lyues, For to cruel is Geffray.'  And\nClaude ansuerd hym: 'We muste abyde a&llbar; that therof\nshal fa&llbar;.'  Thenne came Geffray ryght foort&hbar; to the\nFortresse, & had slayn or take a&llbar; the residu of Claudes\npeple / saaf hys brother Guyon whic&hbar; was brought\nwith hym, & putte prysonner in the said pryson where\nas Geffray entred / and emong al o\u00feer said to Claude:\n'How,' said he, 'thou fals traytour, durst thou be so\nhardy to hurte or dommage my faders Countre & his\npeuple, thou that owest to be his subget / and by the\nfeyth that I owe to my fader I shal punysshe the, in\nexemple of a&llbar; other, For I shal doo the han&gtee; byfore\nValbruyant, the Castel in syght of thy Cousyn Gueryn,\nthat is a traytour as thou art, vnto my lord my fader.'\nAnd whan Claude her&dtail; that gretyn&gtee;, wete it wel / he\nwas not therwith playsed.  But whan the peple of the Countrey knew that Syon the Fortresse, & Claude and\nhis brethern were take & theire peple slayne / thenne\ncame playntes of robberyes & other euyl caas vpon\nClaude & vpon his peuple, & within that same Fortresse\nwere founde more than a C prysonners of the good\npeple of the Countrey, as marchants & straungers that\nwere robbed passyng by the way / For tofore that tyme\nnone passed by the sai&dtail; Fortresse vnspoyle&dtail;.  And\nwhan geffray her&dtail; of this tydynges, he made to be\nsette vpon the syde of the hille a payre of galowes / &\ntherat dide do be hanged al the peple of Claude / and\nhis two brethern he spared for that tyme / and gaaf the\nCastel in keping vnto a knight of the Countrey that\nwas ryght valyaunt & wyse / & commanded hym vpon\nhis lyf to kepe it wel / and to gouerne lawfully his\nsubgets, & to kepe good justice / And he promysed\nhym so to doo, For he gouerned the countre wel &\nrightfully.  And after his commandement he departed\non the morowe toward Valbruyant / and toke the thre\nbretheren with hym, the whiche had grete fere of\ndeth / and that was not without cause / as ye shal here\nherafter. Thystory sayth that geffray & his peuple rode tyl\nthey cam tofore Valbruyant / wher as tentes were\ndressed & sett vp, and euery man lodged in\nordre.  Thenne made geffray ryght foorth to sette vp galowes\ntofore the Castel gate, and there dide do hang\nincontynent Claude & his two bretheren / and sent worde\nto them of the Castel / yf that they yelded not to hym\nthe Fortres, that he wold hang them yf he had it by\nforce.  And whan Gueryn of Valbruyant her&dtail; these\ntydynges, he sayd to his wyf: 'It is so for trouth,\nmadame, that ageynst this strong dyue&llbar; I ne may\nwithstan&dtail; ne kepe this Fortresse, wherfor I wyl departe &\ngoo vnto mountfrayn to Guerar&dtail; my nevew, & to other\nmy frendes for to haue Counsey&llbar; how we may haue traytye of pais with Geffray.'  And thenne the wyf\nthat was right sage & subtyl said to hym / 'go foorth /\nby the grace of god, & kepe you wel that ye be nat\ntake by the waye, and departe not from Mountfrayn\ntyl ye haue tydynges fro me, For by thayde of god I\nhoop that I shal purchasse a good traytye with geffray\nfor you;  For had ye don after my Counsey&llbar;, & byleued\nme, ye shuld not haue medled with the werkes of\nClaude & of his bretheren / not with standing yet haue\nye not falsed your feyth toward your liege lord\nRaymondyn of Lusynen.'  Thenne Gueryn her said: 'My\ndere sustir & spouse, doo that ye thinke best, For\nmy fyaunce is in you / and I wyl byleue a&llbar; that ye\nmay counseylle.'  And thenne departed he by a pryvy\nposterne vpon a swyft hors, and passed by the couerts\nof the wodes, so that he was not aspyed.  And whan\nhe was a lytel passed he sporyd his hors, and the hors\nbare hym swyftly, and wete it that he had so grete fere\nlest he shuld be aspyed, that he was almost out of his\nwyt / & thanked god moche whan he fon&dtail; thentre of\nthe Forest \u00feat dured wel two leghes / and toke the way\ntoward Mountfrayn, as moche as he coude ryde. Thystory testyfyeth, that so long rode Gueryn that\nhe came to mountfrayn, where he foun&dtail; guerard\nhys neuew, & recounted to hym al these werkes; and\nhow Geffray with the grete toth had take Claude\ntheire Cousyn & his two brethern, & brought tofore\nValbruyaunt, where he dide al thre to be hanged / and\nhow he was departed thens, doubtyng to be take\nwithin the Fortresse.  'By my feyth,' said Guerard, 'Fayre\nvncle, ye haue do wysely, For after that men speke of\nGeffray, he is a valyaunt knight of hye & puyssaunt\nenterpryse / and he is moche cruel & moche to be\ndoubted.  Woo is to me that euer we went to Claude!\nFor wel we knew that he & hys bretheren were of euyl\ngouernement, & that none passed foreby theire\nFortresse vnrobbed.  Now pray We god, that he\npreserueth bothe our lyues & honour in this affayre.  Fayre\nvncle, vpon this caas we muste seke remedy / It is good\nthat we lete haue knowledge to our parents & frendes\n\u00feerof, \u00feat haue be of this folyss&hbar; alyaunce.'  And\ngueryn ansuerd: 'that is trouth.'  Thenne they sent\nwordes to theyre frendes that they shuld al c&omacr;me to\nmountfrayn, so that they might haue Counsei&llbar; togidre\nvpon this faytte, & to seke the meane to escuse them\ntoward geffray.  Now resteth thystory of them / and\nspeketh of the lady of Valbruyant that was moche\nsubtyl & sage / and she euer blamed her lord of that he\nhad consented to Claude & to hys brethern.  This lady\nhad a doughter, whiche was of the age of ix yere / &\nfayre & gracyous; and also a sone that was ten yere of\nage, whiche was fayre & wel endoctryned.  And thenne\nthis lady as she had of nothin&gtee; be abasshed / mounted\nupon a palfray rychely arayed, & dide do be mounted\nher two children vpon two horses, and ordeyned two\nauncyent gentylmen to conduyte theire horses / and\nacompanyed with six damoyselles, dide open the gate\nwhere she fon&dtail; the new knight that brought the\nmandement of geffray, whic&hbar; she receyued benyngly,\nand he that coude moche of honour made to her the\nreuerence / and the lady seyd to hym temperatly: 'Sire\nknight, my lord is not within / and therfore I wyl go\nmyself toward my lord your maister to knowe what is\nhis playsyr, For it semeth me that he is come hither\nto make werre / but I byleue not that it is for my lord\nnor for none within this fortresse.  For god deffende\nthat my lord or ony of this place had do that thing\nthat shuld dysplayse geffray or my lord his fader / and\nby aduenture yf some of his synester frendes haue\ninformed geffray otherwyse than raison, I wold humbly\nbeseche & pray hym that he vouche sauf to here my said lord & husban&dtail; in his escuses & deffenses' / and\nthenne whan the knight herd her speke so sageously /\nher ansuerde: 'Madame, this requeste is raisonable,\nwherfore I shal conduyte you towar&dtail; my lord / and I\nhope that ye shal fyn&dtail; hym frendly, & that ye shal\nhaue a goo&dtail; traytye with hym / how be it, he is\ninfourmed of gueryn your lord ryght malycyously / but I\nbyleue that at your requeste he shal graunte a part of\nyour petycion' / And thenne they departed & c&amacr;me\ntoward the lodgys of Geffray. Thystorye sayth that whan geffray saw the\ncommyng of the lady he yssued out of his tente &\ncame ayenst her / and she that was wel nourrytured\nheld her two children tofore geffray, to whom she made\nhumble reuerence / and thenne geffray enclyned hym\nto her, & toke her vp right humbly, & said: 'Madame,\nye be right welcome' / and 'my lord,' said she, 'I\nsee \u00feat I desyre' / and thenne her two children dyde theyre obeyssaunce in the moost humble wyse / and\nhe gaf to them ayen his salut.  Thenne toke the lady\nthe wor&dtail; / and feynyng as though she had knowen\nnothing of hys euyl wy&llbar; / said vnto hym in this wyse:\n'My lord / my lord! myn husband as for this tyme he\nis not present in this Countre.  Wherfore I am come\ntoward you to pray you that it may playse you to take\nyour lodgys in your Fortresse, and take with you as\nmany of your peple as shal you playse; For, my lord,\nthanked be god, there is ynough to plese you with /\nand wete it wel that I & my meyne shal receyue you\ngladly, as we owe to doo the sone of our souerayn\nlor&dtail; natura&llbar;.'  Whan geffray vnderstode her requeste\nhe was gretly abasshed how she durst desyre hym /\nconsyderyng how he was infourmed ageynst Gueryn her\nhusban&dtail;.  Neuerthele he sayd, 'By my feyth, fayre\nlady, I thanke you of your grete curtoysye that ye offre\nme / but this requeste I ought not to agree, For men haue youen to me knowlege that your husband hath\nnot deseruyd it ayenst my lord, my fader, & me / how\nbe it, my fayre lady, I wyl wel that ye knowe that I am\nnot come for to make warre ayenst ladyes &\ndamoyselles / and be ye of this sure, that neyther to you nor\nto none of your fortres I wyl nought say nor hurt, yf\nyour husban&dtail; be not there' / And she thenne said:\n'gramercy, my lord.  But I requyre you, that it playse\nyou to shew me the cause of your indignacyon that ye\nhaue vnto my lord myn husban&dtail;, For I am in certain\nnother he nor I haue neuer do no thin&gtee; to our\nknowleche that shuld be your dysplaysure / and I byleue\nthat yf it might plese you to here my lord & husban&dtail;\n& his escuse, that ye shal fyn&dtail; them that thus haue\ninformed you, be not matere of trouth / and my lor&dtail;,\ntherupon I make me stron&gtee; that in conclusyon ye shal\nfynde as I say.' In this partye sheweth thistory, that whan geffray\nher&dtail; the lady thus speke he thought a lytel, & syn\nansuer&dtail; & said: 'By my feyth, lady, yf he goodly can\nexcuse hym that he haue not falsed hys feyth, I shalbe\nglad therof / & I shal receyue hym gladly in his\nexcusacyons with his felawes & a&llbar; theire complyces / and\nfrom this day seuen nyght I gyue hym saaf gooyng &\ncommyng, and fourty personnes with hym.'  Thenne\ntoke the lady her leue & retourned to Valbruyant,\nwhere she lefte her children / and acompanyed with\nte&nmacr; knightes and squyers, & with thre damoyselles\ndeparted, & rode so long tyl she came to Mountfrayn,\nwhere she was receyued joyously of her lord & his\nfrendes, to whom she recounted how gueryn her lord\nhad safconduyte of geffray for hym, & fourty personnes\nwit&hbar; hym / & yf he may excuse  hym geffray shal\nhere hym gladly, and shal admynystre hym al\nrayson.  'By my feyth,' said an auncyent knight, 'thenne sha&llbar;\nwe haue a good traytye with hym / For there nys none that may say that euer we mysdyde in eny thin&gtee; ayenst\nour souerayne lord naturel.  Yf Claude, that was our\nCousyn, had vs requyred of ayde, yf he neded, & we\nhad promysed hym to helpe hym / not for that we ne\nhaue yet mysdon / nother geffray nor none other may\nnot say that euer we had the helmet on heed, nor \u00feat\nwe yssued euer out of our places for to comforte or\nayde hym ayenst geffray by no wyse / goo we thenne\nsurely toward geffray, & lete me doo there witha&llbar;, For\nI doubte not but that we shal haue good traytye with\nhym.'  The frendes & cousyns of gueryn confermed\nthis propos, & made theire appareyl for to goo toward\ngeffray on the iii de day folowyng.  And thenne the\nlady departed, & retourned to Valbruyant, where she\nsent for breed, wyne, capons, chikkons, conyns, & suche\nvytay&llbar;, with hey & ootys, and presented it to geffray /\nbut he neuer receyued of it / but suffred that who\nwold toke of it for his money / and the said lady lete\ngeffray haue knowleche how her lord & his frendes\nshuld come toward hys grace. / Here sayth thystory, that Gueryn of Valbruyant &\nguerard hys neuew, taryed for theire frendes at\nmountfrayn / and whan they were come they mounted\non theire horses & rode tyl they came to valbruyant /\nand on the morne they sent wor&dtail; to Geffray of theire\ncommyng, and that they were al redy to come toward\nhys goo&dtail; grace to theire excuse.  And geffray ansuer&dtail;:\n\u00feat he was apparaylled to receyue them.  And \u00feenne\nthey departed fro the Castel & came tofore the tente\nof geffray, to whom they made theire obeyssaunce ryght\nhonourably.  And there thauncyent knight of whiche\nI spak tofore toke the word, & sai&dtail;: \"Mighty &\npuyssaunt lord, we are come hither toward your highnesse\nfor this, that we vnderstan&dtail; how ye are infourmed\nayenst vs, that we were consentyn&gtee; to the ylnesse &\ndysobedyence of Claude ayenst our souerayne lord naturel, your fader.  My lord, it is wel trouth that the\nsaid Claude our Cousyn, tofore hys folysshe enterpryse,\nhe assembled vs togidre, & thus said to vs: 'Fayre\nlordes, ye be a&llbar; of my lynage & kynrede / & I of\nyours / wherfore rayson requyreth that we loue eche\nother.'  Thenne say&dtail; we / 'by my feyth, ye say\ntrouth / but wherfor say ye soo?' And thenne he\nansuer&dtail; couertly: 'Fayre lordes, I doubte me to haue\nshortly a stron&gtee; werre & to haue a doo with a\nstrong partye; Wherefor I wyl wete yf ye wold helpe\nme' / & we thenne asked of hym / ayenst who&mmacr; /\nhe ansuer&dtail;: 'we shuld knowe it al in tyme, & that\nhe was not parfytte fren&dtail;, who that relenquysshed\nhys cousyn at hys nede.'  Thenne said we to hym,\n'we wyl wel that ye knowe that there nys none so\ngrete in this countrey, ne so myghty, yf he wyl\nhurt or dommage you, but that we shal helpe you to\nkepe & susteyne you in  your ryght.'  and vpon that\nhe departed / and syn had he many rancours ayenst\nsome where we ayded hym / but my lord wete it wel\nthat fro the tyme of hys dysobedyence to my lord your\nfader, we ne doubte nor fere ney\u00feer god nor man that\nwe euer putte piece of harneys on vs / nor that none of\nvs a&llbar; yssued out of his fortres, nother for hym nor for\nhis faytte / and the contrary shal be nother knowen\nnor fon&dtail;, For herof we wyl not haue grace / but we\nrequyre only right & justice / and yf there be other\ncause that our euyl wyllers might haue contryued vpon\nvs thrugh enuye or hate / I say by right that ye ne\nowe to be therfore indigned ayenst vs, \u00feat are very\nsubgets & obedyent to my lord, your fader\nRaymondyn of Lusynen, For yf some were wyllin&gtee; to vexe or\nmoleste vs by ony wyse ye oughte to helpe & kepe vs /\nand herof I can no more say, For we can not thinke\nthat none of vs dide euer that thin&gtee; that myght\ndysplayse my lord your fader.  Wherfor we al present beseche & pray you that ye be not infourmed but of\nrayson.\" / Whan geffray had her&dtail; thexcuse of the ol&dtail; knyght\nthat spake for a&llbar;, he called his Counsey&llbar; to\nhym / and syn said to them: 'Fayre lordes, what seme\nyow of this fayte? me semeth that these folke excuse\nthem self fu&llbar; wel.'  'By my feyth,' sayd they a&llbar; in\ncommyn, 'that is trouth / nor ye can not aske of\nthem, but that ye make them to swere vpon the holy\nEuaungylles, that yf the siege had be layed tofore\nsyon / they had socoured Claude or not ayenst you /\nand yf they swere ye / they are your enemyes / and to\nthe contrary, yf they swere that noo / ye owe not to\nbere to them euyl wy&llbar;.'  To this they a&llbar; accorded /\n& therewith concluded theire counsey&llbar;.  And thenne\nwere gueryn & hys frendes called tofore geffray / and\nafter he had recorded to them the sayd conclusyon /\nthey said that gladly they shuld swere as they\ndyde.  Wherfore they had peas with geffray, and syn went\nwith hym al about the Countre vysytyn&gtee; the Fortresses\n& places by the space of two monethes.  And after\nGeffray toke leue of the Barons there / and lefte\ngouernours to kepe & rewle the Countrey / and syn departed\n& retourned to Lusynen, where he was gretly festyed\nof hys fader & moder, that were glad of his\nretourne.  Thenne was there come a knyght of poytou fro\nCypre, whiche had reported tydynges how the Calyphe\nOf Bandas, and the grete Carmen were arryued in\nArmenye / and moche they had adommaged the kynge\nGuyon.  Also how kynge vryan had tydynges how\nthey entended to make werre ayenst hym in\nCypre.  Wherfore he made hys assemble of men of armes & of\nshippes, for to recountre & fyght with them in the\nsee. For his entencion was not to suffre them to entre in his\nlan&dtail;.  Whan thenne Geffray vnderstode these tydynges\nhe sware by the good lord, that shuld not be without hym, and that to long he ha&dtail; kept his fyre / and said\nto Raymondin hys fader, & to Melusyne his moder /\nthat they wold make hym cheuysaunce of help for to\ngoo ayde hys bretheren ayenst thenemyes of god / And\nthey accorded therto / so that he promyse&dtail; them to\nretourne within a yere day toward them. Ryght joyous was geffray whan his fader had\ngraunted hym his wy&llbar;.  and thenne he prayed\nthe knight that was come fro Cipre, that he wold\nretourne with hym, & that he shuld rewar&dtail; hym wel\ntherof.  'By my feyth', sayd the knight / 'men telleth\nme as touching your prowes may none compare / and I\nshal go with you for to see yf ye can doo more than\nVryan & Guyon your bretheren; For thoo two I knowe\nryght wel.' 'By my feyth, sire knight,' said geffray,\n'it is a lytel thing of my faytte concernyn&gtee; the\npuyssaunce of my lordes, my brethern / but I thanke you\nof this lybera&llbar; offre to goo with me / & I shall meryte\nyou, therfore, yf it playse god.'  Thenne he made hys\nmandement & dyde so moc&hbar;, that he assembled\nxiiii. C. men of armes, & wel iij. C. arbalestres, and made them\nto drawe towar&dtail; Rochelle / And raymondyn &\nmelusyne were there, whiche had don arryued many\nvesselles, & wel purueyed of vytaylles\nnecessary.  And thenne Geffray toke leue of his fader & of hys\nmoder, & entred into the see with his companye, &\nsaylled so \u00feat they lost syght of lan&dtail;, For they made\ngoo&dtail; way.  Here resteth thystorye of them to speke /\nand begynneth to speke of the Calyphe of Bandas & of\nthe Sawdan of Barbarye, that was nevew to the sawdan\nthat was slayn in the batay&llbar; vpon the heed of Saynt\nAndrew aboue the black montayne. Thystorye sheweth vs that the Caliphe of Bandas &\nthe Saudan of Barbarye / the kyn&gtee; Anthenor\nof Anthioche / and the admyral of querdes had made togidre theire affyaunce, that neuer they shuld retourne\ntyl they had dystroyed the kynge Vryan of Cipre, and\nguyon the kyn&gtee; of Armanye his brother / and had wel\nassembled to the nombre of xvi. Ml sarasyns, & had\ntheire shippes a&llbar; prest to thentent to arryue first in\nArmanye / & first of a&llbar; theire werkes to dystroye\nthe yle of Rodes, & after the royalme of Armanye / &\nso passe in to Cypre to dystroye & putte to deth / &\nhad sworne that they shuld make kyn&gtee; Vryan to dey\non the crosse / & hys wyf & his children they shuld\nbrenne.  But as the wyse man saith / 'the fole\nproposeth & god dysposeth' / and at that season were\nmany espyes emon&gtee; them as wel of armenye as of\nrodes / and there was one of the maister of Rodes spyes\nthat was so Lyke a Sarasyn that no man mysdymed\nhym for other than a Sarasyn, &  had the langage as a\nman of the same Countrey; the whiche knewe the\nsecretes of the sarasyns / and syn departed fro them &\ncame to baruth, where he fon&dtail; a barke \u00feat wold say&llbar;\nto Turckye to fette marchandyse, and entred in it.  And\nwhan they had good wynd they toke vp theire ancres\n& saylled so long that they sawe the yle of Rodes,\nwhere they came to refressh them there / and soone\nafter the sayd espye went out of the shipp and toke\nhys way toward the Cite of rodes, where he fonde the\nmaister of rodes, that welcommed hym & demanded\nwhat tydynges.  And the spye recounted to hym al\nthat the Sarasyns entended for to doo / the whic&hbar;\ntydynges the maister of rodes dyde doo knowe by\nwrytyng to the two bretheren kynges of Armenye & of\nCipre / and that they shuld entre in to the see with\n\u00feeire power / and that he shuld mete with them at the\nporte of Japhe / and thenne whan guyon kyn&gtee; of\narmanye vnderstode this he entred in to the see, & had\nwith hym to the nombre of six thousan&dtail; men of armes,\n& wel iii. Ml balesters, & ca&mmacr;e sayllyng to Rodes, where as he fonde the grete maister at the porte / And whan\nthe grete pryour of Rodes sawe him he had grete joye, &\nforthwith he entred with hym & al his puyssaunce into\nthe see to the nombre of iii.C bretheren men of armes,\n& vi.C balesters or crosbowmen.  Whan they were\nassembled togidre fayre was the Flote, For by very\nestymacion they were fonde to the nombre of ten\nthousand men of armes / &  about xviii.C what balesters\nas Archers.  And wete it wel, it was a fayre syght, For\nthe baners & standarts wayued with the wyn&dtail; / and\nthe gold & azure vpon the helmets & armures\nresplendysshe&dtail; brigh & clere, that it was grete meruay&llbar; / and\nsyn they rowed toward the porte of Japhe, wher the\nSarasyns had made theire nauye to dryue.  And here\nresteth thystorye of them to speke, & sheweth of vryan\nas ye may here herafter. / Thystory sayth, that the kyn&gtee; Vryan made & sent\nhis mandement thrugh al his lan&dtail; of Cypre, for\nto gadre his baronye togidre with theire puyssaunce, &\nwhan they were assemble&dtail; at the porte of Lymasson he\ntoke leue of the quene Ermyne, his wyf, & entred into\nthe see.  And wete it they were in nombre, what men\nof armes as balesters & archers xiiii. Ml , And \u00feenne they\ndeparted fro the porte, & saylled by suche force of\nwynde that quene Ermyne, which was vpon a hye\ntoure, lost soone the syght of them.  And wete it wel\nthat geffray with the grete toth, within thre days after\narryued vnder Lymasson / but the maister of the porte\nsuffred them not to entre within the porte.  how be it\nhe was abasshed to see the armes of Lusynen in theire\nbaners vpon the toppes of theire shippes, & wyst not\nwhat to deme or say; wherfore he went anoone to the\nCastel & anounced these tydynges to the quene / And\nshe \u00feat was fu&llbar; sage, said to hym / 'go ye to know what folke they be, For without treson, they are some\nof my lordes lynee / speke thenne with them, hauyng\nyour men prest & redy vpon the porte to thende, yf\nthey wol&dtail; arryue by force, that ye may withstan&dtail;\nthem' / and he anone fulfylled the quenes\ncommandement & came to the barryers of the clos & demanded\nof them what they sought.  Thenne ansuer&dtail; the knight\nwhiche tofore that tyme had be in Cypre / 'lete us\narryue, For it is geffray, kyn&gtee; vryans brother, that\ncommeth to socoure & ayde hym ayenst the Sarasyns.'\nAnd thenne whan the maister of the porte vnderstode\n\u00fee knight he knew hym anone, & thus sayd: 'Sire,\nthe kyn&gtee; is departed from hens thre dayes agoo, &\nhath take hys way and hys puyssaunce with hym\ntoward the porte of Japhe, For he wyl not suffre, yf he\nmay, that paynemes entre in his royame / but pray, my\nlord, hys brother, that it playse hym to co&mmacr;e & see\nthe quene that ryght ioyous shal be of hys comyn&gtee;.'\nAnd he al this said to geffray, whiche anoone entred\ninto a lytel galyote, & with hym the said knight and\nother of hys felawship, & rowed to the chayne that\nanoone was open / & so they entred in to the hauen,\nwhere as they fonde many noble men that honourably\nreceyued geffray & his felawship, whiche meruaylled\nthem gretly of hys grete courage & of hys fyersnes, &\nbrought hym toward the queene that abode for hym,\nholdyng her sone Henry in her armes.  And as Geffray\napproched to her she enclyned herself tofore him / and\ngeffray to her made his obeyssaunce & toke her vp &\nkyssed her / & syn said to her, 'Madame, my sustir, god\nyeue you joye of al that your herte desyreth' / And\nshe welcommed hym frendly & honourably.  And\nthenne geffray toke vp his neuew Henry, that kneled\ntofore hym.  What shuld I now make long\ncompte.  Geffray was thenne glad / & the port was open & hys nauye entred, & whan they were wel refresshed geffray\nsaid to the quene: 'Madame, I wyl departe, lete me\nhaue a maronner that wel knoweth the costes of this\nsee, so that I may fyn&dtail; my brother.' To this ansuer&dtail; the quene, 'My right dere brother /\nBy my feyth, I wold it had cost me a thousand\npoundes that ye were now with my lord, your brother,\nFor wel I knowe he shal haue grete joye of your\ncommyn&gtee;.' and thenne she called to her maister\nof the porte, & sayd / 'go make a galyot to be shipped\nredy with ten oores, & seke for the sagest maronner\n& best patron that can be fon&dtail;, for to conduyte my\nlord my brother toward my lord.'  'Madame,' ansuer&dtail;\nthe maister of the port, 'I haue wel a rampyn alredy\nshipped to rowe, wel armed & vytaylle&dtail;, & resteth\nno more than to meve & departe.'  Thenne was geffray\nright glade & toke hys leue of the quene & of his\nnevew, & entred in to his shipp / and the said rampyn\nor galley gyded hym / & so departed with hys flote, &\nrowed & made good way, so that in short space they\nof the porte lost the syght of them.  And the quene\nErmyne prayed deuoutely to god that they myght\nretourne with joye.  Of hym I shal leue to speke.  But\nVryan his bro\u00feer rowed so lon&gtee; tyl they perceyued the\nporte of Japhe, & the bygge & grete vesselles that\nwere there assembled / and thenne was there comme\nthe Caliphe / the Saudan of Barbarye, the kyn&gtee; of\nAnthioche, & thadmyral of querdes, with theire\npuyssaunce.  And was by them concluded the kin&gtee; anthenor\n& thadmyra&llbar; shuld make vantward, & shuld hold\nthe way toward rodes / and yf that they neded socour\nthey shuld wryt to the Caliphe & to the Sawdan,\nwhiche alwayes be redy to helpe & ayde them / and\nthe kyn&gtee; antenor of Anthyoche & thadmyral of Cordes\ndeparted fro the porte of Japhe with fourty thousand\npanemes, & toke theire way toward Rodes by suche wyse that Vryan knew nothing of theire departyn&gtee; /\nand had rowed but two dayes journey whan they\nperceyued kyng guyon & the nauye of rodes, and also the\nCristens perceyued them / Thenne was there grete\nalarme of bothe partes, and soone they borded\ntogidre.  There was grete occysyon & horryble medlee / and at\nthe first recountryng were six galleyes of the sarasyns\nsounken & perysshed in the see / And the noble crystens\nendeuoyred them self wel & faught valyauntly, But\nthe force & the quantyte of the Sarasyns was grete /\nand the Crysten peuple susteyne&dtail; grete charge, & had\nbe dyscomfyted yf go&dtail; of hys grace had not conduyted\ngeffray that part as it sha&llbar; be recounted herafter. Thystory saith, that geffray & his peple saylled in\nthe see by force of wynd \u00feat they had at theire\nwy&llbar; so long, that they approuched the place where\nthe batay&llbar; was.  And first of all the rampyn that\nconduyted them approuched so nygh that they sawe them\nfyght / and anone retourned & said to geffray, 'Sire,\ncommande al men to be redy, For we haue perceyued\nthe batay&llbar; / & as we suppose they are sarasyns &\ncrysten fyghting togidre.'  Thenne rowed the galyote &\ncame so nygh the baytay&llbar; that they herde crye on hye,\n'Cordes & Anthioche' / and at the other part 'Lusynen\n& saynt Jo&hbar;n of Rodes' / and immedyatly retourned the\nrampyn toward geffray, & said to him, 'Sire, at that one\nparty they ben sarasyns / and at the other part theire\ncallyng is Lusynen & Saynt Johan of rodes / but\ncertaynly it is not the kyn&gtee; vryan / but I byleue, my\nlord, that it is the kyng guyon hys brother & the\nmaister of Rodes that thus fyght with the Sarasyns.'\n'Ryght foorth,' sayd geffray, 'goo we to them asprely' /\nthenne they haunce&dtail; saylles vp & saylled foorth by\nsuch wyse that it semed as it had be the vyreton of a\nCrosbow, & stemed the shippes of the sarasyns in suche\nmanere that they were sparpylle&dtail;, so that there rested not foure of al the flote, and cryed 'Lysynen' with a\nhigh voys.  Wherfor the Ermayns & they of Rodes\nbyleued \u00feat it had be the kyng Vryan that were c&omacr;me\nfro cypre.  And thenne toke they goo&dtail; herte to them\ncourageously.  And the kyng of Anthioche & thad\nmyra&llbar; of Cordes gadred ayen theire peple, and rane\nvpon the crysten with grete force.  But geffray & hys\npeuple, that were fresshe & new, ouerrane them in\nsuche manere that they dommaged gretly the sarasyns/\nand thenne the vessel where geffray was / borded the\nvessel of the kynge anthenor & were chayne&dtail;\ntogidre.  And geffray entred into the vessel of the kyn&gtee; & bygan\nto make grete occysyon of the sarasyns, & his peuple\nentred & faught so valyauntly with suche a strengt&hbar;\nthat there was no sarasyn so hardy that durst shew\nhym or make deffense / and many of them for theyre\nrelyf suppose&dtail; to haue entred into thadmyral shipp\n& they were drowned / the whiche admyral, guyon &\nhis peuple assaylled strongly, & drowned foure of the\nsarasyns shippes.  The batay&llbar; was fyers & horryble\n& thoccysyon hydouse / and briefly to say, the\nsarasyns were putte in suche manere so low that they\nhad no\u00fein&gtee; them to deffende. / Moche was the batay&llbar; hard & stron&gtee;, but aboue al\nother faught geffray manfully, & so dide the\npoyteuyns that were come with hym there, & so dyde\nguyon the maister of Rodes & theire peple / but they\nwere abasshe&dtail; for this that they cryed 'Lusynen' /\nbut thenne it was no saison tenquere.  And thenne the\nkyn&gtee; anthenor & thadmyral perceyued wel \u00feat the\ndyscomfiture fy&llbar; of them, For they \u00feenne had lost\nmore than the two partes of theire peple, wherfore they\nmade the resydu of theire peuple to withdraw them toward the port of Japhe to haue socour / and the said\nkyn&gtee; & admyral put them self in a shipp of auauntage\n& made grete say&llbar; fro the batay&llbar;, and whan the\nsarasyns perceyued they went after, he that might.  But\nthe Ermayns & they of Rodes ouertoke the moost part\n& putte them to deth & threw \u00feem ouerbord.  But\nwhan geffray perceyued the departyn&gtee; of the kyn&gtee;\nanthenor & the admyral, he dyde make say&llbar; & went\nafter with al hys nauye, & made so fast way that anoone\nhe lefte the Ermayns & the maister of Rodes at\nsterne.  And whan the rampyn ship of auauntage perceyued\ngeffray, the patron cryed to hys peuple with a hye\nvoys / 'after / after / fayre sires, For yf geffray leseth his\nway & faylleth to mete with hys brother, I shal neuer\ndare retourne to my lady.'  And thenne the kynge\nGuyon, that knew the rampyn, asked of the patron\nwhat was that lord cristen that so had socoured\nthem.  'By my feyth,' said the patron, 'it is geffray with the\ngrete toth, your brot\u00feer.'  And whan the kyng guyon\nvndersto&dtail; it he cryed with a hye voys, 'make more\nsay&llbar;, \u00feat we were with our brother, For yf he were\nperysshed I shuld neuer haue hertly joye.'  But \u00fee\nrampyn went tofore so fast that in short tyme he\nouertoke geffray, that was neer the sarasyns that\napprouched the porte of Japhe.  Here I shall leue to\nspeke of them, & shal shew of Vryan that tofore was\ncome to the port and had fyred sarasyns shippes\nthere / but the paynemes rescued them in theire best\nmanere / not that withstanding there were more than\nten vesselles brent. In this partye sheweth thystorye that Geffray with\nthe grete toeth pursiewed so lon&gtee; the king anthenor\n& thadmyral of Cordes, that they approuched nygh to\nthe port of Japhe, where they entred in / and geffray\nafter them; For by no manere he wol&dtail; leue them /\nthough men shewed to hym the grete multitude of paynemes that thenne were entred in to the vesselles to\nsocoure the kyn&gtee; anthenor.  But he anoone bygan the\nbatay&llbar; that was har&dtail; & morta&llbar;, in so moc&hbar; that the\nkyng and thadmyra&llbar; were constrayne&dtail; to take lan&dtail;,\nand went to the toune of Japhe, where they fon&dtail; the\ncalyphe of Bandas and the Sawdan of Barbarye that\nwere gretly abasshe&dtail; that so soone they were retourned,\nand demande&dtail; of the cause wherfore / and they\nrecounted to them al thaduenture, And how the kyng\nof armenye & the maister of Rodes were dyscomfyte&dtail;,\nhad not a knyght araged or wod&dtail; that came &\nsocoured them with a few peuple that crye&dtail; 'Lusynen' /\n& there may none withstan&dtail; hym, whiche is now\nyonder at the porte where he fyghteth ayenst our peuple /\nand al that he recountreth is brought to hys\nende.  And whan the sawdan vndersto&dtail; it he had no wy&llbar; to lawghe / but said, 'By machomet, it is tolde me of ol&dtail;\nthat I, & many other of our sette and lawe, shall\nsusteyne grete parels vpon the see, by the heyres of\nLusynen / but yf we might haue them on lan&dtail;, and\nthat our peuple were out of \u00fee shippes they shuld be\nsoone a&llbar; dyscomfyted.'  'By a&llbar; our goddes,' said the\nCaliphe, 'ye say trouth, / and also yf they were here\ndystroye&dtail; we shuld subdue lyghtly Rodes, cypre, &\narmanye / Lete vs thenne make our peuple to come to\nlan&dtail;, and suffre the Cristen to take peasybly theire\nlandin&gtee;.'  But in certayn for nought they spake soo,\nFor they yssued out without ony commandement, by\nthe vertue & strengt&hbar; of Geffray that therto constrayne&dtail;\nthem / and Geffray with his peuple pursiewed them at\nlan&dtail;, & chaced them vnto the Cite of Japhe / and all\nthoo that were ouertake were put to deth / and they\nthat entred in the toun crye&dtail; 'treson, treson!'  Thenne\nwere the gates shette, and euery man went to hys\ngarde / and geffray retourned to his shippes / and\ncommanded that the horses shuld be ha&dtail; out alan&dtail;.  For he said that neuer he shuld departe but he shuld dey\nor he shuld make men to say, that Geffray with the\ngrete toth hath be here. Thystorye telleth vs that whyle Geffray was about\nto haue out of the shippes hys horses, the\nrampyn perceyued the baners & penons of the kyn&gtee;\nvryan, that moc&hbar; strongly scarmysshed the nauye of\nthe sarasyns that knew nothin&gtee; that geffray had take\nlan&dtail;, For they had take the deep of the porte.  And the kynge and thadmyra&llbar; were arryued at the narowest\nsyde to be the sooner on lan&dtail;.  Thenne departed the\nrampyn shipp of auauntage, and rowed toward\nvryan.  And thenne they recountre&dtail; guyon, whiche asked of\nthe patron tydynges of geffray.  'Yonder he hath take\nland,' said the patron, '& hath chace&dtail; the paynemes\nvnto \u00fee Cite / and yonder is the kyng vryan your\nbro\u00feer, that scarmyssheth theire nauye, to whom I goo\nfor to anounce hym your auenture, and the commyng\nof geffray, his brother' / And thenne the rampyn\nrowed fast, and came to vryan to whom, after his\nobeyssaunce don, he recounted al the faytte.  Wherof\nVryan thanked god deuoutely / & cryed to hys peple,\n'auaunt, lordes, thinke to doo wel, For our enemyes\nmay not escape vs, but that they be other slayn or\ntake.'  Thenne the crysten borded theire enemyes, the\nwhic&hbar; were gretly abasshed of this, that they had\nknowleche that the kyn&gtee; anthenor & thadmyra&llbar; were\nretourned to Japhe.  wherfor they toke land who that\nmight, & fledd toward the toun.  And thenne whan\nthe Calyphe and the saudan sawe theire peple alan&dtail;,\nthey dyde send ambaxades toward the prynces Cristen\nfor to haue trews the space of thre dayes, & that they\nshuld suffre theire landin&gtee;, & on the foureth day they\nshuld gyue them journey of batay&llbar;.  Kinge Vryan\naccorded therto, and sent wor&dtail; therof to his brethern\nguyon and geffray / and thus they landed peasybly, and assembled theire peple togidre.  Thenne was the Joye\ngrete emon&gtee; the thre bretheren, and theire oost was\nnombred xxii. Ml what men of armes / balesters &\narchers. Thystorye sayth that the thre bretheren and theire\npeuple made moche eche of other, & refresshed\nthem durin&gtee; the trews.  But \u00feanne the Sawdan of\nDamaske that had knowleche of the crystens landing\nsent wor&dtail; to the Calyphe & to the sawdan of\nBarbarye, that they shuld not fyght with the crysten\ntyl he were come with them, & that they shul&dtail; take\nothre thre days of trews / & so they dide; wherto the\nnoble prynces crysten accorded.  And duryng that\nterme the Caliphe & & and the sawdan of Barbarye dyde\nwithdraw theyre peuple toward Damaske to thentent\nthat they might have the Cristen more within the lan&dtail;,\nso that none might flee to theyre nauye; but he were\nouertake & slayne.  For they wen&dtail; to haue a&llbar; theire\nwy&llbar; vpon the Crysten.  For they were after the\nsaudan of Damaske was assembled with them to the\nnombre of VII score thousan&dtail; fyghtyng men / and \u00fee\ncrysten were but xxxi. Ml good men / the whic&hbar;, whan\nthey knew of the departyn&gtee; of the sarasyns fro Japhe,\nthey were fu&llbar; dolaunt; For they supposed they had\nfledd / but for nought they wend soo / for at ende of\nsix dayes they came & approuched nygh them, & on\nthe morne gaf them batay&llbar;.  Thenne came a trucheman\nmounted vpon a dromadary, whiche alighted tofore the\ntentes of the thre bretheren, and humbly salued them /\nand they rendred hym gretyn&gtee; / and he beheld them\nlong or he spake.  For he wondred moche of theire\nnoble maynten & fyers contenaunce / and in especial\nhe meruaylled moche of Geffray that was the hyest of\npersonne, & saw the toeth that passed ouer the lyppe\nalong hys cheke; wherof he was so abasshed that\nalmost he coude not speke / but at last he said to kynge Vryan in this wyse.  'Noble kyng of Cypre /\nmy right redoubted lordes the Sawdants of Barbarye &\nof Damaske / the Calyphe of Bandas / the kynges of\nAnthioche & Danette & thadmyra&llbar; of Cordes send\nwor&dtail; by me to you that they be prest redy to lyuere\nyou batay&llbar;, & they tary after you in a medowe vnder\nDamaske where ye, with al your puyssaunce may\ncome / saf and peasybly there to make and take\nthere your lodgys tofore them wheresomeuer it playse\nyou / and by auenture whan ye haue sene theire\npuyssaunce ye sha&llbar; fynd some good & amyable traytye\nwith my sai&dtail; lordes.  For certaynly it is not to your\npower to withstan&dtail; theire strengt&hbar;.'  And whan\ngeffray her&dtail; there wordes, he sayd to hym / 'goo thou\nto thy kynges & sawdants, & to thy Caliphe / and say\nthem that yf there were none only but I & my peuple,\nyet wold I fyght / & say them \u00feat of theire trews we\nhaue nought to doo / and whan thou shalt come to\nthem say that geffray with the grete toth deffyeth them /\nand anoone after that thou art departed from hens I\nshal sawte the Cite of Japhe, & shal fyre it / and al the\nsarasyns that I shal fyn&dtail;, I shal putte them to deth /\nand say to them, as thou passe by that they puruey\nthem wel, For I ryght foorth sha&llbar; departe to asay&llbar;\nthem.' And whan the trucheman or messager her&dtail; this\nansuere, he was al abasshed / and without eny more\nproces he lept vpon his dromadary, For he had so grete\nfeer of the fyersnes of geffray that alwayes he loked\nbehyn&dtail; hym, for fere that he had folowed hym / &\nsayd in hym self: 'By mahon, yf al the other were\nsuche as that with the grete toth, our lordes, nor theire\npuyssaunce were not able to withstand them.'  And\nthenne he came to Japhe, & said to them that geffray\nwith the grete toth wold come anoon tassay&llbar; theire\nCyte, and that he had sworne that he shuld putte in subgection of hys swer&dtail; al them that he fon&dtail;.  Thenne\nwere they a&llbar; abasshed / and wete it wel that the more\nparte of the peple there fled for fere toward Damaske,\nand toke with them theire goodes.  And anoon geffray\ndide blow vp hys trompettes, & armed hys peple, & went\nincontynent to sawte the toun, and wol&dtail; neuer cesse\ntherof, For ony thing that his bre\u00feern said / and sware\nby god that he shuld shewe them suche tokens that men\nshuld knowe that he had ben in surye.  But here seaceth\nthistorye of hym, & speketh of the forsaid messanger\n\u00feat rode so long that he came tofore the lodgys of the\nsarasyns at Damaske. In this party, sayth thystory, that the messager rode\nso fast vpon his dromadary that he cam / vnto\nthoost tofore Damaske / & fon&dtail; in the tente of the\nCalyphe the two sawdans, the kin&gtee; anthenor /\nthadmyral of Cordes, the kyn&gtee; golofryn of Danette, &\nmany other that asked tydynges of the  Cristens.  And\nthe messager them said / 'I haue don your\ncommandement & message / but whan I shewed vnto them,\nyf that they had seen your puyssaunce it wold haue\nbe a meane of traytye with you / and thenne one of\nthem that had oo grete toth, wold not suffre the kyng\nof Cypre to haue the wordes, but he hymself said \u00feus,\n\"Goo thou to thy kynges and sawdants, & say them we\nhaue not doo with theire trews, / & that yf there wer\nbut he & his peple only, yet wold he fyght with you\" /\nand morouer said to me / that assoone as I shuld come\nto you that I shuld take you ayen \u00fee patents of your\ntrews, & that ye shuld beware of hym / and that in\ndespyte of you a&llbar; he wol&dtail; assawte Japhe, & putte the\nfyre thrugh al the toun & destroye them for euer / and\nthat thus I shuld say to them whan I passed by the Cite /\nand so haue I doo / and wete it wel that the more part of the Cytezeyns be come after me, &\n\nimmedyatly after my departyn&gtee; I her&dtail; hys trompettes blowe\nthassawte of Japhe / & ye coude neuer thinke thorryble\n& fyers contenaunces of the prynces crysten with theire\npuyssaunce / And wete it wel after the semblaunce that\nthey shew, ye be not of power tabyde them, & in\nespecial he with the grete toth hath none other fere\nbut that ye shal flee or they come to you.'  And whan\nthe saudan of Damaske vndersto&dtail; it, he bygan to lawg&hbar;,\n& sai&dtail;, 'By machomi&dtail;, in asmoche as I haue perceyued\nnow your hardynes, ye shal be the first in batay&llbar; ayenst\nhym with the grete toth.'  Wherto ansuerd the\nmessager / 'vnhappy be that heure or day that I approche\nhym / but yf there be a grete ryuere or the toures or\nwalles of Damaske or some other Fortes betwix hym\n& me / and yf I doo other, lete my lord mahomi&dtail;\ndrowne me,' / & therwith bygane euery personne to\nlawhe.  But there were suche that lawhe&dtail;, that\naftirward, yf they might haue ha&dtail; leyser, they wol&dtail; haue\nwept.  Now sha&llbar; I shew how geffray assawted Japhe,\nand toke it by force, and putte to deth a&llbar; the sarasyns\nthere, and toke their hauoir and goodes out of the Cyte /\n& bare it vnto the vesselles, and after sette fyre on the\nCite / and this don, retourned the crysten to theire\nlodgys, where geffray requyred his bretheren that they\nshuld take hym, the maister of Rodes, & hys peuple, to\nmake the vantgarde / & they were agree&dtail; / and that\nsame nyght they rested them tyl on the morowe. The next day, as the hystory wytnesseth, after the\nmasse her&dtail;, desloged the vanwar&dtail;, and after the\ngrete batayll, & the sommage & syn the ryergarde /\nand it was a noble syght to see thoost & the fayre\nordynaunce to departe.  Thenne came a spye to\ngeffray, & hym sai&dtail;:  'Sire, about half a leghe hens\nben a thousand sarasyns, whiche drawe them toward\nbaruth to kepe the hauen of the toune.'  to whom\ngeffray asked / 'canst conduyte me thither?' / 'ye, by my feyth, sire,' sayd the spye.  Thenne said geffray to\nthe maister of rodes, that he shuld conduyte the\nvanwarde, puttyng fyre vpon the way where he went, to\nthentent he shuld not fay&llbar; to fyn&dtail; hym by the trasse\nof the fumyer / and the maister of Rodes said / 'it shal\nbe don.'  And thanne departed geffray with the spye,\nand went before, where he perceyued the sarasyns\ncommyng fro a mountayn; & he shewed to geffray the\nsarasyns, whic&hbar; was joyful therof, & hasted hys\npeuple.  and whan he had ouertake them / he sware: 'by god /\nye gloutons! ye may not me escape' / & so rane vpon\nthem, & ouerthrew the first that he recountred to the\nerth, & syn drew hys swer&dtail;, & dyde meruayllous\nfayttes of armes, & his peuple in lyke wyse.  What\nnede is to speke more of the sarasyns, they were\ndyscomfyte, & fled toward Baruth, & the Crysten in the\nchaas.  And whan the sarasyns of baruth sawe the\nfleers, they anoone knew them, & lete fa&llbar; the bridge,\n& opened the gates & barryers / thenne the fleers entred\nwithin the toune / but alwayes geffray folowe&dtail; so\nhastly, that he entred with them within the town with\nwel fyue C men of armes.  And whan Geffray was\nentred he commanded to kepe [the] gate tyl the\nresydu of hys peuple were come / And thenne bygan\nthe batay&llbar; to be fyers & stron&gtee; / but neuertheles the\nSarasyns might not endure, but fled at another yate out\nof the toun.  And he that \u00feenne had a good hors was\nwel besta&dtail;, For they sporyd fast, som toward the Cite\nof tryple, & some toward Damaske.  And geffray &\nhis peple slew al the sarasyns that they fon&dtail; in the\ntoun, and threw them in the see / and he that sawe\nthe toun strong & the Castel nygh the see, fayre porte\ngarnysshed with toures for the sauegarde of the nauye /\nsayd / 'that place shuld be kepe for hym self' / and\nthere geffray lefte two houndred men of armes & a C balesters of his peple / and he hymself soiourned\nthere a&llbar; that same nyght.  And on the morne he toke\nleue of his men that he lefte there, & rode after thoost\nby the trace of the fumyer & smoke / but the maister\nof Rodes was afer&dtail; lest he shul&dtail; haue grete\nempeschement /.  Here seaceth the hystorye of hym / and sheweth\nof the fleers out of Japhe toward Damaske, whiche\ncame to thoost at the tente of the Sawdan, where as the\nlordes sarasyns were / and pyteously recounted to them\nthe dystruction of Japhe / how the Cristen ha&dtail; putte\nto deth bothe yong & ol&dtail;, & sette fyre on eche part\nof the toun.  Whan the saudants & kynges sarasyns\nvndersto&dtail; it, they were fu&llbar; dolaunt.  'By al our\ngoddes,' said the saudan of Damaske, 'Moche har&dtail;\nben the crysten, & they doubte nought as it semeth /\nbut fu&llbar; wel they knowe that they are not of power to\nwithstan&dtail; our grete puyssaunce; wherefore they make\nsemblaunt, that nought they fere vs, & make suche\nsawtes while that we are ferre fro them / but yf we\nmarched foorth / no doubte they wold recule &\nwithdrawe them in to theire shippes.' 'By mahon,' said\nthe sawdan of Barbarye / 'yf they were here alle rosted\nor soden, & yf it were custome to ete suche flesshe, they\nwere not to the regarde of our peple suffysaunt for a\nbrekfast / by my lawe, yf there were but I & my peuple\nonly, yet shul&dtail; none repasse of them homwar&dtail;.'  But\nwhan the trucheman or messager her&dtail; hym so speke\nhe coude neuer hol&dtail; hys tonge, but that he sayd /\n'myghty sawdan, yf now ye sawe the kyng Vryan /\nthe kyng guyon hys brother, & he with the grete toth,\ntheire horryble & fyers contenaunce, shuld cause you\nto be in peas & cesse your grete menaces.  And wete\nit wel, or the werke be ful doo ye shal not haue them\nfo[r] so good chep as ye say / but oft he that menaceth\nis somtyme in grete fer & drede hym self, & aftirward\nouerthrawen' / And thenne whan the saudan vnderstode the messagers wordes, he said to hym: 'By\nMahomi&dtail;, fayre sire, I see wel by the grete hardynes\nthat is in you, ye wol&dtail; fayne be ordeyned at the first\nrecountre of \u00fee batay&llbar; ayenst Geffray with the grete\ntoeth.' & he ansuer&dtail;: 'By my lawe, sire, yf he be\nnot recountred of none other but of me / he may wel\nc&omacr;me surely; For I shal tourne myn heelys towar&dtail;\nhym / ye / one leghe or two ferre fro his personne.'\nThenne the lawhing was there grete / but soone after\nthey her&dtail; other tydynges, wherof they had no wy&llbar;\nto lawhe, For the fleers fro baruth forsayd came to\nthoost, and to them recounte&dtail; the dommage & pyte of\nthe toune of Baruth, and how geffray with the grete\ntoth had chaced \u00feem by force, & al the resydu of them\nhe had slayn / & 'by mahon,' said they, 'wete it wel\nhe is not of purpos to flee, For he hath lefte garnyson\nat Baruth, & wel vytaylled it, & commeth hy\u00feerwar&dtail;\nin al haste to hym possible / & men see nothin&gtee; thrugh\nal the Countre where he passeth but fyre & fla&mmacr;e, &\nthe wayes be a&llbar; couered with sarasyns that he & hys\npeple haue slayn.' Thenne whan the saudan of\nDamaske vnderstode it he was moc&hbar; dolaunt &\nangry.  'By mahomi&dtail;,' said he, 'I byleue fermely that he with\nthe grete toth hath a dyuel in his body.'  Thenne said\nthe saudan of Barbarye,'I am in doubte of that is tol&dtail;\nme.' 'What is that?' sai&dtail; the saudan of Damaske / 'it\nis said that the heyrs of Lusynen shal dystroye me, and\nthat our lawe shal by theire strengthe  be hurt &\ndommaged.'  Thenne was there none so hardy a Sarasyn\nbut that he shoke for fere.  And now cesseth thystorye\nof them, & retourneth to geffray. Thystorye sheweth in this partye, that so long rode\ngeffray with hys felawship, that he ouertoke the\nvanwarde that the maister of Rodes conduyted, whiche\nwas glade of his retourne, & asked how he had\nexployted.  And geffray recounted to hym how he & his peple, with thayde of god, he had wonne the toune,\ncastel, & hauen of baruth, and that by force they ha&dtail;\nchased a grete part of them that were within, and the\nresydu they had putte to deth / & how he had lefte\ncertayn nombre of his peuple to kepe it.  'By god,'\nsayd the maister of Rodes, 'ye haue wel don, & nobly\n& valyauntly exployted' / and soone these tydynges\nwere knowen thrugh thoost / & Vryan & Guyon were\njoyfu&llbar; therof.  'By my feyth,' said Vryan to Guyon:\n'Oure brother Geffray is of grete enterpryse & ryght\nvalyaunt in armes, and yf god of his grace yeue hym\nlong lyf, he shal do yet many grete actes worthy to be\nhad in mynde.' 'By my feyth,' said guyon, 'ye say\ntrouth.'  Long tyme went the two bretheren thus\nspekyng of the prowes of geffray / And so long marched \u00feeir\noost, that on an euen they lodged them by a ryuere\nfyue myle fro Damaske / & there came theire espyes,\nthat declared to them a&llbar; the manyere & contenaunce\nof the sarasyns.  And thenne they toke Counseyl to\nwete what best was to doo, & they concluded that on\nthe morne theire oost shuld lodge a leghe nygh to\nthe Sarasyns as they dide.  And thus on the morne\nthey departed, & was commande&dtail; that none shul&dtail;\nsette fyre on his lodgys, nor in none other place; to\nthende that the Sarasyns shuld not soone perceyue\ntheire commyng.  And briefly to say, so long they\nwent tyl they came to the place where they lodged\nthem togidre, & made \u00feat nyght good watche toward\ntheire enemyes. & after they souped & lay al nyght in\ntheire harneys.  And anoone aftir middenyght geffray,\naccompanyed with a thousand fyghting men, toke a\nguyde that wel knew the Countre, & went toward\nthoost of the Sarasyns al the couert.  & nygh therby\nwas a forest that dured a myle, and there he embusshed\n& sent wor&dtail; to thoost that they shuld be redy as to\nreceyue theire enemys. Thystorye testyfyeth that geffray at the day spryng,\nmounted on horsbake, with ij.  C fyghtyng men,\n& commanded them of thembusshe \u00feat for nothing that\nthey sawe they shuld not meue them tyl that they sawe\nhym & hys company recule, and thenne vpon them of\nthe chaas they shuld renne.  Thenne departed geffray,\n& went vpon a lytel montayne, and sawe the sarasyns\noost a&llbar; styl, & her&dtail; nothin&gtee;, as nobody ha&dtail; be\nthere.  Thenne was he dolaunt, that sooner he had not\nknowen theire contenaunce, For yf hys bretheren had\nbe there with theire peple, they shul&dtail; haue had good\nchep of sarasyns / but not withstanding, he sware that\nsyth he was so nygh, that he shuld make them to\nknowe his commyn&gtee;.  Thenne said geffray to hys\nfelawes: 'ryde we fast, & see that ye be not aslepe as\nthey are / & make no bruyt tyl I shal comman&dtail;\nyou.'  And they sai&dtail; that nomore shuld they doo.  Thenne\nthey rode al the couert nygh togidre, & and entred\ninto thoost, & wel perceyued that they were aslepe\non euery syde / geffray behel & sawe the grete\nmultitude of peuple / and syn he said in this wyse: 'By my\nfeyth, yf \u00feey were crysten, they were to be fer&dtail; &\ndredd / but yet they be not so good as dogges.' and with\nhis felawship went vnto the myddes of thoost, or they\nmade eny stryf.  And there geffray perceyued a ryche\ntente, and supposyng that it had be other the Caliphes\ntente or one of the saudants / said vnto hys peuple /\n'auaunt, lordes & good men, it is now tyme to chere &\nawake these houndes, for to long they haue\nslept.'  Thenne Geffray, & ten knightes with hym, entred in to\nthe sayd tente, & vpon them that were in smote with\ntheire swerdes, makyng heedes, armes, & legges to leue\nthe bodyes.  There was the noyse, & the cry grete &\nhydous to here / & wete it that it was \u00fee tente of the\nkyng Gallafryn of Danette; whic&hbar; anoone rose vp fro\nhys be&dtail;, & wel he supposed to haue fled out at the backsyde of hys tente, but geffray perceyued, & gaf\nhym suche a stroke with his swer&dtail; that was pesaunt, &\ncuttyng sharp as a raser, that he cleft hys hee&dtail; vnto\nthe brayne / & the sarasyn kyng fell doun dee&dtail; / and\nnone escaped of them that were in the tente; but they\nwere a&llbar; slayne.  And thenne cryeng 'Lusynen' they\nretourned thrug&hbar; thoost, puttyng to deth al the sarasyns\nthat they recountred.  Thenne was thoost wel awaked\n& made grete alarme / And anoone came these\ntydynges to the tente of the sawdan of Damaske, that\nsaid: 'What noyse is that I here yonder without?'\nThenne a sarasyn that came fro that part, which had\na broken hee&dtail;, in such manere \u00feat hys one eere lay\nvpon hys sholder / sayd to hym: 'Sire, that are x\ndyuelles, and theire meyne that haue entred into your\noost, whic&hbar; slee & ouerthraw al them that they\nrecountre in theire way / and they haue slayn the kyng\nof Danette your cousyn, and theire cry is \"Lusynen!\"'\nWhan the saudan vndersto&dtail; it he made hys trompettes\nto blow vp, that euery man shul&dtail; be arme&dtail;.  And\nthenne the saudan & x. M l sarasyns with hym went\nafter.  And geffray went with hys peple thrugh thoost\nmakyng grete occyson of sarasyns, For they were\nvnarmed, & might not endure nor withstan&dtail;.  And\nwete it that or euer they departed fro thoost, they\nslough & hurt more than iii M l sarasyns / and whan\nthey were out of the lodgys, they went al softe &\nfayre / And the sawdan of Damaske hasted hym after. Moche dolaunt & angry was the saudan of Damaske,\nwhan he perceyued the grete occyson that the\ncrysten had don vpon hys peuple / & sware by hys\ngoddes Appolyn an&dtail; mahon, that forthwith he shuld\nbe auenged on them, & that not a crysten shuld be\ntake to mercy, but shuld al be slayn.  thenne he\nfolowed geffray with x thousand Sarasyns.  And\nthenne geffray that perceyued, & sent wor&dtail; therof to hys bretheren by his peple feynyn&gtee; to flee / and he\nentre&dtail; within the busshe where his peple was, for to\nputte them in aray / And the saudan folowed alway,\n& passe&dtail; byfore thembuss&hbar;.  Wete it wel that the\nmaister of Rodes that conduyted the vanwar&dtail; was\nthenne in fayre batay&llbar;.  And whan he sawe the\nsaudan that folowed the crysten / he ranne ayenst the\nsarasyns, the spere in the rest, and there they medle&dtail;\ntogidre & faught strongly / and within a lytel space of\ntyme the Sarasyns were dyscomfyte.  For at the first\nrecountre with the speerys, eche cristen ouerthrew a\nsarasyn to the ert&hbar;.  And whan the sawdan sawe\nthat he might no lenger withstan&dtail; he reculed, &\nassembled his peple in hys best wyse, abydyng the\nsarasyns that came after.  But geffray & hys\ncompanye yssued out of thembusshe and ranne vpon them\n\u00feat went without ordonaunce after the saudan.  And\nwithin a whyle there were slayn of the sarasyns by the\nway more than foure thousan&dtail;.  And thenne many of\nthem fledd toward theire oost, and fon&dtail; the caliphe of\nbandas, the saudan of barbarye, the king Anthenor, &\nthadmyral of Cordes, whiche asked them fro whens\n\u00feey came / And they ansuer&dtail;: 'we come fro the\nbatay&llbar; where the sawdan of Damaske hath be\ndyscomfyted.'  And whan they vndersto&dtail; it they were\ndyscomforted & sorowful, & wyst not what they shuld\nsay or do.  Now I wyl retourne to speke of the batay&llbar;. The batay&llbar; was horrible & cruel, & the sawdan of\nDamaske faught manfully \u00feat day, after that he\nha&dtail; assembled hys peple.  Thenne came geffray, that\nranne vpon them at backsyde / and the maister of\nrodes at the other syde, In so moche that there was\nmade grete occysyon of sarasyns.  What shuld I make\nlong compte / the feled them assaylled on bothe sydes,\nwherby they were dyscomfyted, & might no lenger\ndefende.  And whan the saudan perceyued the\ndyscomfyture, he went out of the batay&llbar; & tourned the\ntarge behyn&dtail;, and sporyd hys hors, & fled fast toward\nthoost of the sarasyns / and geffray was at that syde,\nthat wel perceyued hym, & demed wel by hys ryche\narmures that it was he, or some grete lord of the\nsarasyns.  Thenne he broched hys hors with the sporys\nafter the saudan, and cryed to hym, 'retourne, or thou\nshalt dey!  For I shul&dtail; haue grete vergoyne yf I smote\nthe behyn&dtail; / but alwayes, yf thou not retourne, nedes\nI most do soo.'  And whan the sawdan vndersto&dtail;\nhym, he sporyd hys hors, & hasted hym more than he\ndide tofore / and geffray, that ryght dolaunt was that\nhe might not ouertake hym, cryed to hym ayen,\nsayen&gtee;: 'Fy on the! recreaunt coward; that art so\nwel horsed, & so nobly & surely armed, and yet darest\nnot abyde a man alone / retourne, or I shal slee the\nfleeyn&gtee; / how be it, that shal be ayenst my\nwy&llbar;.'  And thenne the saudan, vergoynous of geffrays wordes,\nthat for fere of a man alone he fledd / retourned at\nthe corner of \u00fee wode, nygh by thoost of the sarasyns,\nin that same place where as geffray had that day\nembusshed hys peuple / and putte hys shil&dtail; tofore hys\nbrest, and the spere in the rest, & thus he cryed to\ngeffray: 'What art thou, \u00feat so hastly folowest me /\nby mahon! that shal be to thy grete\ndommage.'/ 'and for thy prouffyt I am not come thus ferre,' said\ngeffray / 'but syth that myn name thou axest, thou\nshalt it knowe.  I am Geffray with the grete toeth,\nbro\u00feer to the kinges Vryan & guyon / and what art\nthou?'  'By mahon,' said the saudan, 'that shalt thou\nknowe / I am the saudan of Damaske.  And knowe\nthou, that I were not so joyous who that had gyuen me\na C thousan&dtail; besans of gol&dtail;, as I am to haue fon&dtail; the\nso at myn ease, For thou mayst me not escape / I deffy\nthe, by machomet my god.'  'By my feyth,' said\nGeffray, 'nother thou nor thy god I preyse not a rotyn dogge; For soone thou shalt fyn&dtail; me nerer the,\nto thyn euyl helthe / and yf it playse\u00fe to god, my\ncreatour, thou shalt not escape.' / Here sayth thystorye, that Geffray & the saudan,\nthat bothe were of grete courage & strengt&hbar;,\nreculed eche  fro other, and syn ranne vpon eche other /\nand the Saudan valyauntly smote geffray, & tronchoned\nhis spere vpon his shild / but it is wel to byleue that\nthe noble & valyaunt geffray, at this first cours, faylled\nnot; For he smote the Saudan by suche radeur, that he\nlefte hym out of hys arsouns, & bare hym vnto\ntherthe.  and so passed foorth, and immedyatly toke in hys han&dtail;\nhys good swer&dtail; / and pretendyng that men shul&dtail; speke\nof his fayttes & valyaunces, he smote the saudan by\nsuche vertu that he perced hys helmet, and effoundred\nhys heed almost to the brayne, so that the sawdan was\nsore astonyed and euyl besta&dtail;, in suche wyse that he\nnother sawe nor her&dtail; / but as geffray wol&dtail; haue\nalyghte&dtail; to haue take the saudans helmet, to haue\nbrought it to hys bretheren, & to see yf he was deed,\nhe perceyued wel thre score sarasyns, that cryed after\nhym, & said: 'By my lawe, false crysten, your ende\nis come.'  And whan geffray vnderstode it, he sporyd\nhys hors, & brandysshed the swer&dtail;; and the fyrst that\nhe recountre&dtail;, he smote doun to therthe al dee&dtail;.  And\nwho that had be there, he had seen hym execute noble\nfaytes & armes, as of one man deffendyng hys lyf; For\ngeffray cutte and smote of heedes & armes, and dyed\nthe place with grete effusyon of sarasyns bloo&dtail; / and\nthey casted at hym sperys & dartes, and made grete\npeyne for to haue had ouerthrawen hym to\nthert&hbar;.  And thenne the saudan was come at hymself ayen,\nand stode vp al astonyed, as he had come fro slepe /\nhe loke at ryght syde of hym, and mounted on hys\nhors, & sawe the batay&llbar;, where he perceyued wel\ngeffray, that made grete occysyon of sarasyns / and was geffray wounded & hurt in many places of his\nbody.  Thenne cryed the saudan, admonnestyn&gtee; his peple,\nsayeng / 'auaunt! worthy sarasyns / by mahomi&dtail;, yf\nhe vs escape, I shal neuer haue joye; For who might\nbryng hym to an euyl ende, the resydu were not to be\ndoubted.'  Thenne was geffray assaylle&dtail; on a&llbar; partes /\n& he deffended hym hardyly & so valyauntly, that no\nsarasyn durste hym abyde / but casted at hym fro ferre\nsperys, darts, stones & arowes / vyretons & quarelles,\nwith theire crosbowes / but it semed not that he made\nony force therof / but as a hongre wolf renneth vpon\nsheep / so dide he renne vpon the enemyes of\ngod.  'By my goddes, Appolyn & mahon,' sayd thenne the\nsaudan / 'this is not a man / but it is a grete dyue&llbar;,\ncome out of he&llbar; / or the Cristen god, whic&hbar; is come\nhither to distroye our lawe' / And, For certayn, geffray\nwas in this auenture wel by the space of two heures. In this parel was geffray vnto tyme that the new\nknight, whic&hbar; had be with hym in garende, which\nhad sene hym departe after the saudan / cam at him\nwith wel a C men of armes, For he loued hym\nentierly.  And thenne, whan he approched the wode, he perceyued\nthe batay&llbar;, and sawe the sawdan, that dyde his best\nfor to hurt & dommage Geffray, that faught alone\nayenst mahondys peuple; wherfore he said / 'cursed\nbe he of god, that shal not helpe hym now' / and the\nknightes peple ansuer&dtail;, 'to theire euyl helthe they\nhaue recountred geffray.'  And forthwith they broched\ntheire horses with theire sporys, & came to the\nbatay&llbar;.  but assoone as the saudan perceyued the\nsocours, he sporyd hys hors, & hastly fled toward\nthoost / & left his peple in that plyght, of the whic&hbar;\nneuer one escaped, but were al slayne.  Thenne whan\ngeffray perceyued the new knight, that so wel had\nsocoured hym, he thanked hym moche, & sayd: 'My\nfrend, suche rooses ben good, & of swete odour / & the lorde that hat about hym suche cheualrye, may take\nhis rest surely.'  'Sire,' said the knight, 'I haue not\ndoo that thin&gtee; wherof I owe to be rewarded, For\neuery trew seruaunt oweth to take heede to thonour &\nprouffyt of hys maister and lor&dtail;.  And thenne, syth it\nis soo / no reward ought not to be had therfore / but\ndeparte we hens, For it is tyme that ye take your rest:\nye haue do this day that wel may suffyse.  & also we\nbe lytel nombre of peuple, & nygh our enemyes, that\nhaue grete puyssaunce / and your woundes and soores\nmust be vysyted and ouersene / and also, it me semeth\nbest, that we retourne toward oure oost by our owne\nwy&llbar; / than yf by force we were constrayned to\nretourne; For no doubte / who that retourneth fleeyng,\n& is chassed by hys enemyes / that may be to hym but\nblame / how be it, that oftyme it is said / that bettre\nit is to flee, \u00fean to abyde a folyss&hbar; enterpryse.'  Thenne\nsaid geffray: 'Fayre sire, at this tyme we shal byleue\nyour counsey&llbar;.'  And they thenne departed, and went\ntoward theire oost, & fon&dtail; in theire way the feldes\nsowen with sarasyns deed.  And wete it wel, that\nthe same day, byfore none, the sarasyns lost wel xxv ti thousan&dtail; men, that by fayt of armes were al slayne /\nand there escape&dtail;, fleeyng, XL. M l .  And wete it\nalso, that the Caliphe and the two saudans, the kin&gtee;\nAnthenor and thadmyral of Cordes fon&dtail; of seuen score\nthousan&dtail; panemes that the euen tofore were in theire\noost, but foure score thousand, wherof they were gretly\nabasshe&dtail;.  Now I shal speke of Geffray, that was\nretourned to thoost, where he was wel festye&dtail; of hys\nbretheren, and of theire baronye / and his woundes\nwere vysyted by the Cyrurgyens, that said that he\nshuld not leue the harneys therfor: and they all\nthanked god.  And now I shal shew of the sawdan. / Thystorye sayth, that whan the saudan was departed\nfro the batay&llbar;, he walape&dtail; tyl he came to the sarasyns oost, where as he fon&dtail;, his peple al abasshed,\nFor they wend he had be slayn.  And whan they sawe\nhym, they made grete joye, & made to hym theire\nobeyssaunce, and asked how he had exployted.  'By\nmahomi&dtail;,' sayd \u00fee saudan / 'lytel or nought haue I\ndoo, For my peple is al deed.'  And incontynent he\nwas desarmed, & recounted them al thauenture.  And\nthe two oostes rested them that night, without ony\napproching or cours don of neyther partye. / Here sheweth thystorye, that on the morow by\ntymes, the Crysten armed them, & rengi&dtail; &\nordeyned them in batay&llbar;, and lefte good watche for to\nkepe theire lodgys / and them that were wounded &\nhurt, that myght bere no harneys / and marched foorth\nin fayre ordynaunce toward thenemyes.  In the\nvanwardes were geffray, & the maister of rodes, & theire\npeple; & goo&dtail; arblasters were vpon the wynges, wel\nrengi&dtail;.  And in the grete batay&llbar; was the king Vryan /\nand the king Guyon conduyted the ryergar&dtail; / and so\nlong they marched, that they sawe thoost of the\nsarasyns / And anoone was made thenne, on bothe\nsydes, a meruayllous cry / with whiche they marched\nthat one ayenst that other.  And bygan the batay&llbar; by\nthe archers and arblasters so aspre that thayer was\nobscuri&dtail; with the quarelles & arowes, that flewh so\nthy&ktee;. The valyaunt geffray was in the Formest\nfrount of his peuple, and whan the shotte seaced, he\ntoke his sheld & hys spere in escryeng 'Lusynen' by\nthre tymes, and smote his hors with his sporys, &\nthreste&dtail; in to myddes of his enemys so swyftly that\nthe maister of Rodes coude not folowe hym.  Ther was\nthenne horryble bruyt with theire cryes / that one\ncryed 'Damaske' / that other / 'barbarye' / some\ncryed 'bandas,' & some 'anthioche,' and other were\nthat cryed 'cordes' / and geffray & his peple cryed\n'Lusynen & Rodes.'  There made the thre bretheren so meruayllous faytes of armes / that not only the\nsarasyns were abasshed / but also the crystens merueylled\ntherof.  The saudans of Damaske, & of barbarye,\nperceyued the thre bretheren, that so ouerthrew & slew\ntheire peple; wherfore they, with xx. M l . sarasyns,\ncouched theire sperys & rane vpon them.  There\nreforced the batay&llbar; / and with that cours the cristen\nthe lengthe of a spere ferre.  And whan the thre\nbretheren saw the sarasyns, that thus ouerane theire\npeple / bygan to crye 'Lusynen,' & said, admounestyng\ntheire peple / 'auaunt, lordes barons! these dogges\nmay not lon&gtee; withstand our armes.'  And thenne the\nCristen toke herte corageous, & vygourously made an\nhorryble cours vpon theire enemys; wherby the stour\nwas strong, & the batay&llbar; mortal, For they ouerthrew\n& slough many sarasyns.  Thenne was \u00feer Geffray,\nthat effoundred heedes vnto the brayne, & smote doun\nto therthe al that he recountred with his swer&dtail;;\nWhiche perceyued thadmyral of Cordes, that smote on\nthe Cristen.  Thenne thrested geffray thrugh the prees,\n& cam and smote thadmyral by suche vertu, that he\nbrake bothe helmet & heed vnto the brayne.  There\nwas the prees grete, For ther came the two saudants\nand theire puyssaunce, that supposed wel to haue\nredressed thadmyra&llbar; vpon his hors / but it was for\nnought, For he was deed.  Thenne came there Vryan,\nand sawe the saudan of barbarye, \u00feat moche hated\nhym, for cause that he had slayn the saudan his vncle\nin Cypre.  Thenne came Vryan, & smote hym by\nsuche strengthe, that he made hys lyft arme to flee fro\nthe body.  And whan the saudan sawe hym thus\narayed, he went out of the batay&llbar;, & made ten knightes\nto conduyte hym to damaske / and neuertheles faught\neuer the sarasyns, For the saudan of damaske, & the\ncaliphe of bandas, & the king anthenor held them in vertu.  There was grete doleur, & grete\npestylence.  And wete it wel, that the Cristens were sore dommaged /\nbut as the veray cronykle sayth, the sarasyns receyued\nthere ouergrete dommage & loose, For of them were\nslayn XL. M l & more / and dured the batay&llbar; vnto\neuen tyme, that they withdrew them eyther other part\nto theire lodgyses.  And on the morne the Caliphe, &\nthe kin&gtee; anthenor, & the residu of theire peuple,\nwithdrew them in to the Cite of Damaske.  And whan the\nthre bretheren vndersto&dtail; it, they went & lodged, with\ntheire puyssaunce, tofore Damaske.  And wete it wel,\nthey were gretly febled, & the more part of them\nhurt.  And there they rested them by the space of VIII dayes, without sawtyng ne scarmysshing. Thystorye sheweth vnto vs that the kyng Vryan\nand hys bretheren and the maister of Rodes were\nryght dolaunt & wroth for the grete losse of theire\npeple.  For wel they sawe that yf the sarasyns assembled new\nmen, it myght come therof some euyl to them.  For\nwel they had lost viii Ml of theire men.  But at that\nother part were the saudans al abasshe&dtail;.  For they\nknew not the dommage that the Crysten had\nreceyued.  And they had Counsey&llbar; that they shuld requyre kyng\nVryan journey of traytye vpon fourme of peas / and so\nthey dide / And the kyng hadd counsey&llbar; that he shuld\nbe greable to it.  And the iourney was assygned by\nthaccorde of bothe partes on the iii de day atwix the\nlodgys & the toun / and were the trews graunted &\nwere delyuere&dtail; good pledges & hostages of both\npartyes.  And thenne came they of the toun to selle theire\nmarchaundyse in to the Crystens oost.  Thenne came\nto the iourney of traytye that was assigned the saudants\nand theire Counsey&llbar;.  And of the other part came\nVryan & hys bretheren, the maister of Rodes & theire\nbaronye with them, and spake, & communyked togidre\nof one thinge & of other, / and dede so moch of eyther partye that they were accorded, and pacyfyed by\ncondycion that the Sarasyns shuld restore to the lordes\nCristen a&llbar; theire expenses & costes made in their vyage,\n& to paye yerly vnto kyng Vryan & hys heyres for\neuermore xxx Ml besauns of gol&dtail; / and trews were made\nbetwene them for one hundred & one yere, and therof were\nletres patentes sealled.  And this couuenaunt and\ntrayte the sawdan of Barbarye that great doleur felt in\nhys sholder for hys arme that was of / and the kyn&gtee;\nof Anthioche / ratyfyed, / promyttyng that neuer they\nshuld bere armes ayenst king Vryan, / ayenst Guyon of\nArmanye nor ayenst the maister of Rodes, nor theire\npeple / and that yf other kynges or prynces sarasyns\nwold attempte ony werre anenst them, they shuld lete\nthem haue knowleche therof assoone as they might\nknow it / and yf thrugh that cause they had werre\nayenst ony kin&gtee; or prynce, Vryan promysed them to\nsocoure and gyue them comfort with a&llbar; hys power, / &\nin lyke wyse kyn&gtee; Guyon & the maister of Rodes\npromysed to them / And soone after the thre bre\u00feern\nand theire peple retourned to the port of Japhe.  And\nthe saudan of Damaske, the Calyphe of bandas, & the\nkynge Anthenor conueyed hym thither.  And the\nsawdan made moche of Geffray, and proffre&dtail; hym grete\nyeftes, but he wold nought receyue / but that he moche\nthanked hym of his curtoysye. Thystorye sayth that Vryan & Guyon entred in to\nthe see, & vowed themself to\nJherusalem.  Wherfore they toke leue of geffray theire bro\u00feer, and hym\nmoche thanked of hys noble ayde & socours / and syn\nthey departed fro the porte of Japhe, and rowe&dtail; toward\nJherusalem.  And Geffray toke hys way by the see\ntoward Rochelle, & saylled so long that he came there\nwhere as he was honourably receyued & gretly festyed. /\nAnd on the morn he departed, and rode with hys\ncompanye tyl he ca&mmacr;e to Merment, where he fon&dtail; bothe his fader & and his moder, that knew tofore how he &\nhis brethern had wrought beyon&dtail; the grete see &\nfestyed hym gretly / raymondyn hys fader kept a grete\nfeste & grete Court for joy that he had of his\ncommyng.  But soone aftir came there tydynges that in the\nCountre of the Garende was a grete geaunt that by hys\ngrete pryde & orguey&llbar;, & by his grete strengt&hbar; hel&dtail; a&llbar;\nthe Countre in subgection.  For no man durst gaynsay\nhis commandement.  Of these tydynges was Raymondin\nryght dolaunt; how be it he made of it no semblaunt,\nferyn&gtee; that geffray shuld knowe & here of it.  For he\nknew hym of so grete courage that he wol&dtail; goo fyght\nwith the geaunt yf he vndersto&dtail; where he was.  But\nit might not be kept so secret but that geffray\nvnderstode \u00fee talkyng of hym / and that come to hys\nknowlege / he sayd in this wyse / 'how dyuel my\nbretheren and I haue subdued & made trybutary the\nsaudan of damask & hys complyces, and that houn&dtail;\nalone shal be suffred to hold my faders ryght\nenherytaunce in subgection / by my sowle, in his euyl helthe\nhe thought to vsurpe it, For it shal cost hym hys lyf yf\nI may.'  Thenne came Geffray to hys fader, & thus\nsaid to hym.  'My lord, I meruey&llbar; of you that are a\nknight of so noble enterpryse how ye haue suffred so\nlon&gtee; of that hound Guedon the geaunt, that hath putte\nyour countre of garande in subgection / by god, my\nlord, shame is therof to you.'  Whan raymondin\nvndersto&dtail; hym, he said / 'Geffray, fayre sone, wete it is not\nlong syn we knowe therof / & that we haue suffred\nvnto your joyful commyng.  For we wold not trouble\nthe fest / but doubte you not, guedon shal haue hys\npayment after his deserte.  He slew my granfader in\nthe Counte of pouthieu, as it was told me in bretayn,\nwhan I went thither for to fyght with Olyuer, sone to\nJosselyn, that betrayed my fader.' / Thanne ansuer&dtail; Geffray: 'I ne wot nor wyl not\nenquyre of thinges past, syth that my predecessours\nhaue therof had thonour & are come to theire aboue /\nbut at this tyme present that Iniurye shal be soone\nmended yf it plese god & I may / and as touching your\npersonne ye ought not to meue your self for suche a\ntheef & palyard; For I, with ten knightes of myn\nhoushol&dtail; only for to hold me companye / not for ayde\nthat I wyl haue of them ayenst hym, I shal goo fyght\nwith hym' / And whan Raymondyn hys fader\nvndersto&dtail; hys wordes he was dolaunt & sorowful, and thus\nsaid to hym / 'sethen it may none other wyse be / goo\nthou by the grace of god.'  And thenne geffray toke\nhis leue of his fader & of hys moder, and putte hym\nself on the way toward garande accompanyed with x\nknightes, and there where he passed by he enquyre&dtail;\nafter guedon where he might fyn&dtail; hym / And wel it\nis trouth that it was tol&dtail; hym where the geaunt was /\nBut men were meruaylle&dtail;, & asked of geffray why he\nsperyd after hym.  'By my feyth,' ansuerde geffray,\n'I bryng hym the trybut & payment that he by his\nfoly & oultrage thaketh vpon my faders lordship / but\nit is neyther gol&dtail; ne syluer / but it is only the poynte\nof my spereheed, For none other payment he shal\nreceyue of me but strokes of my swer&dtail; withal.'  And\nwhan the good peple her&dtail; hym thus speke, they said\nto hym in this wyse: 'By my feyth, geffray, ye\nvndertake grete foly, For an hondred suche as ye be shul&dtail;\nnot be able to withstan&dtail; hys cruelte.'  'doubte you\nnot,' said geffray / 'but lete me haue the feer alone' /\nand they held theire peas, For they durst not make hym\nwroth.  For moche they fered hys fyersnes & yre, of\nwhiche he was replenysshed / but \u00feey conduyted hym\nvnto a leghe nygh to the say&dtail; geauntis retrette or\npryue dwellyn&gtee; / and \u00feene they sayd to geffray: 'Sire,\nye may lightly fyn&dtail; hym at yonder place within the forest' / and geffray ansuer&dtail;, 'I wol&dtail; fayne see hym,\nFor to fyn&dtail; hym I am come hither' / And here\ncesseth thystorye to speke of geffray / and sheweth of\nRaymondyn & of Melusyne. / The veray and trew hystorye witnesseth that\nRaymondin & Melusyne were at merment making\ngrete joye for the prosperous estate & good Fortune of\ntheire children; but this joye was soon tourned to\ngrete sorowe, For as ye haue her&dtail; how thystorye saith\ntofore that Raymondin promysed to Melusyne that\nneuer on the satirday he shuld not enquere of her nor\ndesyre to see her that day.  It is trouth that on a\nSatirday a lytel byfore dyner tyme, Raymondyn\nvnderstode that hys brother the Erle of Forests was come\nto Merment for to see hym & hys Noble Court.\nwherof Raymondin was ryght Joyous, but sith grete\nmyschief came to hym therfore as herafter shal be\nshewed.  Thenne made Raymondin grete apparay&llbar; &\nryght noble for to receyue his brother / And shortly to\nshewe, he came & recountred hys brother with noble\ncompany & welcommed hym honourably, & dide moche\nthat one of that other, & went to chircheward togidre /\nAnd after the deuyne seruice was don they came\nagayn to the palleys where al thinges were redy to\ndyner / they wesshe theire handes and syn sett them\nat dyner and \u00feey were worshipfully serued / ha /\nlas! thenne bygan a part of the doleur & heuynes.  For hys\nbrother coude not kepe hym, but he asked after\nMelusyne, sayeng in this manere: 'My brother, where is\nmy sustir Melusyne? lete her come, for moche I desyre\nto see her.'  And Raymondyn, whiche thought none\neuyl, ansuer&dtail;, 'she is not here at this tyme / but to\nmorne ye shal see her & shal make you good\nchere.'  But for that ansuere the Erle of Forests held not hys\npeas / but thus sai&dtail; ayen to his brother: 'Ye are my\nbrother / I owe not to hyde to you your dyshonour. Now, fayre brother, wete it that the commyn talking of\nthe peple is, that Melusyne your wyf euery satirday in\nthe yere is with another man in auoultyre / & so blynd\nye are by her sayen&gtee; that ye dare not enquere nor\nknoweth wher she becommeth or gooth / and also other\nsayen, & make them stron&gtee; that she is a spyryte of the\nfayry, that on euery satirday maketh hir penaunce.  I\nwot not to whiche of bothe I shal byleue / and for\nnone other cause I am come hither but to aduertyse\nyou therof.'  Whan Raymondin thenne vndersto&dtail; these\nwordes that his brother hym said he roos fro the table\nand entred in to his chambre, and anoone a&llbar; esprysed\nwith yre & Jalousy, witha&llbar; toke hys swer&dtail; & girded\nit about hym, & syn went toward the place where as\nMelusyne went euery satirday in the yer / and whan\nhe cam there he fon&dtail; a doore of yron thikk & strong /\nand wete it wel he had neuer be tofore that tyme so\nferre thitherward / and whan he perceyued the doore\nof yron he toke hys swer&dtail;, that was har&dtail; & tempered\nwith fyn stele, and with the poynte of it dyde so moche\nthat he perced the doore, and made a ho&llbar; in it, and\nloked in at that ho&llbar;, and sawe thenne Melusyne that\nwas within a grete bathe of marbel stone, where were\nsteppis to mounte in it, and was wel xv foot of lengt&hbar;;\nand therin she bathed herself, makyng there her\npenytence as ye shal here herafter. /", "37": "Cap. XXXVII. Here aftir foloweth how Raymondin by the admounesting of hys brother beheld Melusyne hys wyf within the bathe, wherfor he toke hys brother the Erle of Forest in grete indignacion. Thystorye sayth in this partye that Raymondin\nstode so long at the yron doore that he perced it\nwith the poynte of his swerd, wherby he might wel see a&llbar; that was within the Chambre / and sawe melusyne\nwithin the bathe vnto her naue&llbar;, in fourme of a woman\nkymbyng her heere, and fro the nauel dounward in\nlyknes of a grete serpent, the tay&llbar; as grete & thykk as\na bare&llbar;, and so long it was that she made it to touche\noftymes, while that raymondyn behel&dtail; her, the rouf of\nthe chambre that was ryght hye.  And whan\nRaymondyn perceyued it, wete it wel that he was ryght\ndolaunt and sorowful & not without cause, and coude\nneuer hold hys tonge but he said, 'My swete loue, now\nhaue I betraye&dtail; you, & haue falsed my couenaunt by\nthe ryght fals admounestyng of my brother, and haue\nforsworne myself towar&dtail; you.'  Raymondin thenne was\nsmyten to the herte with suche sorow & dystresse that\nvnnethe he coude speke / and pensefu&llbar; with a heuy\ncontenaunce retourned hastly towar&dtail; hys chambre, and\ntoke some wax wherwith he went & stopped the ho&llbar;\nthat he had made at the doore of yron, and syn came\nagayn to the ha&llbar; where he foun&dtail; hys brother.  And\nthenne whan therle of Forest perceyued hym and sawe\nhys heuy contenaunce / wel supposed he that he had\nfon&dtail; Melusyne in some shamful fayt, and said to him\nin this wyse: 'My brother, I wyst it wel / haue ye not\nfon&dtail; as I sai&dtail;?'  Thenne cryed Raymondin to hys\nbrother of Forest in this manyere: 'Voyde this place\nfals traytour, For thrugh your fals reporte I haue falsed\nmy feyth ayenst the moost feythfullest & truest lady\nthat euer was borne.  ye are cause of the losse of al my\nworldly joye & of my tota&llbar; destruction / by god, yf I\nbyleued my courage, I shuld make you to dey now of\nan euyl deth / but rayson naturel kepeth & deffendeth\nme therfro, bycause that ye are my brother / goo your\nway & voyde my syght, that al the grete maisters of he&llbar; may conduyte you thither' / And whan the\nErle of Forest apperceyued Ramondyn his brother\nthat was in so grete yre, he went out of the halle & a&llbar;\nhis peple, & mounted on horsbak and rode as fast as\nthey might toward Forests ryght pensefu&llbar; & heuy,\nrepentyng hym of hys folyss&hbar; enterpryse; for he knew\nwel that Raymondin his brother wold neuer loue hym\nnor see hym.

Here sayeth thistorye, that in suche doleur &\nbeway&llbar;inges abode raymondin al that nyght tyl it\nwas day light.  And as sone as aurora might be\nperceyued, Melusyne came & entred in to the chambre /\nand whan Raymondyn her&dtail; her come he made\nsemblaunt of slepe.  She toke of her clothes, and than al\nnaked layed herself by hym.  And thenne bygan\nRaymondyn to sighe as he that felt grete doleur at herte /\nand Melusyne embraced hym, & asked what hym eyled,\nsayeng in this wyse: 'My lord, what eyleth you, be ye\nsyke?'  And whan Raymondin sawe that she of none\nother \u00fein&gtee; spake, he supposed that she nothing had\nknowen of this faytte / but for nought he byleued soo,\nFor she wyst wel that he had not entame&dtail; nor shewed\nthe matere to no man / Wherfor she suffred at that\ntyme & made no semblaunt therof / wherfore he was\nright Joyous, and ansuer&dtail; to her: 'Madame, I haue be\nsomewhat euyl at ease & haue had an axez in maner\nof a contynue.'  'My lord,' said Melusyne, 'abasshe you\nnot, For yf it plese god ye shal soone be hole.'  And\nthenne he that was right joyous sai&dtail; to her, 'By my\nfeyth, swete loue, I fele me wel at ease for your\ncommyng' / and she said, 'I am \u00feerof glad' / and\nwhan tyme requyred they roos and went to here masse /\nand soone after was the dyner redy / and thus abode\nMelusyne with Raymondyn al that day / and on the\nmorne she toke leue of hym & went to Nyort, where\nshe bylded a fortresse. And here seaceth thistorye of\nher / and retourneth to speke of geffray. Here sayth thystory, that Geffray came in garande,\nwhere as he was receyue&dtail; with gret joye / and\nhe asked where the geant guedon hel&dtail; hym self / and,\nas before is said, they conduyted hym, and shewed to\nhym the strong tour of Mermount, where the geaunt\nwas, & said: 'Sire, wete it / that yf ye byleue vs, it\nshal suffyse you to haue sene the toure, & shal retourne\nwith vs; For as touching our personnes, we shal goo\nno neer \u00feat horryble geaunt, algaf you to eyther of vs\nyour pesaunt or weyght fyn gold.'  'By my feyth,\nsires,' said geffray, 'I thanke you moche, that thus ferre\nye haue brought me.' Geffray thenne, as thystory saith, descendi&dtail; from\nhis hors, & armed hym, and syn girded hys\nswerd about hym, & remounted on horsback; and\nafter toke hys shel&dtail;, & heng it tofore hys brest; &\ntoke a clubbe of stele, & faste it at tharsons of his\nsade&llbar;; and syn toke a trompe of yuory, and heng\nit at hys neck behyn&dtail; and syn aske&dtail; hys spere /\nand thenne said to his tene knightes, in this manere:\n'Fayre lordes, abyde me in this valey / and yf god\ngraunte me the vyctory of the geaunt, I shal thenne\nblowe this horne / and whan ye shal here it, ye shal\nlyghtly come to me.'  And they were dolaunt that he\nwold not suffre them to go with hym, and bade hym\nfarwe&llbar;, prayeng god for hys good spede.  Thenne\ndeparted the valyaunt & hardy geffray, and mounted\nthe montayne; and anoone cam to the first gate of the\ntoure, & foun&dtail; it open / thenne entred he in to the\nbassecourt, & went towar&dtail; the dongeon, that stron&gtee;\nwas to meruay&llbar;.  And whan he was nygh, he beheld\nit, & moche playsed hym the facion and byldyng of\nhit; but he sawe the brydge, that was drawen vp.  For\nthe geante slepte.  Thenne he cryed with a hye voys,\nsayeng in this manere: 'hourys sone & fals geaunt, c&omacr;me speke with me!  For I bryng to the / the syluer\nthat the peuple of my lord, my fader, owen to\nthe.'  And, for certayn, geffray cryed so long that the geaunt\nawacke&dtail;, & came at a wyndowe, and beheld geffray,\narmed of al pyeces, mounted vpon a courser, that held\nhys spere couched / and thus bygan to crye, with a\nlowde voyce, 'knyght! what wold thou haue?'  'By\nmy sowle,' said geffray, 'I seke for the, & for none\nother / and I come hither to chalange the, and brin&gtee;\nwith me the trybut that thou hast ouersette vpon the\npeuple of my lord, Raymondyn of Lusynen, my\nfader.'  Thenne whan the geant vnderstode geffray, he was\nnygh aragid & ma&dtail;, that of one knight alone was so\nbold to make hym warre, & had sette hym so nygh hys\nplace. but, notwithstanding, when he ha&dtail; wel aduysed\nhym, he consydered in hym self that he was a man of\ngrete valyaunce.  Thenne the geaunt armed hymself,\nand laced the taches of hys helmet; & toke a grete\nbarre of yron, and a grete sythe of stele, & came to\nthe brydge, and lete it fa&llbar;; & came in the bassecourt,\n& demanded of geffray: 'What art thou, knight, that\nart so bold to come hither?'  And geffray ansuer&dtail;, in\nthis manere: 'I am geffray with the grete toeth, sone\nto Raymondyn of Lusynen, that commeth hither to\nchalenge the patiz or trybut, that thou takest thrugh\nthy grete pryde, of my lord my faders peple.'  Thenne\nwhan Guedon vnderstod it, he bygan to lawhe, and to\nhym thus said: 'By my feyth, poure fole, for thy grete\nhardynes & the grete enterprise of thyn herte, I haue\npyte of the.

Thenne whan geffray with the grete\ntoth her&dtail; that the geaunt made so lytel of hym, & that\nas nought he preysed hym, he was of it ryght dolaunt,\nand said to hym in this wyse: 'Meschaunt creature,\nthou alredy ferest me moc&hbar; / I wyl wel thou wete that\nof thy curtoysy I sett nought by, For thus spekest thou\nfor the grete feer that thou hast of my toeth.  but wete\n\u00feou, for certayn, that I shal neuer departe fro this place\nvnto that tyme I haue separed the lyf fro thy body /\nand therfor, haue pyte of thyself, & not of me, For I\nhold the for deed where as thou art / & ryght foorth I\ndeffye ye.'  And whan the geaunt her&dtail; hym, he made\nsemblaunt of lawghin&gtee;, sayeng al this: 'Geffray, fool,\nthou commest in to batay&llbar;, & thou mayst not endure\none stroke of me only, without I felle the to \u00fee\nerthe.'  And thenne geffray, without ony more sayen&gtee;, smote\nhys hors with hys sporys, and charged hys spere, &\ndressed hym toward the geaunt, asmoche as the hors\nmight ranne; and strak hym thrugh the brest by suche\nstrengt&hbar; that he bare hym to the groun&dtail;, the bely\nvpwar&dtail;. but the geaunt stert vp lyghtly, in grete\nyre, & as geffray passed by, he smote hys hors behyn&dtail;\nwith hys sythe of fyn stele / and whan geffray wyst\nit, he descended lyghtly from hys hors, & came towar&dtail;\nthe geaunt, the swer&dtail; drawen.  and thenne came the\ngeaunt toward hym, holdin&gtee; his sythe in his han&dtail;:\nwhere as was grete batay&llbar;.", "38": "Cap.

How Froymond, brother to Geffray, was professed monke at Mayllezes, by consentement of hys fader & moder. Moche were thenne the knightes abasshe&dtail;, as\nthistorye reherceth, of this that geffray had\nslayn the geaunt, that was so grete & mighty.  And\nthe tydinges therof were spre&dtail; in the Countre, & in the\nmarches about.  And also geffray sent, by two of hys\nknightes, to hys fader, the heed of the geaunt.  And\nin the meane season he went & dysported hym in the\nCountre, where as he was gretly feste&dtail;, & receyued with grete joye, & presented with gret ryches.  Here I\nshal leue to speke of hym / & shal shew you of\nFroymond, hys brother, who that prayed so moche hys fader\nand his moder, that they were greable that he shuld be\nprofessed monke at Maylleses / & so he was shorne, by\nthe consentement of hys fader, & of his moder;\nWherof thabbot & a&llbar; conuent was ryght\njoyous.

And the heed was moche loked on / & euery man\nmeruaylled how geffray durst assay&llbar; hym.  And thenne\nRaymondin sent a lettre to geffray, how Froymon&dtail;, his\nbrother, was professed monke at thabbey of\nmaylleses.  helas!  that message was the cause of the trystefu&llbar;\ndoleur of the departyng of his wyf, wherof neuer\nafter he nor she had hertly joye, as ye shal here\nherafter.

'By my feyth, my lord,' said the messager, 'it is\ntrouth that I telle you; &, morouer, your son\nFroymond is brent & deed with them / and yf ye byleue\nme not make me to be putte in to pryson, & yf ye\nfynde otherwyse than I saye, lete me be hanged\ntherfore.'  Thenne Raymondyn sorowfu&llbar; & heuy mounte&dtail;\nfoorthwith on horsbak, & toke hys way toward\nmaylleses as fast as hys hors myght bere hym / and hys\nmen, who \u00feat myght folowed hym / and he neuer\nseaced tyl he cam thither / where he fonde, as the\nmessager said, & sawe the grete doleur & myschief that\ngeffray had don.  Wherof he toke suche yre & anger\nat herte, that almost he was out of hys wyt.  'ha / a,'\nsayd he, 'Geffray, thou haddest the fayrest begynnyng\nof hye prowes & cheualrye to haue come to the degree\nof high honour more than ony prynce son lyuyng at\nthis day / and now thrugh thy grete cruelte thou shalt\nbe reputed & holden vnworthy of al noble fayttes, &\nabhomyned for cause of thys vnkyndnes & horryble\ndede of al creatures.  By the feyth that I owe to god,\nI byleue it is but fantosme or spyryt werke of this\nwoman / and as I trowe she neuer bare no child that\nshal at thende haue perfection, For yet hath she\nbrought none but that it hath some strange token / see\nI not the horryblenes of her son called Horryble, that\npassed not vii yere of age whan he slew two squyers of\nmyn / and or euer he was thre yere old he made dye\ntwo gentyl women his nourryces, thrugh hys byttyng of\ntheire pappes? / sawe I not also theyre moder of that\nsatirday, whan my brother of Forestz to me brought\neuyl tydynges of her / in fourme of a serpent fro the\nnauel dounwar&dtail;? / by god, ye / and wel I wote certayn /\nit is som spyryt, som fantosme or Illusyon that thus\nhath abused me / For the first tyme that I sawe her /\nshe knew & coude reherce a&llbar; my fortune & auenture.' In this partye, sayth thystorye, that Raymondyn,\npensefu&llbar; and wroth ouer meruayllously, departed\nfro Mayllezes, & rode agayn toward Merment.  And\nwhan he was come thither, he alyghted, & went in to\nhys chambre, where as he layed hym vpon a be&dtail; / and\nthere he made suche lamentacion, & so pyteous\nbewayllynges, that there nys in the world herte so harde / but\nthat it had wepte to here hym.  Thenne were al the\nbarons ryght dolaunt / and whan they sawe that they\nmyght not gyue none allegeance to hys dolour, they\ntoke Counsey&llbar; that they shuld lete it wete to theire\nlady Melusyne, whiche was at Nyort that tyme / and\nthither they sent a messanger, to recounte to her al the\nmatere of the fayt.  Halas!  fu&llbar; euyl dide they, For\nthey augmented thereby bothe Raymondyn & Melusyne\nin theyre douleur & myserye.  Now bygynneth theire\nhar&dtail; & bytter departyn&gtee;, eche fro other, whiche dured\nto Raymondyn his lyf natural / & to Melusyne shal\nlaste her penitence vnto domysday.  The messager\nthenne rode tyl he came to Nyort, & made his\nobeyssaunce, & syn delyuered the lettres to his lady: the whiche she toke, & opened it.  And whan she\nvnderstode the tenour of the lettres, she was ryght heuy\n& dolaunt, & more for the yre & wrath of Raymondin\nthan for ony other thin&gtee;; For she sawe wel that the\nmeschief that geffray had doon might none otherwyse\nbe as for that tyme present.  She thenne made come\na&llbar; her peuple & aray, and sent for many ladyes &\ndamoyselles, for to hold her companye / and so\ndeparted fro Nyort, & came to Lusynen / and there she\nsoiourned by the space of thre dayes / and euer she\nwas of symple & heuy contenaunce / and went al about\nin the place, vp & doun, here & there / gyuyng ofte\nsyghes so grete that it was meruaylle & pyteous to\nhere / And the hystory & cronykle, whiche I byleue\nbe trew, sheweth to vs that wel she knew the doleur & sorow that was nygh her to come / and as to me, I\nbyleue it fermely / but her peple thoughte nothing of\nthat / but they trowed that it had be for cause of the\ngrete myschief that was befe&llbar; thrugh the fayttes of\ngeffray, to thabbay of maylleses / and also for the\nwrathe & anger that Raymondyn toke\ntherof.  Melusyne thenne, on the III de day, departed fro Lusynen, &\ncame to merment wel acompanyed of ladyes &\ndamoyselles, as tofore I haue sayd.  And thenne the barons\nof the lan&dtail;, that were there assembled for to haue\nrecomforted Raymondin, that they loued entierly / came\nayenst her, & honourably receyued her / & sayd how\nthey by no wyse coude make Raymondyn to leue hys\ndolour.  'Wel,' sayd she / 'doubte you no; For, by\nthe grace of god, he shalbe soone recomforte&dtail;.' Melusyne, the good lady, that thenne was wel\nacompanyed of many ladyes & noble\ndamoyselles, & of the barons of the lan&dtail;, entred in to \u00fee\nChambre where as Raymondin was in / the whic&hbar;\nchambre had regarde towar&dtail; the gardyns, that were\ncommodyous & delectables, and also to the feldes\ntoward Lusynen.  Thenne whan she sawe Raymondin,\nhumbly & ryght honourably salued hym / but thenne\nhe was so dolaunt & replenysshed with yre, that he to\nher ansuer&dtail; neuer a wor&dtail; / and thenne she toke the\nwor&dtail;, & sayd: 'My lord, grete symplenes & foly it is\nto you that men repute & hold so sage & so wyse a\nprynce / you thus to maynten & make suche sorowe of\nthat thinge that may none other wyse be, & whiche\nmay not be amended nor remedyed / ye argue ayenst\nthe playsire & wy&llbar; of the Creatour, whiche a&llbar; thinges\ncreated, & shal vndoo at al tymes whan it playse hym,\nby suche manere wyse aftir his playsire.

And thenne was the deuyne\nseruyce doon, where Raymondyn offred ryche jewels\nas gol&dtail; and precyous stones.  And after the seruyce\nthey went to dyner / and raymondyn dyde doo sen&dtail;\nto hys bretheren hermytes besyde theire pytaunce other\nmeetes for recreacion, letyn&gtee; them knowe hys\nprofessyon & commyng.  Wherof al they lawded god,\ndeuoutely prayeng hym that he wold hold & encres\nRaymondyn in good deuocyon.  And so dwelled\nRaymondyn in thabbay, and on the morne he entred\nin to his Celle wher he bygan to le&dtail; a holy & strayt\nlyf.  And anoone after was the tydynges spred&dtail; thrugh a&llbar; Aragon & Langgedok how that a grete\nprynce was made hermyte at Mounferrat / but they\nknew not of what Countre he was.  And also he\nwol&dtail; neuer vttre it / And many noble men went to\nsee hym / and in especial the kin&gtee; of aragon was there\nhym self, whic&hbar; asked hym of his estate & Countre /\nbut of hym he coude neuer wete it.  And here resteth\nthystorye of them / and retourneth to shewe of\nRaymondyns men that departed fro Thoulouse. / Thystory recounteth that so long rode the men\nof Raymondyn after they were departed fro\nThoulouse that they came in Poytou & so foorth to\nLusynen, Where they fonde geffray and many of the\nbarons of the lan&dtail; / after theire obeyssaunce doon\nthey delyuered theire letres to geffray & to the barons\nas they were commanded by Raymondyn theire\nlor&dtail;.  Whan the baronye vndersto&dtail; the tenour of theire\nletres they said to geffray in this manere / 'My lord\nsyth it playseth not your fader vs more to gouerne /\nand that he wyl that we doo our hommage to you, we\nare al redy thereto.'  'By god,' said geffray, 'gramercy,\nFayre lordes, and I am redy to receyue you to your\nlygeauns.'  And \u00feenne they dyde to hym\nhommage.  And anoone after was knowen thrugh al the Countre\nhow Raymondyn had exilled hymself for the grete\nsorow that he had for his wyf Melusyne that he had\nlost.  Who thenne had sene the doleur & lamentable\nheuynes that men dide thrugh a&llbar; the Countre\nwysshyng theire lord & theire lady, he shul&dtail; haue had\nhertely pyte.  For many one fered geffray for cause of\nhis yre & fyersnes.  But for nought they doubted, For\nhe gouerne&dtail; hym rightously & wel.  Here I sha[l]\nleue of \u00feem to speke / and shal shewe of geffray that\nwas ryght dolaunt & sorowful of that he had lost bot&hbar;\nhys fader & his moder thrugh his owne mysdede &\nsynne.  For they that were retourned fro hym coude not say where he was come.  Thenne remorse of\nconscience toke geffray at herte & remembred how he\nfyred thabbaye of Maylleses, & brent hys brother\nFroymon&dtail; and al the monkes \u00feer without hauyng ony\nlawfu&llbar; cause so to doo / and that thrughe hys synne\nhe angred bothe hys fader & moder, and by that cause\nhe had lost his moder.  Wherfore he toke suche sorowe\nthat it was meruay&llbar; / and also he remembred the deth\nof the Erle of Forest hys vncle, whic&hbar; thrugh his faytte\nfell doun fro the hyest toure of the Castel Marcelly to\nthe erthe.  And thus remembred geffray a&llbar; hys\nmy[s]dedes and synnes, and sore wepyng bygan to say /\nthat but yf god had pyte on hym he was lyke to be\nlost & dampned for euer.  And thenne he hymself\nalone entred into a chambre / and there he bygan to\nmake grete sorowe & lamentable wepynges prayeng god\nwith herte contrite that he wold haue mercy on hym /\nand as god wold he toke there deuocion to goo to\nRomme for to confesse his synnes to our holy fader the\npope.  And thenne he sent for his broder theodoryke\nthat he shuld come to speke with hym, For he loued\nhym aboue al o\u00feer.  And assoone as Theodoryke\nvndersto&dtail; the mandement of hys brother geffray, he\nfoorthwith mounte&dtail; on horsback & rode tyl he came\nto Lusynen where geffray was, that receyue&dtail; hym\nwith joye, & said to hym that he wold leue al hys\nlan&dtail; in his gouernaunce, For he wold go to Romme to\nconfesse his synnes tofore the pope / & that he wol&dtail;\nneuer come ayen tyl he had foun&dtail; hys fader.  Thenne\nTheoderyk praye&dtail; hym that he wold suffre hym to goo\nwith hym.  And geffray shewed to hym that it were\nnot good for them bothe so to doo / And thenne\ngeffray with noble companye departed and toke with\nhym grete goodes, and toke with hym one of hys\nfaders seruaunts that was retourned fro Thoulouse for\nto conduyte hym a&llbar; that way that hys fader yede / and he shuld euer take hys lodgys there as hys fader\nwas lodged by the way.  And the seruaunt hym\nansuer&dtail; that gladly he shuld so doo.", "58": "Cap. LVIII. How Geffray went to Romme & confessed hys synnes tofore the Pope. Thystorye sayth that whan geffray was departed\nfro Lusynen he rode so long by hys journeyes\nthat he came to romme, and drew hym toward our\nholy fader the Pope, to whome he made humble\nreuerence and syn deuoutely confessed hym of hys\nsynnes.  And the Pope charged hym to make thabbay\nof Maylleses to be edyfyed agayn & therto ordeyne six\nscore monkes, & many other penitences the pope\ncharged hym doo, the whiche as now present I shal not\nshewe.  And thenne geffray said to our holy fader the\nPope how he wol&dtail; goo to seke hys fader, and the pope\ntold hym that he shul&dtail; fyn&dtail; hym at Mountferrat in\nAragon.  And thenne he toke leue of the pope &\nkysse&dtail; his feet / and the pope gaf hym hys\nbenediction.  And so geffray departed fro Romme & toke\nhys way toward toulouse where he cam & hys meyne\nwith hym and was lodged where as his fader dede\nlodge tofore.  And there the seruaunt aske&dtail; of theire\nhoste yf he coude not telle whic&hbar; way hys lord\nRaymondyn toke / And thoste said to hym that hys\nlord had hold the way toward Nerbonne & that no\nferther he knew of hys way.  And the seruaunt told\nit to geffray.  'By my feyth,' said geffray, 'that is\nnot the next way for to goo to Mountferrat / but syth\nmy fader went that way so shal we doo.'  And thus\non the morne geffray & hys meyne departed & hasted\nthem toward Nerbonne, where they cam & were lodged\nthere as Raymondyn had tofore lodged.  For so moche\nenquered the servaunt that he knewe \u00feat hys lord dide lodge there, & how he dide do make there many\nhabytes for an hermyte.  And on the morne geffray\ntoke hys way toward Parpynen, where he cam, & fro\n\u00feens he rode with hys meyne to Barselone, & \u00feenne to\nthabbey of mountferrat where he alyghted & sent hys\nhorses to Culbaston / and syn he yede & entred in to\nthe Chirc&hbar;.  And anoon the seruaunt beforsai&dtail; sawe\nthe Chappellayn of Raymondyn his lord within a\nChape&llbar; And immedyatly he tol&dtail; of it to\ngeffray.  Wherof he had grete joye and yede toward the\nChappellayne, the whiche whan he sawe geffray he\nkneeled tofore hym and said, 'My lord ye be ryght\nwelcome' / and syn he recounted to geffray the good\nlyf that hys fader led / and how euery day he confesse&dtail;\nhym & receyued his creatour / and that he ete nothing\nthat receyueth deth.  And thenne geffray asked hym\nwhere he was.  And the Chappellayn to hym sai&dtail;,\n'he is in yonder hermytage / but my lord as for this\nday ye may not speke with hym, but to morne ye sha&llbar;\nsee hym.'  'By my fayth,' said geffray, 'fayn I wold\nsee hym today / but sith it is soo I must take it in\npatience ty[l] tomorowe.'  'My lord, said thenne the\nChappellayn, 'yf it playse you ye may here the hye\nmasse, and therwhiles I shal ordeyne and shew your\nmeyne where your Chambre shal be dressed, and also I\nshal doo make your dyner redy at your retourne fro\nthe masse.' Thenne departed the Chappellayn fro geffray, that\nwent to here masse acompanyed with x knyghtes\nand wel xx squyers.  And thenne came the monkes\nof the place to Raymondins Chappellayn and demanded\nof hym in this wyse.  'What is that grete deue&llbar; with\nthat grete toth?  he semeth wel to be a cruel man /\nwherof knowe you hym / is he of your\nCountre?'  'By my feyth,' said the Chappellayn, 'ye / It is\ngeffray with the grete toeth of Lusynen, one of the best & moost valyaunt knightes of the world & wete it he holdeth grete possessions & grete landes.'  And the\nmonkes ansuer&dtail;, 'Wel we haue her&dtail; speke of hym /\nis it not he that sloughe the geaunt in garan&dtail; and that\nother geaunt also of Northomberlan&dtail; / he is also he\nthat brent thabbay of Maylleses with a&llbar; the monkes\n\u00feerinne bycause that hys brother was there shorne\nmonke without hys leue.'  'By my feyth,' said the\nChappellayn, 'certainly it is that same.'  And \u00feenne\nthe monkes al abasshed and afer&dtail; sayd / he is come\nhither for to doo vs some myschief and\ndommage.  Thenne said one of them, 'wete it wel that I shal hyd\nmyself in suche place that he shal not fynd\nme.  'Noo,' said the Chappellayn, 'Forsoothe I waraunt\nyou he shal doo you no hurt nor dommage, but al ye\nshal soone be gla&dtail; of hys commyng, For suche one is\nwithin this place that he loueth aboue al creatures of\nthe worl&dtail;.'  And whan they vndersto&dtail; the Chappellay&nmacr;\nthey were somwhat assured and went & hanged the\nchirche, and made al the place fayre & clene to theire\npower as god hymself had descended there / and sent\nword to the Pryour that was at Culbaston that he\nshuld come there, and that geffray with the grete toth\nwas come in pelgrymage in to theire abbaye, and noble\ncompanye with hym.  Thenne came there fourthwith\nthe pryour that fon&dtail; geffray in the Chirche, and\nhonourably made hym reuerence and sayd that he\nhymself / the monkes & al the place was at his\ncommandement.  'Sire,' said geffray, 'gramercy and\nwete it wel I loue this place / and yf god gyf me\nhelthe it shal not be the wers for my\ncommyng.'  'My lord,' said the pryour, 'god yeld you.'  Thenne\ncam the Chapellayn to geffray and hym said, 'My\nlord, your dyner is redy.'  And therwith geffray toke\nthe pryour by the hand and togidre went into the ha&llbar;,\nwhere they wesshed theire handes & syn sette them at dyner; geffray and the pryour deuysed long space\ntogidre of one thing & of o\u00feer.  And thus passed\nfoorth that day. / In this partye sayth thystorye that on \u00fee morne\ngeffray roos vp and fonde the priour and his faders\nChapellayn waytyng after hym whiche le&dtail; hym to\nhere masse / and after the masse they le&dtail; hym toward\nthe hermytages.  And thenne the pryour toke his leue\nof geffray & retourned to Chirc&hbar;war&dtail; supposyng none\nother but that geffray went for to see thestate of the\nhermytes and for none other cause.  For he had neuer\ntrowed that his fader had be \u00feer.  And thenne mounted\ngeffray toward the first hermitage that was wel lxxx\nstepes highe vpon the mountayne.  And wete it that\nthe Clerc was at Raymondyns Celle doore waytyng for\nthe Chappelayn that shuld say masse tofore\nRaymondin.  And as the Clerk loked dounward, he perceyue&dtail; geffray\nthat came upwar&dtail; & wel knew hym, and forthwith\nentred in the celle & said to Raymondin, 'My\nlord, here commeth your sone geffray.'  And whan\nRaymondin vndersto&dtail; it he was ryght joyous and said,\n'blessed be god / he is welcomme.'  Thenne entred\nfirst the Chappellain in to the Celle & salued\nRaymondyn / but he bade the Chappellayn to say\ngeffray that he myght not speke with hym tyl \u00feat hys\nmasse were doon.  And foorthwith the cha- pellayn\ndyde as Raymondyn hym commanded.  And geffray\nansuer&dtail;, 'his playsire be doo.'  This doon Raymondyn\nwas confessed and herd his masse & receyued the holy\nsacrament.  And in the meane sayson geffray behel&dtail;\nvpward the great mountaynes whiche were high &\nryght vp and sawe thermytages that were aboue hym /\nand sawe the Cape&llbar; of Saynt Mychel whiche was the\nv th hermytage, and after loked dounward / and in hym\nself had grete meruay&llbar; how man durst there take\nhabytacyon / and to hym appered the Chirche and housyng of thabbey but as lytel Chapelles.  Thenne\ncam the Chapellayn & called geffray and he entred\nwithin the Celle of his fader / and anoone kneeled on\nhis knees & dyde to hys fader reuerent salutacion /\nAnd Raymondyn toke hym vp in his armes and kyssed\nhym / and thenne made hym to sette vpon a stoole\nwith hym tofore the awter.  And there bygan geffray\nto shewe to hys fader how he was at Romme, and how\nhe was confesse&dtail; of the pope / and the pope hym said\nthat he shul&dtail; fyn&dtail; hym at Mountferrat.  And in this\ncommunycacion had they many materes togidre /\ngeffray alwayes prayeng hys fader that he wold\nretourne to his countre.  'Fayre sone,' said Raymondyn,\n'that may I not doo.  For here I wyl spen&dtail; my lyf,\nalways prayeng god for thy moder & me, & for the,\nthat god wyl amende the, my sone geffray.'  And soo\ngeffray was there al that day with his fader.  And the\nnext day in the morowe her&dtail; Raymondyn his masse,\n& receyued our lord, as hys custome was to doo / and\nafter, said to geffray, 'Fayre sone, it behoueth the to\nparte from hens, & to retourne in to thy Countre;\nand grete wel al my children & my barons.'  And\nthenne geffray toke leue of hys fader al wepyng; and\nloth he was to departe from his fader.  And after\ncame doun fro the mountayn vnto thabbaye, where\nhe was honourably receyued / and the monkes had\ngrete meruay&llbar; wherfore he was so long\naboue. Thystorye sheweth that geffray gaf grete ryches &\nfayre jewelles to the Chirche, & after toke leue of\nthe pryour & his monkes, but the pryour hym conueye&dtail;\nvnto Culbaston, wher geffray dyned with the pryour /\nand tol&dtail; hym in secret wyse that Raymondyn was\nhys fader, whom geffray besoughte to take hede to\nhys fader, and that the Chirche shuld not lese nothing\ntherby, For euery yere ones duryng hys lyf he wold\ncome & vysyte hys fader.  Thenne ansuer&dtail; the pryour, 'doubte you not, my lord, there shal be no deffawte but\nI shal vysyte & remembre your fader.'  And thenne\ntoke geffray leue & went to Barselone to hys\nbed.  And on the morne he departed toward Lusynen wher\nas Theodoryk hys brother & the barons receyued hym\nwith ryght grete joye, and were glad of his\ncommyng.  And whan they were at leyser, geffray shewed to hys\nbrother theodoryk the very effect of euery thin&gtee;\ntouchyng theyre fader.  Foorthwith Theodoryk that\nmoche loued his fader bygan to wepe ful\ntenderly.  And geffray seeyng his bro\u00feer make suche sorowe to\nhym said thus, 'My ryght dere brother, yet must ye\nabyde here, For wete it wel that I wyl goo see our\ntwo bretheren in almayne, that is to vnderstan&dtail;\nRegnauld king of behayne and the Duc Anthony of\nLucembourgh / but I wyl not departe without aray\nof men of armes, For \u00feer be in thoo marches ryght\neuyl peple the whic&hbar; gladly wold robbe them that passe\nby the way.'  'By my sowle, my brother, I hold wel\nwithal that ye doo as ye say / but I beseche you ryght\nentierly brother that we leue our countre in the\ngouernaunce of our barons & take with vs v.C. men of\narmes, and that it may playse you I to go with you;\nFor I haue her&dtail; say that there is grete werre betwix\nthem of Anssay & them of Austeryche.'  'By my\nfeyth,' said geffray, 'Ye say wel, For perauenture our\nbrother Anthony is in han&dtail; with them.'  And whan\nthey had made theire ordonnaunce, Odon the Erle of\nMarche came and spake with geffray, and brought in\nhys company thre score men of armes, For at that\ntyme he had warre ayenst the Earle of Vandosme /\nand also Raymond their brother Earle of Forestz cam\nthere the same day.  And there the foure bretheren\nmade there moche one of other / and were joyfu&llbar; for\nthe tydynges that they her&dtail; of theire fader / and said /\nones they hoped to see hym togidre.", "59": "Cap.

And so lefte he a good gouernour in\nhys countre / And in lyke wyse dyde his bro\u00feer\ntheodoryk in his Countre.  And whan Odon &\nRaymond sawe that they wold departe to go to see\ntheire bretheren in Allemayne, they sayd in lyke wyse\nwol&dtail; they doo.  And commanded anoone theire peple\nto mete with them at Boneua&llbar;.  And at that tyme\nwere the bretheren acompanyed with two thousand\nmen of armes & a thousand Crosbowes.

And he pardonned hym of al the mysdedes that he\nhad doo to hym.  And the erle of Vandosme made\nhym homage of the lan&dtail; that was in debat atwix\nthem. / Here sheweth thystorye that the foure bretheren\ndeparted fro Boneual & were in theire companye\nmany grete lordes, and rode in fayre aray tyl they cam\nvpon an euen and lodged them nygh a ryuere called\nMeuze, by a Fortresse named the Castel Duras.  But\nas now I shal cease of them to speke / and shal\nbegynne to speke of the kyng of anssay, that had grete\nwarre ayenst the Erle of Frebourgh & with the Duc of\nAusteryche, the whic&hbar; had besieged hym within a\nCastel of hys that was called Pourrencru.

And where we haue vnderstan&dtail; that\nwithout ony lawfu&llbar; quare&llbar; or raysonnable cause ye haue\ngretly hurt & dommaged bothe the land & peuple of\nour ryght welbeloued vncle the kin&gtee; of Anssay, the\nwhiche as now ye haue besieged within his Castel of\nPourrencru, And for as moc&hbar; that we be therfor\nmeue&dtail;, & entende & purpose to entre in your lan&dtail; to\ndystroye you & al your peuple / consyderyng the\nnoble ordre of knight- hode that it shal not be by vs\nmynnsshed.  We \u00feerfor by our messager sen&dtail; you\noure letres of deffyaunce, &c.'  Thenne was delyuered\nthe letre to a herault, whic&hbar; rode tyl he came to the\nsiege of Pourrencru wher he presented the said lettre\nto the Duc of Austryc&hbar;. the whiche letres were red&dtail;\nin heryng of al \u00fee lordes there.  Thenne said they of\nAllemayne the Deuell hath brought hem hyther, none\nother renomme is now thrugh al the world but of them\nof Lusynen.  Thenne retourned the herault toward the\nsix bretheren, and to them shewe&dtail; the manere how\nthey of theire enemyes oost were meruaylled.  'By my\nfeyth they haue her&dtail; speke of vs from ferre / but now\nthey shal see vs nere to them.' / It is trouth that\nthenne geffray departed with fyue hondred men of\narmes from his oost & went and embusshed his peuple\nin a lytel wo&dtail; nygh the toun of Frebourgh.  This doon he & ten knyghtes with hym, & a squyer of\nLucembourgh that ryght wel coude speke Almayn\ntonge & knew al the Countre, went vpon a lytel\nmountayne to behol&dtail; & see how he myght entre in\nthe toun / but or he departed he said to them of his\nembusshe in this manere: 'Sires, I entende & purpose\nwith the help of god to haue the toun of Frebourgh or\nto morne pryme at our playsire.  Wherfore this nyght\nI sha&llbar; departe with this X knyghtes and this esquyer,\n& at the spryng of the day I shal bygynne myn\nenterpryse / and but loke wel whan ye perceyue vs\nwithin the gate that fourthwith ye marche toward\nvs.'  And thenne about thre of the clokk after mydnyght\nGeffray / his ten knyghtes and his guyde toke eche\nof them a sack fu&llbar; of hey and bare it before them\nvpon tharsons of theire sadels.  In this manere they\nwent & came tofore the gate of Frebourg&hbar;, where as\nthe said esquyer called the watche \u00feat they myght\nentre, sayeng that they were frendes and that they had\nbe a&llbar; that nyght in fourrage.  Thenne asked hym the\nporter what they had in thoo sackes, the squyer ansuer&dtail;\nthere ben in gownes & suche thinges and suche ware /\nthat we haue take vpon our enemyes and we bryng\nthem hyther to selle them.  The porter thenne\nsupposyng they had be of Allemayne & theire frendes\nopend the gate & lete fa&llbar; the bridge.  Thenne entred\ngeffray first of alle, and foorthwith drew his swer&dtail; and\nslew the porter / and in conclusyon they slough al\nthem of the watche.  Thenne was there the cry of\nthem of the toun 'treson / treson' / And immedyatly\nmarched thembusshe & came & entred in the toun.\nThere was grete occisyon of them of the toun / but\nmany of them escaped and fledd.  And whan this was\ndoon geffray lefte there foure hondred men of armes &\nretourne&dtail; with the residue toward hys oost that he\nmete by the way toward the siege.  Of this noble enterpryse & valyaunt fayt the brethern of geffray and\nal theire peple were meruaylled / sayeng that geffray\nwas the moost valyaunt knyght & subtyl in the faytte\nof armes that lyued at that day.  And joyous & glad\nthey marched courageously toward theire enemyes.\nAnoon after came tydynges to the siege how Frebourgh\nwas lost, wherof the Duc of Austeryche and in especial\nthe Erle of Frebourgh were sorowful & wroth.  'By\nmy feyth,' said thenne the Duc of Austeryc&hbar;, 'they\nbe subtyl men of warre & moc&hbar; to be doubted.  Yf we\nloke not wel about vs they myght we&lbar; gyue vs a grete\nchak.'  Wherfor they called theire Counsey&llbar;. In this partye sayth thystorye that on the next day\nby the morowe the six bretheren her&dtail; masse, and\nafter ordeyned \u00feeire bataylles / geffray & his thre\nbretheren that were come with hym conduyted the first\nbatay&llbar;, Anthony had the secon&dtail;, And regnauld the\nIII de .  And so marched forth in fayr ordynaunce, and\nso wel renged that it was a fayre sight to\nbehol&dtail;.  And whan the sonne bygan to shewe bryght & clere\nthey came vpon a lytel mountayn into the\nvaley.  Thenne were they percyued, and they of the siege\nbygan to cry alarme.  Thenne armed hym euery man,\nAnd in theire best wyse came & renged them before\nthe bataylles of the brethern.  Thenne bygan the\nbataylles of bothe sydes to approche eche other / and\nwith grete cryes of one part & of other medled & ranne\nwith theire sperys vpon eche other.  The grounde was\nthere soone dye&dtail; rede with grete effusyon of\nblood.  For Geffray with hys swerd smote at the lyfte syde\n& at the ryght syde vpon his enemyes & ouerthrew or\nsloughe a&llbar; them that he recountred.  And the six\nbaners of the bretheren rengid them togidre in fayre\naray.  There were the armes of Lusynen wel shewed\nand knowen in pycture, and also by pesaunt and\nhorryble strokes, For the six bretheren perced the prees & smote, cuttyng heedes, armes, & leghes of\ntheire enemyes here & there, and made suche occysyon\nthat it was meruaylle / Geffray recountred by aduenture\nthe Duc of Austryc&hbar;, on whom he descharged hys\nswer&dtail; by suc&hbar; myght that he made hym to staker al\nastonyed, And thenne theodoryk that was nygh by,\nstrak hym fourthwith and ouerthrew hym, and so\nincontynent he was take.  And the noble and valyaunt\nAnthony dyde ryght valyauntly, For he toke the Erle\nFreburgh and made hym to delyuere his swer&dtail; to hym,\nand after betoke hym to foure knightes.  What shuld\nI make long compte . they of Allemayne were\ndyscomfyted and bygan to flee.  Thenne came the kyn&gtee;\nof Anssay out of the Fortres glad & joyous of the\ndyscomfyture of hys enemyes, and came to the brethern\ntentes where he thanked them moche of theire noble\nsocour and gretly festyed them.  And were brought\nthere tofore hym the Duc of Austeryche & the Erle of\nFrebourgh with syx noble barons / and to hym said\nthe bretheren, 'Sire, here ben your enemyes as\nprysonners, doo of them your playsyr.'  And the kyng\nthanke&dtail; them gretly & humbly.  And this doon geffray\nand hys bretheren that were c&omacr;e with hym toke\nleue of the kyng of Anssay, of theire brethern Anthony\n& Regnauld, and retourned in theire Countre.  But\nthystory sayth that aftirward a&llbar; the bretheren fonde\neche other togidre at Mountferrat, where they held a\nnoble feste for loue of Raymondyn theire fader, whiche\nwas ryght gla&dtail; and joyous to see there his children,\nbut soone he toke leue of them and retourned in to hys\nhermytage.  And thenne the six bretheren gaaf grette\nryches & jewels to the chirche there, and after departed\nand toke leue eche one of other & retourned to theire\nCountrees, some by the see & other by lan&dtail;. Here testyfyeth thistorye that as long as Raymondyn\nlyued, Geffray & theodoryk came there euery yere ones to see hym / but it befe&llbar; on a day, as they\nwere bothe at Lusynen redy for to go to Mountferrat,\na meruayllous auenture, For there was seen vpon the\nbatelments of the Castel a grete & horryble serpent the\nwhich cryed with a femenyne voys, wherof a&llbar; the\npeuple was abasshed / but wel they wyst that it was\nMelusyne / whan the two bretheren behel&dtail; it, teerys\nin habundaunce bygan to fa&llbar; fro their eyen; For they\nknew wel that it was their moder.  And whan the\nserpent sawe them wepe, she enclyned the heed toward\nthem, casting suche an horryble cry & so doulorous\nthat it semed them that her&dtail; it that the Fortres shuld\nhaue fa&llbar;.  And anoone aftir the two bre\u00feern geffray\n& theodoryk departed toward Mountferrat where they\ncame and fon&dtail; their fader deed, whereof they\nlamented & made grete sorow and anoone clothed\nthemself and al theire meyne in blak, and ordeyned\nfor thobsequye of their fader.  There came the kyng\nof aragon with many grete lordes that offred at the\nmasse.  And whan the scruyse was doon & the corps\nburyed honourably / geffray went & thanke&dtail; the\nkyn&gtee; and his barons of thonour that \u00feey had doon to\nhys fader and to his brother & hym. / Thus as thystorye sheweth was thobsequye of\nRaymondyn deuoutly & nobly doon, and a ryche\nsepulture was made & sette vpon his graue, & trouth\nit is that Bernardon the neuew of Geffray was there\nthat ryght wel coude behaue hym among the ladyes,\nin so moche that the quene of Aragon, that was there,\ndesyred her lord to demande of Geffray what that yong\ngentylman was / and that / the kyng dide gladly.\nAnd thenne geffray ansuer&dtail;, 'Sire, he is my neuew,\nsone to the Erle of Marche my brother.'  'Certaynly,\nGeffray,' said the kyng, 'Wel I byleue that, For he is\nwel nourrytured and semeth wel to be of noble extraction / and wete it wel that his contenaunce\nplayseth vs ryght wel and so dooth lyke wyse to the\nquene / and veryly yf it playse&dtail; you to suffre hym\nabyde with vs in our Court we wold doo for hym that\nhe & you bothe shuld be playsed therwith.'  'Sire,'\nsaid geffray, 'his fader hath another sone and two\ndoughtirs, & syth it is your playsir to haue hym he is\ncome hither with vs in a good heure & that playseth\nme wel.'  And thenne the kyng thanked hym moche,\nand so dyde the quene.  And wete it that Bernardon Wedded aftirward, at thinstaunce & prayer of the\nkyng of Aragon, the doughtir of the lor&dtail; Cabyeres that\nhad none to hys heyre but her.  And thenne the\nkyn&gtee; and the quene, lordes & ladyes, toke theire leue\nof the two bretherne, the whiche after grete yeftes of\nryches by them youen to the chirc&hbar; toke leue of the\npryour and hys monkes, and after departed and\nretourned to Lusynen, where as they called to them a&llbar;\nthe baronnye and there was thobsequye of Raymondyn\nhonourably doon.  And aftir Geffray shewe&dtail; to his\nbrother Odon, Erle of Marche, how & wherfore hys\nsone Bernardon was lefte with the kyng of Aragon,\nwherof he was gla&dtail;.  And thenne the bretheren and\nthe barons toke leue of Geffray and retourned to theire\ncountrees.  And Geffray abode at Lusynen and dyde\naftirward moche good; For he reedyfyed the noble\nAbay of Maylleses and dyde grete almesse to the poure\npeuple. Thystorye sayth that a&llbar; the heyres of Raymondyn\nand Melusyne regned nobly, that is to wete\nVryan in Cipre, Guyon in Armenye, Regnault in\nBehayne, Anthony in Lucembourgh, Odon in Marche,\nRaymonet in Forestz, Geffray in Lusynen, and\nTheodoryk in Partenay.  And of theyre lynee are\nyssued them of Castel Regnault, They of Penbrough in Englan&dtail; / they of Cabyeres in Aragon, and they of\nCardillak in Quercyn. / Here after saith thistory that geffray ten yere aftir\nthe decez of Raymondin his fader gouerned\nryght wel & kept goo&dtail; justice in his lan&dtail; / but duryng\nthat long space of tym he asked of his receyuours none\nacomptes, but whan the receyuours wol&dtail; haue shewed\ntheire acomptes he to them ansuer&dtail; in this manere:\n'What acomptes wol&dtail; ye shew to me?  For as touching\nmyself I wyl none other acompte, but that justice be\nwel and truly kept thrugh al my lan&dtail;, and my tounes\n& Castels wel entreteyned, and gol&dtail; & syluer to hold\n& kepe myn estate / trow ye that I wyl make a paleys\nof gol&dtail; / the stone that my lady my moder me gaf,\nsuffyseth me ryght wel.'  And thenne hys stywardes &\ngouernours ansuer&dtail;, 'certaynly, my lord, it behoueth\nwel to a prynce to here and see what he spendeth, at\nlest ones in a yere / al were it but for the saluacyon\nof hys receyuours in tyme to come and for to gyue\nthem quytaunce.' Here sayth thistory that geffray consenti&dtail; to here\nthacomptes of his receyuours.  And it came to an article where he\nvndersto&dtail; that X. soublz were payed euery\nyere only for the pommel of the hyest toure of hys Fortresse of\nLusynen / he anone rested there and asked why it was not made so\nstrong that it myght laste many wynter.  'My lord,' ansuerd the\nreceyuours / 'it is rente annue&llbar;.'  'What say ye?'  said geffray\n/ 'I hold not the fortresse but only of god my Creatour / wel happy I\nwere yf he held me quyte therfor of a&llbar; my synnes / but telle me\nto whom ye paye.'  'Certaynly,' said they / 'we wot not' / 'How\nthenne,' said Geffray / 'ye desyre of me quytaunce therof / so wyl I\nhaue quytaunce of hym that receyueth it of you / as rayson\nis / but by god ye shal not begy&llbar; me soo, for yf I may\nknowe who that taketh that annuel rente of me, he\nshal shew me goo&dtail; letres therof made / or he or ye\nsha&llbar; yel&dtail; me ayen the said annuel rente fro the tyme\nthat ye first alowed it in your acomptes vnto now.'\nThenne said the receyuours to Geffray in this manere:\n'My lord, trouth it is / that six yere agoo after the\ndoulorous departyng of my lady your moder from your\nfader / euery yere vpon the last day of August was\nsene a grete han&dtail; that toke the pommel of the said\ntoure & pully&dtail; it fro the toure by so grete strength\nthat the rouf of the tour brak therwithal, and so it\ncoste&dtail; euery yere to make ayen xx ti or xxx&lbar;i.  thanne\ncame a man to my lord your fader which he nor no man\nknew what he was, and counseylled hym that euery\nyere vpon the last day of August he shuld doo take\na purse of hertis leeder and to be put in it xxx pieces\nof syluer, eche piece worth foure penys, that made in\nsumma ten shelin&gtee;, And that this purse shuld be putte\nvpon the pommel of the said toure / and by that shuld\nthe pommel abyde styl and not hurt nor dommaged /\nand euer syth tyl now it hath thus be doon.'  And\nwhan geffray vndersto&dtail; this meruay&llbar; he bygan to\nthinke, and long he was or he ansuer&dtail; or sai&dtail; ony\nwor&dtail;. / Thystorye witnesseth that long thought Geffray\nvpon this faytte, and after he said in this manere:\n'Sires, how wel that I byleue that it is as ye say,\nNeuertheles I charge you vpon peyne of deth that ye\nno more paye the said annuel, but at the last day of\nAugust bryng to me the purse and the money, For I\nwyl make the payement myself.'  Thenne sent geffray\nfor hys brother theodoryk in Partenay, and also for\nhys brother Raymond in Forestz, that they shuld be with hym at Lusynen the xxvi ti day of August.  And\nwhan they were come he shewed to them al the\nmatere of the said annuel rente, and said that he neuer\nshuld suffre it to be payed; but that he first knew to\nwhom and why the fortres of Lusynen was boun&dtail; thus\nfor to doo.  And whan the last day of August came,\nGeffray her&dtail; hys masse and receyued ryght deuoutely\nthe holy sacrement and immedyately armed hym, and\nbad the preste putte the stolle about his nek / and\naftir toke the purse with the money therin.  And\n\u00feenne he bad his bretheren farwel, sayeng in this\nmanere: 'I wyl departe and serche for hym that thus\nyerly taketh trybute of my fortresse / but I assure you\nyf he be no more of strength than I am I sha&llbar; hastly\nbyreue hym of hys trybute.'  And so he yede vp to\nthe vpermost stage of the donjon / and his bretheren\nand the barons taryed benethe in grete doubte and fere\nthat geffray shuld be perysshed / but geffray was therof\nnot agast / but loked long yf he coude see eny thing. A&llbar; thus as thystory sheweth geffray reste&dtail; there\nfro none to thre of the clok, that he ne her&dtail; nor\nsawe nothin&gtee;.  but anoone after he her&dtail; a grete noyse\nwherwith a&llbar; the donjon shook / and as he loked\ntofore hym he perceyued a grete knyght armed of al\npoynts, that said to hym with a hye voys, 'Thou\ngeffray, wilt thou denye my trybute that of ryght I\nought to haue vpon the pommel of this toure of the\nwhic&hbar; I was seasyd & enpocessi&dtail; by thy\nfader?'  'Thenne,' said Geffray, 'where are the letres?  yf thou\nhast them, shew it how my fader was boun&dtail;, and yf I\nsee thou hast good ryght / here is the money redy to\npaye the.'  and thenne the knyght ansuer&dtail; in this\nmanere: 'I had neuer letres therof / but wel & truly\nhaue I be paye&dtail; and neuer denye&dtail; tyl now.'  'By my\nfeyth,' said geffray, 'al were it good debte and thy\nryght to haue it / yet shuldest thou haue grete peyne to recouere it of me.  And on the other part thou\nholdest me for thy subget & woldest hol&dtail; me in\nseruitude and thou hast therof nothing to shew.  but\nwhat art thou that thus by the space of XVI. yere\nhast thevely take this trybute?  / I now deffye the by\nthe myght of my sauyour and the I chalenge for myn\nherytage.'  'By my feyth,' said the knyght, 'doubte\nnot therof but that I am a creature of god, and myn\nname shalt thou knowe tyme ynough.'  And without\neny more questyon eche of them recountred other with\nmyghty & gret strokes.  And what with that and with\nthe stampyng of theire feet, the noyse was so grete\nthat al \u00feey that were benethe were abasshed, and\nsuppose&dtail; that the donjon shul&dtail; haue fa&llbar;.  Wherfor\nthey wyst wel that geffray had somwhat to doo.  And\nhis bretheren shuld haue assysted hym, but geffray had\nthem deffended so to do.  And wete it wel whan the\nknyght of the tour fon&dtail; Geffray so fyers & so strong,\nhe putte his swer&dtail; vp in the shede and thrugh his\npaueys behin&dtail; hym.  And whan Geffray sawe hym\nthat doo / he dyde lyke wyse with his shel&dtail; / but he\nwith bothe his handes smote the knyght vpon the\nhelmet with his swer&dtail; so myghtyly that he staker&dtail;\n\u00feerwith.  And thenne the knight toke geffray in his\narmes / and with that geffray lete fa&llbar; his swer&dtail; and\nwrestled with hym / and wete it wel ther was lytel\nfauour shewed on neyther part.  And whan the\nknyght perceyued the purse about geffrays neck he\nsupposed to haue had it from hym / but geffray kept\nhym therfro / sayen&gtee; / 'or thou haue purse or money\nit shal cost the the best bloo&dtail; in thy body / but for\ntrouth I meruay&llbar; how thou mayst so long withstand\nme.'  'By my feyth,' said the knight, 'I haue more\nmeruaylle how thou mayst withstand my strengthe /\nbut to morowe shalt thou haue a new day with me, For now the sonne is to his rest, and thou shalt fynd\nme yonder vpon that medowe beyon&dtail; the ryuere al\nredy armed to chalenge the and my ryght.  But thou\nshalt assure me \u00feat no personne shal passe the ryuere\nbut thou.'  'By my feyth,' said geffray, 'I the assure\nno more ther shal not,' and with that he departed that\ngeffray wyst not where he became.  'By my feyth,'\nsayd thenne geffray, 'here is apert messager, I haue\ngrete meruaylle what this may be,' and so came he\ndoun and brought with hym the knightes sheld that\nhe had wonne. Thystorye witnesseth whan Geffray was come doun,\nhys sheld about his neck and the knyghtis\npaueys in his ryght hand that he had wonne / and in\nhis other han&dtail; the purse with the money, hys bretheren\nand the baronnye \u00feere were abasshed therwith, and\nasked hym whom he had fon&dtail;.  And thenne he said\nhe had fond the moost valyaunt knyght that euer he\ndyde dedes of armes withal.  And to them shewed al\nthe maner of batay&llbar; & of theire couenaunt / and how\nhe wol&dtail; haue had the purse, and how he departed so\nsodaynly.  and they bygan to lawhe, sayeng \u00feat neuer\ntofore they herd of suche a thing.  But whan they\nsawe geffrays helmet & al hys harneys so perysshed\nwith strokes, they had no courage to lawhe, For they\nknew wel there was sore batay&llbar;.  And on the next\nday erly geffray roos, and he & hys brethern herd\nmasse & drank ones.  And thenne armed hym at al\npieces & mounted on horsbak / And his bretheren and\n\u00fee barons ye&dtail; to conueye hym to the ryuere, where he\ntoke leue of them and passed ouer on the other syde\nof the ryuere. / Thystorye telleth that anoone Geffray fon&dtail; \u00fee\nknyght and to hym said with a hye voys, 'Sire knyght, be ye he that wyl take the trybute vpon my\nFortresse?'  And he ansuer&dtail;, 'ye by my feith.'  And ryght forth said geffray, 'I chalenge the, wherfor\ndeffende the.'  And whan the knight vndersto&dtail; this,\nhe sette the spere in the rest and geffray lyke wyse /\nand so eche of them recountred other / by force wherof\nthey brak thaire speris to the hard fyst in many\npieces.  And whan they had thus manfully broken theire speris\nthey drew out theire swerdes and smote eche other\nwith grete & myghty strokes that the fyre sprang out of\ntheire harneys, wherof the peple vpon the ryuere syde\nha&dtail; grete meruay&llbar; & were al abasshed how that euer\nthey might endure the grete strokes, For they left not\none piece of harneys hool.  And they faught fro the\nmorow vnto thre of the Clok at aftirnone and neuer\nseaced.  And so grete was the batay&llbar; that none wist whic&hbar; of them had the bettre.  And thenne\nthe knight bygan to say to geffray / 'here me now, I\nhaue the wel assayd / and as touching the trybute I\nthe quyte.  And wete it wel that / that I haue doo,\nit hath be for the prouffyt of thy fader & of his sowle,\nFor it is trouth that the pope enjoyned hym by way\nof penaunce for the forsweryng that he had don to\nthy moder to founde a monastery, the whiche penaunce\nwas not by hym obserued.  but it is so yf thou\nwylt edyfye an hospital, and founde therin a preste to\nsyng dayly for thy faders sowle / thy fortres fro this\nday fourthon shalbe quyte of ony trybute / how be\nit there shal be sene about the tour more meruaylles\nthan in eny other place of \u00fee world.'  And geffray\nansuer&dtail;, 'yf I knew for certayn that thou were of god\nI wol&dtail; gladly fullfu&llbar; thy wy&llbar; in this\nbyhalf.'  / And he said he was.  And thenne geffray said / 'be\nthou sure this shal be doon yf it playse god.  but I\npray the say me what thou art.'  And the knyght\nansuer&dtail;, 'Geffray, enquere no ferther, For as for this\ntyme thou mayst knowe no more / but only that I am a Creature of god.'  And therwith he vanysshed that\ngeffray wyst not where he became / wherof meruaylled\nmoche they that were by \u00fee ryuere.  And thenne came\ngeffray ouer the ryuer to his bretheren, whiche asked\nhym how he had doo and where hys party aduerse was\nbecome.  And geffray to them sayd that they were\nacorded togidre, but where he was become he coude\nnot te&llbar;.  And thenne they retourned to Lusynen\nwhere geffray dide doo han&gtee; the paueys, that he had\nwonne vpon the knyght of the toure, in the myddes of\nhis ha&llbar;.  Where as it heng tyl geffray had edyfyed\nthe said hospytal, For thenn it vanysshed away that\nno man wyst where it became.  And here fynyssheth\nthe hystory of the heyres of Lusynen.  but bycause\nthat the kynges of Armanye ben yssued of that lynee,\nI wyl shewe herafter an auenture that befe&llbar; to a kyng\nof Armanye. Thystorye sayth that long after the deces of kyng\nguyon of Armanye, Ther was a kinge of that\nlan&dtail; yong and fayre, lecherous and folowyng his wy&llbar;.\nThe kyng vndersto&dtail; by the report of som knightes\nvyageours, that there was in the grete Armanye a\nCastel whereas was in the most fayre lady that men\nwyst at that tyme in al the world / the whiche lady\nhad a sperhauk / and to al knightes of noble extraction\nthat thither went & coude watche the said sperhauk\nduryng the space of thre dayes and thre nyghtes\nwithout slepe / the lady shuld appiere tofore them and\ngyue them suche worldly yeftes as they wold wysshe\nand were desyryng to haue, except only her self.  This\nkyng thenne that was lusty and in his best age, and\nthat vndersto&dtail; the renommee of thexcellent beaulte of\nthe sai&dtail; lady / said he wold go thither / and that of\nthe lady he shuld nothing take but herself.  But wete\nit that in the said Castel might none entre but ones in a yere / and that was the day tofore the vygille of\nsaynt Johan / and the next day after saynt Johans\nday euery man must departe thens.  Whan the said\nkyng was redy he departed & rode with noble company\nso long that he cam to the forsaid Castel at the day\nassygned, tofore the which he dide dresse vp a ryche\npauyllon and there he souped, and aftir went to rest.\nAnd on the morne he roos and her&dtail; masse / and after\nthat the masse was do, he drank ones, and syn armed\nhym and toke leue of them that were come with hym,\nwhic&hbar; were sorowfu&llbar; for his departing, For they\ntrowed that neuer he shuld haue come ayen.  And\nthis doon the kyng yed toward the sperhauk in the\nCastel. / Here saith thistory that whan the king was at\nthentree of the Castel, an old man al clothed in\nwhyte cam ayenst hym, & asked hym who that had\nbrought hym thither / and he ansuer&dtail; in this manere:\n'I am come hither to seke thauenture and to haue the\nCustome of this Castel.'  And the good old man said to\nhym / 'ye be ryght welcome, folow ye me, and I shal\nshew you the auenture that ye seke for.'  Thenne\nyede the king aftir the old man / and gretly was he\nmeruaylled of the grete & inestimable riches that he\nsawe, within the place.  And thene entred the old\nman into a noble ha&llbar; rychely hanged, And aftir hym\nentred the kyng that perceyue&dtail; in the myddes of the\nha&llbar; a long horne of a vnycorne that was fayre &\nwhyte / and therupon was spred a grete cloth of gold\nwheron stod the sperhauk and a gloue of whyt sylk\nvnder his feet.  Thenne said the old man to the kynge\nin this wyse: 'Sire, here ye may see thaduenture of\nthis Castel / and with it sethen ye are so ferfoorth\nc&omacr;me ye must watche this sperhauk thre days and thre\nnyghtes without slep.  And yf Fortune suffre you so\nto doo, wete it wel \u00feat the noble lady of this rya&llbar; Castel sha&llbar; appiere tofore you on the foureth day, to\nwhom ye shal aske that thing of the world whiche ye\ndesyre moost to haue / except her body / and no\ndoubte of but ye shal haue it / but wete it certaynly\nyf ye desire and aske to haue herself, euyl auenture\nshal fa&llbar; to you therof.'", "60": "Cap. LX. How the king of Armanye watched the sperhauk. The forsaid ol&dtail; man aftir that he had declared\nand shewed to the kyng the manere of watching\nof the sperhauk, he departed fro the halle / and the\nkyng abode alone and had grete meruay&llbar;, what of the\ngrete ryches \u00feat he sawe there, as of a ryche table that\nwas in the ha&llbar; couered nobly with al maner deyntes of\nmeetes.  And that part he drew hym self & ete a lytel\nand drank of that lyked best & kept good dyete and\nmade none exces, For wel he knewe that to moc&hbar;\nmeet & drynk causeth the body to be pesaunt & slepy.\nAnd to dryue fourth the tyme walked vp & doun the\nha&llbar;, takin&gtee; grete playsyr of the grete noblesse that\nhe sawe, For there were ryche pictures where as were\nfygured many a noble hystory, and the wrytyng\nvndernethe that shewed the vnderstandyng of it.\nAnd emong other hystoryes was there fygured the\nnoble hystory of kyng Elynas & queen Pressyne his\nwyf, and of their thre doughtirs, and how they\nclosed their fader in the mountayne of Brombelyo in\nNorthomberlan&dtail; / and how Pressyne theire moder\npunysshe&dtail; them therfor / and al the circonstaunces of\n\u00feeir faytes were there shewed in letres of gold fro \u00fee\nbygynnyng vnto the ende. Grete playsir toke the king to rede & see the said\nhystoryes.  And thus he watched lokyng here\nand there vnto the thirde day.  And thene he\nperceyued a right noble chambre, and sawe the doore al\nwy&dtail; open / and that part he went and entred in the\nchambre, and beheld \u00feer many knyghtes armed fygured\nand rychely paynted on the walles, and vnder their\nfeet were their names writon in letres of gold and of\nwhat lynee & countre they were / and aboue their\nheedes was writon in this manere: 'Vpon suche a\ntyme watched this knight in this Castel the noble\nsperhauk, but he slept / and therfore he most hol&dtail;\ncompany with the lady of this place as long as he may\nlyue, and nothing worldly shal he wante of that his\nherte can desire saf only the departyng fro the\nplace.'  And there nygh were paynted thre sheldes in a rowe,\nand on them were fygured the armes of thre knyghtes\nand their names / their lynee & their Contre that they\nwere of were writon vnderneth / and aboue the sheldes\nwas shewed by wrytyng this that foloweth: 'In suche\na yere watched our sperhauk this noble knight wel\nand duely and departed with joye and had his yeft of\nvs with hym.'  And so long behel&dtail; the king that he\nalmost slept / but he anoon came out of the Chambre\nand sawe the sonne almost doun and passed fourth\nthat nyght without slepe. Thenne was he glad whan he perceyued \u00fee\nday.  And foorthwith at the rysyng of the sonne cam\nthe lady of the Castel in so noble and so ryche aray\nthat the kyng had grete meruay&llbar; therof / and what of\nher ryches as of her excellent beaute, he was gretly\nabasshed.  And thenne the lady dide her obeyssaunce,\nsayeng in this manere: 'Noble kyng of Armanye, ye\nbe ryght welcome.  For certaynly ye haue wel &\nvalyauntly endeuoired you.  now aske of me what\nyefte that so euer playse you worldly and raysounable,\nand ye shal haue it without ony taryeng.'  Thenne\nansuerd the king that right sore was esprysed of the\nloue of her, 'By my feyth, gracyous & noble lady, I aske neyther gold nor syluer, Cyte, toun, nor Castel,\nFor thanked be god I haue of al worldly ryches ynough /\nbut yf it playse you, my ryht dere & right entierly\nbeloued lady, I wyl haue you to my wyf.'  An&dtail; whan\nthe lady vndersto&dtail; this she was wrot&hbar;, and by grete\nyre she said to hym in this wyse: 'Ha, thou grete foole,\nFor nought hast thou asked my body, For thou mayst\nnot by no wyse haue it.'  Thenne said the king to\nthe lady, 'Wel I haue, to myn aduys, endeuoired me.\nWherfor, noble lady, be you fauourable to me and haue\nregar&dtail; to the custome of this castel.'  'By my feyth,'\nansuer&dtail; the lady, 'as touching thaduenture & custome\nof this Castel, I wyl that it be obserued & kept / but\naske of me yeft raysounable / and no doubte of but\nthou shalt haue it.' 'By my feyth, noble lady, I desyre\nnone other thing erthly nor none other I shal not aske\nnor take of you, but only your gracyous body.'  'Ha,\nfole, fole,' said thenne the lady, 'euyl myscheaunce\nshal fa&llbar; on the, yf thou soone chaungest not thy\npurpos, and so it shal to al thin heyres & successours\naftir \u00fee / though they be not culpable therof.'  And\nthe kyng her ansuer&dtail;, 'It is for nought, For my\nherte is rauysshed of your beaute, and only fedde with\nyour syght.  And therfore your body wyl I haue and\nnone other thing erthly.' /", "61": "Cap. LXI. How the kyng wold haue rauysshed by force the lady, but she vanysshed away. Whan thenne the lady sawe that the kyng\nchaunged not his purpos, she was ryght wroth,\nand to hym sai&dtail; in this manyere: 'Thou folyssh kyng,\nnow shalt thou lese the syght of me, & shalt fay&llbar; of\nthy yefte, & hast putte thyself in auenture to abyde\nwithin for euer in grete payne & tourment, bycause that thou art yssued of the lynee of kyng guyon that was\nsone to Melusyne my sustir, and I am his ante / and\nthou art so nygh of my blood and kynred that though\nI wol&dtail; be consentyng to thy wy&llbar; holy Chirc&hbar; wold\nneuer suffre it.'

Wherof he was\nal to brusi&dtail; in euery part of his body, and was drawen\nby the feet fro the halle vnto the barrers without the\nCastel.

And as soone as he\nmyght he stode vpon his feet, cursyng a thousan&dtail;\ntymes hym that first brought hym tydynges of this\nauenture, and the heure also that euer he cam thither.\nAnd thenne he went toward his meyne that saw his\nharneys al to broken and perysshed, and demanded of hym in this manere: 'My lord, vs semeth that ye be\nsore hurt, haue ye had batay&llbar; there as ye haue\nbe?'

The yere of our lord a\nthousand [ccc] Note to C. Brunet's Fr. Ed., page 420. Le texte porte: mil iiij vingz et xiiij.  C'est \u00e9videmment une erreur puisque Jean d'Arras dit, d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res pages, qu'il a commenc\u00e9 cette histoire en 1387. In the Harl. MS. of Melusine the date is given as 'le VIIe jour d'aoust l'an de grace Mil iiiC iiiX et XIII.' lxxx & foureteen. / Now have I shewed to you after the very Cronykles\nand true history how the noble Fortresse of\nLusynen in Poytou was edyfyed & made / and of the\nnoble yssue & lynee of the foundatours therof, on whos\nsowles god haue mercy / the whiche fortresse of\nLusynen is a now come but of late, by manere of\nConqueste, into the handes of the ryght noble & myghty prynce my right redoubted lord Johan sone to the kyng\nof Fraunce, Duc of Berry, Auuergne, &c., by whos\ncommandement I haue endeuoired me after my rude and\nsymple entendement to collige & gadre emon&gtee; many\ngestes & true Cronykles the trouth of thystory byfore\nspecyfyed.  And wete it for trouth that oftentymes I\nhaue her&dtail; my said lord say that a knyght called\nSersue&llbar; that held the said Fortres as lieuftenaunt &\nCaptayne there for the kyng of Englan&dtail; / at that tyme\nthat my said lord had besieged / said to hym after the\nreducyon of the Fortres / that thre dayes tofore, tofore\nthat he gaf it vp / he lyeng in hys be&dtail; with a woman\nhys concubine named Alexaundryne / perceyued a\ngrete & horryble serpent in the myddes of the Chambre,\nwherof he was gretly abasshed & sore agast / and wol&dtail;\nhaue take the swer&dtail; to haue descharged it vpon the\nserpent / but Alexaundryne said thenne to hym in\nthis manyere: 'Ha, valyaunt Sersuel, how ofte haue\nI sene your mortal enemyes tofore your presence that\nneuer ye were afer&dtail;, and now for a serpent of femenyne\nnature ye shake for fere.  Wete it for trouth that this\nserpent is the lady of this place & she that edyfyed it /\nshe shal by no manere wyse hurt nor dommage you /\nbut so ferre I vnderstan&dtail; by her apparysshing that\nnedes ye shal hastly delyuere & gyue vp this Fortres\nto the Duc of Berry' / And morouer said the said\nSersue&llbar; to my said lord that hys Concubyne fered\nnothin&gtee; the serpent / but that he was neuer in his\ndayes so afer&dtail;.  And that he sawe thenne the sai&dtail;\nserpent tourned in to a fourme of a woman clothed in\na gowne of Cours clot&hbar; & gyrded with a grete corde\nvndernethe the pappes of her / and soone after tourned\nherself in the figure of a serpent and so vanysshed\naway. Also there was a man named godart dwellyng at\nthat tyme within the said Fortresse, whiche affermed for a trouth / and sware to my forsaid lord\nvpon the holy euaungilles that many tyme he had sene\nvpon the walles of the fortres the said serpent, and\nthat he had passed oftymes nygh her without receyuyng\nof ony harme.  Then another also called Yuon of\nWalles sware his feyth vnto my said lord that thre\ndayes tofore the reducyon of the said Fortresse made\nby the said Sersue&llbar; into the handes of my said lord,\n\u00feat he sawe an horryble grete serpent vpon the\nbatelments of the donjon of the said Castel of\nLusynen.  And many other also had the vision and syght of her. / And where it is soo that at thinstaunce requeste\nand prayer of my said lord haue be examyned\nmany prynces and dyuerse o\u00feer for the makyng &\ncompilacion of this present hystorye vpon the said\nmatere.  And also I haue putte my self to myn\nvtermost power to rede & loke ouer the Cronykles &\nmany bokes of auncyent hystoryes, to thende that I\nmight knowe the trouth of the forsaid matere.\nTherfore yf I haue wryton or shewe&dtail; ony thing that to som\nsemeth neyther possible to be nor credible, I beseche\nthem to pardonne me.  For as I fele & vnderstan&dtail; by\nthe Auctours of gramaire & phylosophye they repute\nand hold this present hystorye for a true Cronykle &\nthinges of the fayry.  And who that saith the contrary /\nI say the secret jugements of god and his\npunysshments are inuysible & impossible to be vnderstand or\nknowe by the humanyte of man./  For the\nvnderstanding of humayne Creature is to rude to vnderstande the\nspyce espirytuel, & may not wel comprehen&dtail; what it\nis / but as ferre as the wylle of god wyl suffre hym.\nFor there is found in many hystoryes Fayries that\nhaue be marye&dtail; & had many children / but how this\nmay be the humayn creature may not conceyue.  For\nthese poynts and suche other god hath reteyned \u00feem\nin his secrets.  And the more that the personne is of\nrude entendement the ferther is he fro knowlege of\nit.  And he that is replet of scyence naturel, the rather\nsha&llbar; haue affection to byleue it.  Notwithstandyng no\ncreature humayn may not obteyne the secrets of\ngod./ how be it saint paule saith in hys epystles to the\nRommayns, 'that al thinges ben knowen by humayn\nCreature' / but the glose reserueth & excepteth the\nsecrets of god.  For the kynde of man is to vnderstand\nthe ferther that he trauaylleth in reaumes and Countrees /\nthe greter knowleche hat&hbar; he of euery thinge / than he\nthat resteth in his owne Countre and neuer remevyth.\nAnd semblable wyse this historye is more credible for\nas moche as it is not auctorised by one man only / but\nalso by many noble Clerkes.  Now of this proces I wyl\nmake no ferther mencion / but humbly I beseche you\nand alle them \u00feat sha&llbar; here or rede this hystorye /\nthat yf there be ony thing that be nuyouse or\ndesplaysaunt to you / wyl pardonne me & hold me\nescusid.  For yf a man dooth as wel as he can / he ought to be\naccepted.  For in som cas the good wylle of a man\nis accepted for the dede./  And here I, Johan of Aras,\nende the hystorye of Lusynen / beseching god of his\nhygh mercy to gyue to \u00feem that be passed fro this\nmorta&llbar; world hys eterna&llbar; glorye / and to them that be\nlyuyng, prosperous and blessidfu&llbar; endyng./ [Here fynyssheth the noble hystorye of Melusyne.]"}, "sourceLink": "http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/browse.html", "fname": "./sgml/Melusine.sgm", "originalTitle": "Melusine.
