Many speken of men that romaunces rede Erasure of two or three letters between that and romaunces , and of one letter after rede . That were sumtyme doughti in dede, The while that god hem lyff lente, That now ben dede and hennes wente: Off Bevis, Gy, and of Gauwayn, Off kyng Richard, & of Owayn, Off Tristram, and of Percyuale, Off Rouland Ris, and Aglauale, Off Archeroun, and of Octouian, Off Charles, & of Cassibaldan, Off Hauelok, Horne, & of Wade;\u2014 In Romaunces that of hem ben made That gestoures often dos of hem gestes At Mangeres and at grete ffestes. Here dedis ben in remembraunce In many fair Romaunce; But of the worthiest wyght in wede That euere by-strod any stede, Spekes no man, ne in romaunce redes Off his batayle ne of his dedis. Off that batayle spekes no man, There alle prowes of knyghtes be-gan; That was for-sothe of the batayle That at Troye was saunfayle. Off swyche a fyght as ther was one, In al this world was neuere none, Ne neuere schal be til domysday\u2014 With-oute drede, I dar wel say;\u2014 Ne neuere better men born ware, Then were \u00fean a-sembled thare; Neuere was, ne neuere schal be So many gode men at asemble\u2014 I dar wel say, be my ffay,\u2014 As were at that batayle of Troy. \u00b6 This sign is in blue paint, and so they are everywhere else in this MS. For ther were, In that on side, Sixti kynges and dukes of pride, And sythen mo of gret feute, With alle thaire folk and thaire meyne; And ther was the beste bodi in dede That euere &yogh;it wered wede, Sithen the world was made so ferre, That was Ector, in eche a werre, Ne that neuere sclow so many bodies\u2014 Fyghtyng In feld with his enemyes\u2014 Off worthi men that doughti were, As duke Ector of Troye there; For ther was neuere man that myght stand A strong stroke of Ectores hand, That he ne deyed In that stounde With his dynt and falle to grounde, But the strong Achilles, That was best of alle that pres Off the kynde of Gregeys, As &yogh;e schal here how it weys. This capital is in blue and red paint, and so they are everywhere else in the MS. HErkenes now, and &yogh;e may here The werre sothe alle plenere: What was the forme enchesoun, The formest skyl and resoun, That alle the kynges of Grecis formast Inued And the Troyens so longe pursued; And how the batayle was first be-gunnen, And how Troye was sithen y-wonnen; And\u2014as the storie here beris recorde\u2014 Alle the dedis of euery lorde, And alle the dayes that thei faught there, And alle the dedis as thei were Of alle the lordes that ther faught, And whiche of hem here dethe \u00feer laught; \u00b6 And how fele termes and trewes Where take be-twene Troyens and Gruwes, And how longe euery trewe laste, And how thai spedde when thei were paste; And alle here wo and al here breste; And how many tymes that thei reste With-Inne ten &yogh;ere that thei were thore, Er that the toun distroyed wore. \u00b6 Dares, the heraud of Troye, sais, \u00b6 Dares The sign in blue, the name in red paint. .

Here the last three stand in the left margin in MS. . And turned it of Grew into Latyn, And wrot it faire in parchemyn In the manere as I schal telle. Hende, now herken to my spelle! IN the lond of Thesalye\u2014 As telles vs the right storie\u2014 Was sumtyme a noble kyng, Riche of kyn and other thyng, That het Polleus, whil he hadde lyff, \u00b6 Rex Polleus The signs in blue, the names in red paint; and so always. Here the last three stand in the left margin in MS. . And Tetes het the qwene his wyff. On here gat he that doughti knyght In wedlac, that Achilles hight, That wondir wrought and gret meruayle Afftirward in Troye batayle. \u00b6 This Polleus hadde an eldur brother, That higthe Eson, he het non other. Eson was so lad with elde, \u00b6 Rex Eson The signs in blue, the names in red paint; and so always. Here the last three stand in the left margin in MS. . That he ne myght his hondes welde: He toke Polleus al Thesaly With alle the Rentes and seygnory For to gouerne and for to &yogh;eme, And bad alle him serue to queme, For thei schulde be in his pouste; For he was blynd and my&yogh;t nou&yogh;t se. That blynde kynge, that het Eson, \u00b6 Jason ffilius Eson The signs in blue, the names in red paint; and so always. Here the last three stand in the left margin in MS. . Hadde a sone, that het Iason, Strong, sturne, stalworthe & stoute, Off speche curtays, of contenaunce deuoute, Large of &yogh;ifftes and [ryght] ffre, Wondur fair and ryght tempere. Alle the lordes of that lond Seruede that child to fote & hond For his prowes and his noblay, And loued him wel and quemed ay; \u00b6 Insula Colkos. Thai dede him as gret reuerence As Polleus kyng in his presence; The lordis and alle the comunalte Held that [child] child is not in the MS., but there is no blank either. In gret cherte. \u00b6 Polleus hadde wel gret envye That men dede him suche seruagery; He was aferd in his herte: If that child &yogh;ede forth In querte, And afftirward my&yogh;t falle gret toyle, And of that lond he wolde him spoyle; For he was gret of wasselage And loued with alle his baronage. Night and day the kyng then thought, How he my&yogh;t brynge that child to nought With sum sley&yogh;te priuily, That he were not schent ther-by. \u00b6 So longe he that a-boute sought MS. that caste a-boute sought ; perhaps caste aboute was the original, and our copyist tried to amend the rhyme aboute : thought by inserting sought , but forgot to cancel the caste ; sechen about occurs again l. 1687. , That it come thus in his thought, Off a wondur selcouthe gile To him by-traye that ilke while: He thought sende that ilke childe To Colkas,\u2014that perilous Ilde, That was so fer out in the est,\u2014 To wynne that schepe, that wondur best, That neuere man In come and &yogh;ede a-gayn Out of that Ile for-sothe vn-sclayn. Therfore ther-at I most dwelle, The manere of that Ile to telle. BE-&yogh;onde the lond of Troye, gode men,\u2014 I trowe: of Iorneys more than ten\u2014 Ther was an Ile that het Colkos, That alle the fyght of Troye by ros; As I schal schewe by what skylle, When my matere comes ther-tille. These 'signatures' are all by a later hand. The comune sawe was thorow alle Grece: Ther was a schepe that bar a flece With-In that Ile, that was of gold, That neuere man that was on mold With strengthe, my&yogh;te, ne with gynne That ilke schepe myght not wynne; That schepe was y-kepid The k altered from l ; cp. l. 743. day & ny&yogh;t With Marc&yogh;, a MS. as. god of mykel my&yogh;t. Who-so wolde that schepe come to, Many thinges he most do: He most ferst fyghte with strong nete That were hidous & wondir grete, And out of here mouth thei keste fir And brende men [&] here atir; And whan he hadde the nete ouercomen, That thei were mate and alle be-nomen, Ther lay a plow MS. aplow. with alle \u00fee gere,\u2014 And make hem drawe and that lond ere, He moste &yogh;oke hem in that plow, The bestes bolde\u2014if that he mow\u2014 And make hem drawe and ere that lond And holde that plow faste with his hond, Til it were ered thorow and thorow. Whan he hadde turned eche eche partly erased in MS. a forow, \u00b6 He most fyght with a dragoun And scle him, if he may or kun; The dragoun was gret and meruelous, Off sight & body ful hidous; No man wiste non suche by north ne be southe, He keste brondes of fir out of his mouthe,\u2014 Ther was none suche In no land\u2014 Ther my&yogh;t no man his hete with-stand. The brennyng brondes \u00feat from him wente Brende men In here garnement; Off thei were armed neuere so wel, He brend hem thorow Iren & stel.

By these periles and other mo Sicurly by-houes him to go, That wolde that schepe wynne or haue; Ther was neuere non that my&yogh;t him saue From these bestes and fro here hete, That he ne Inserted by a later hand over the line. scholde sone his lyf lete. \u00b6 When Pelleus was be-thought of this, He was Ioyful and glad y-wys, He thou&yogh;t egge Iasoun ther-tille Thedur to go on his fre wille; And so my&yogh;t he be most blameles And of his deth be holden giltles; For were he Inserted by a later hand over the line. went \u00feidur fro home, He hoped neuere of his gayn-come. PElleus kyng send fer & ner Bothe Corour and Messanger Thorow his lond and bad hem crie That he wolde a Mangerie, A riche feste and a riale, And thedur schulde come gret & smale; He sente his lettres and his sond Afftir alle the grete of the lond,\u2014 To Erle, lord, and bold baroun,\u2014 And bad hem come to his toun, For ther wolde he his feste holde With ladies bry&yogh;t and kny&yogh;tes bolde. Whan thei were comyn, thei were alle glad With moche merthe that thei mad, Til thre dayes were fulli paast, This Mangeri then so longe so longe substituted for, and written (by the later hand) above atte ; atte is crossed out. laast. Pelleus kyng then\u2014soth to say\u2014 Be-fore the lordes of that contray Spak to Iason, ther he stode Barehed with-outen hode,\u2014 He spak to him with fair semblaund, With louely chere and speche smyland; But it was fals and foule disseite, For he him be-thou&yogh;te thanne wel streite. \u00b6 He seide: 'Iason, my dere Cosyn, Thow art the beste kny&yogh;t of al my kyn, The worthiest man, the beste kny&yogh;t; I loue the wel\u2014and that is ry&yogh;t\u2014 For I am douted and eke dred Off kyng & kny&yogh;t and less MS. lest . mys-bed Be the alone and thi prowes Then by my lond and my riches.

And &yogh;it I hope\u2014so haue I roo,\u2014 If thow woldest &yogh;eue the ther-too And put ther-to thi bysynes, Thow scholde it haue with-oute distresse. Then were thow kny&yogh;t of worschepe most Off alle that wones in any cost, If \u00feow that flees with prowesse hadde; Then were I, Cosyn, of the gladde, For gret honour then dedest thow to me, And ther-by schuldest honoured be; And my lond afftir my day Schulde be thyn\u2014as I say,\u2014 And also in my lyff treuly Thow schulde be lord as wel as I, And haue thi wille and thi comandement Off alle that euere to me apent.' IAson stode In his emys halle By-fore his Eme and lordes alle, He herkened alle that he euere MS. he euere he. sayd, With his wordes he was wel payd; The wordes ri&yogh;t wel to him liked, He wist nou&yogh;t that he was beswiked, He wende not the wordes that were spoken Of him so to be a-wroken, But for he scholde wynne gret loos And be \u00fee more drad of his foos. He wiste wel if he seide 'nay' By-fore the lordes, that he schulde ay Holde him for a coward MS. acoward. And neuere-more of him take reward, But hope it were for cowardise That he durst not take a prise MS. aprise. . \u00b6 Iason seide: 'so mote I thriue, This feste schal neuere be don so blyue, That I ne schal be redi to go In-to that Ile, for wele or wo, What-so-euere schal be-tyde; I schal not longe thenne abyde, If it be so &yogh;e wil me fynde That nedeful is to mannes kynde: \u00b6 A strong schippe MS. schi\u00fe. , and vitayles good, And other thynges that me by-hood, And worthi kny&yogh;tes In my companye, That proued ben In chyualrie. And I, my lord, to the schal brynge That golden flece, that worthi thynge, If I may wynne it with doughtinesse, Or any man with hardinesse.' \u00b6 When Pelleus herde his Cosyn speke, He wiste wel his othe he wolde not breke; He was Ioyful in his mod, He sais: 'Cosyn and al my blod! As thow art, my Cosyn, thi-self alone, Is non so strong of body ne bone; I schal fulfille al thy lykyng That thow hast nede In any thyng And nedeful is in that viage; The worthiest of my baronage For-sothe, Cosyn, schal wende with the; A strong schip schal ordeyned be, It schal be mad that &yogh;ow may bere, That the see do &yogh;ow no dere, That in the water &yogh;e ben not spilt; Al thyng schal be as thow wilt.' PElleus kyng was wonder blythe. A strong schip was mad swythe, Strong & wyde and wondir large, With his boot and his barge; The schippe that he made to Iason Afftir the wright was cleped 'Argon.' Whan it was mad with seyl and mast, Thei hyed hem to fille it fast,\u2014 With Mete and drynke it is wel frau&yogh;t,\u2014 And worthi kny&yogh;tes with him be-tau&yogh;t; To wende with him in his fere, Many a dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t was there. \u00b6 Among whiche was Ercules, The strongest kny&yogh;t that euere wes, That in that world was \u00feanne levand; No man my&yogh;t his strok with-stand. This was he that men of speke, In erthe was non so my&yogh;ti freke, Kyng, ne kny&yogh;t, ne Champioun, In Ile, ne in regioun, That my&yogh;t with-stande that kny&yogh;tes strengthe The mountans of a dayes lengthe. \u00b6 This was he that strong man That al the world speke of can; He caste alle men that he wrasteled with, Were thei neuere so strong of lith. And Atthenes, the gode kny&yogh;t, He wrasteled with him with al his my&yogh;t, And Hercules him so hard thrist, That alle his ribbes al to-brast. This was he that in his dayes In batayles hard and gret affrayes He sclow geauntes with-outen tale, He wroght amonges hem gret bale; He sclow champiouns with-outen nombre, So manye that no man my&yogh;t hem vmbre. This was he that ilke kny&yogh;t, That was so strong & of so moche my&yogh;t. \u00b6 De Iasone. What schulde I speke more of his dedis? Eche man that of him redis Wot wele he was with-outen pere, Whil that he was lyuande here; I leue \u00feer-fore and turne eft A-gayn to Iason ther-as I left. THis schippe was redi and set on-flote With his barge & his bote; Iason takis his leue to wende At Pelleus & at other frende; Hercules schal with him go. Ther-of schal rise al this wo, That Troie schal so foule be for-don, As I schal telle &yogh;ow sone. Thei are schepped now eche a wyght, The schip is &yogh;are & redi dight, Ther sail is drawe, the[i] wende forth faste, In-to the see thei ben forth paste. Thei sailen many a day and ny&yogh;t With many stormes lyght, Til thei were weri of the see; Thei wolde fayn at reste be: Vpon a day the mariner Saw a lond that was hem ner; Ther schip thei turned thedir prest, For on that lond to take here rest. Vpon that lond thei lepe vp alle, An[d] of ther teld thei made an halle, And ete & drank & made hem glad; Thei were fayn that thei lond had. The lond that thei were on lyght, The lond of Troye that tyme hight; Troie was not that tyme so strong, Ne so moche, ne so long, \u00b6 De Rege Lamedonie Troiani. Wyde, ne large, ne no-thyng toward, As it was sethen afftirward When Priamus hit made a-&yogh;eyn, When Lamedon, his fadir, was sclayn. \u00b6 The Greges hade seten but a stounde And made hem merie on the grounde, Or hit were told to Lamedon That men were lyght his lond vpon, Stout, & fers, and full gay, That wel be-semed of gret noblay; Thei wende thay wold hem robbe in hast, Or brenne that lond and leue it wast; Thei sayde: \"it were good to wete here wille, Whether thei were comen for good or ille;\"\u2014 'And bidde hem go and rise And voyde this lond, if thei be wyse; Or &yogh;e schal hem honge and drawe, If thei dwelle til the day dawe. \u00b6 Lamedon called a gret lordyng, Wyse of speche & of beryng, And bed him go to hem anon, And take with him men gret won And bidde hem wende out of his lond, Or he wol reue hem foot and hond. \u00b6 This riche lord his hors hath hent And to the Gregeys he is went, And seyde: 'lordynges, so god me mende, Lamedon me to &yogh;ow sende, Oure kyng, and seys: him meruayles What &yogh;e thenken and what &yogh;ow ayles, Vpon his lond that &yogh;e aryue; And biddes &yogh;ow hye hennes blyue, That &yogh;e be not founden here to-morwen; For &yogh;if &yogh;e ben, &yogh;e be for-lorn. He wil &yogh;ow hewe lym and lythe, &YOGH;if he to-morwe may mete &yogh;ow withe. Voydes this lond and dos be my red,\u2014 Or sekirly &yogh;e ben alle ded!' \u00b6 Iason was al a-stonaid Off that \u00fee kny&yogh;t thus to him said, He turned to his felawes ward: 'This kyng sais vs an ille forward To voyde his lond with-outen gilt, Or we schal elles alle be spilt; For-sothe he nys not curtays To vncouthe men that resten in pes In his lond vpon a brynke MS. abrynke. ,\u2014 That non ille do, ne non harm thenke, But reste vs here on this ryuage,\u2014 To sende vs suche a message MS. amessage. . But I se wel he loues vs litel That hates vs by suche a titel MS. atitel. , For we vpon his lond reste r corrected from l. ; He loues litel an vncouthe geste.' IAson thenne with heuy chere Turned him to the messangere; He sayde: 'lordying, I herde wel Al thi message euery del.

Say him: \"he has be-gunnen a strif, That he and his schal rewe his lyf\"; And bidde him be sekir her-of & bold, And say that I him thus told!' \u00b6 Hercules his lippes gnowe For tene he hadde not folk y-nowe, That he als-tide and sir Iason Might not ffyght with Lamedon.

Sche hadde here herte so on him set, Here eye my&yogh;t sche not fro him let; Sche loued him so wondirly tho, That sche wiste neuere what to do, But toke here leue and be-gan to go To the chambur that sche come fro. \u00b6 Vnto the chambur sche is comyn, Loue hath here so vndir-nomyn, That trauayles here wondir strong With thought and sykyng euere among; Sche thenkith bothe day & ny&yogh;t How sche that loue performe my&yogh;t With-outen schame and vylonye, That sche were not reproued ther-by; Fayn sche wolde haue here wille, But sche my&yogh;t not come ther-tille. \u00b6 And thus leued sche fourtene ny&yogh;th In gret wo as any wy&yogh;th: Til hit be-fel vpon a day That kyng Cetes\u2014soth to say\u2014 And Iason were to-gedur set And bad here men Medee doun fet In-to the halle of his paleis, To talke with the kny&yogh;tes curteis.

And he bad here sitte be Iason,\u2014 That al here loue was vpon,\u2014 And speke with him In fair manere, As Mayden schulde to bachelere. Medee did his comaundement; But Cetes was ther-with ablent: He wist not of Medee wille That sche loued Iason stille. \u00b6 When Iason saw that worthi wyght So sitte on benche by him right, He was wel glad, as him gon thenk; Ercules ros vp of the benk, And he sat be that worthi wenche To wete what that mayden dede thenke. \u00b6 Kyng Cetes with-oute doute Spak to the kny&yogh;tes him aboute, Of Ercules asked tydynges, At other kny&yogh;tes of other thynges; So to him &yogh;af no man gome, Kny&yogh;t ne sqwyer, lord ne grome.

MEdee is vnto here chambre gone, And here maydenes euerychone. Here thought longe vnto nyght, That sche my&yogh;t speke with that kny&yogh;t.

That faire lady, that louesom brid, A Craffty cofre sche vn-did And toke out an ymage, frely dyght With fele torches and mochel lyght, That MS. Ther. sacrid was In Iouis name. 'Iason,' seide that faire dame, 'Thow schalt thin hond on this god lay And thow schalt holde that I schal say: On this ymage thow schalt swere, Faith & treuthe thow schalt me bere, And wedde me to thy wyff, And leue me neuere whil I haue lyff.' \u00b6 Iason sayde: 'my trewthe I layd, To do al as thow hast sayd.' And layde his treuthe on that ymage To MS. And. take here the terme of his age. When sche hadde take of him that oth, Thei caste of hem euery cloth \u00b6 Iason concubuit cum Medee.

And afftir that Medee out hente A wel riche oynemente And an-oynted alle his body, Visage and alle witterly: For hit for-did al brennyng of ffire, Off hit brende neuere so schire. \u00b6 And afftirward that fair swetyng By-tau&yogh;t Iason a riche MS. ariche. ryng, That alle venym for-dede & strued,\u2014 That he schul not be venym-noyed That bar that riche ryng on him: For it fordede alle venym. MEdee tok with him thanne a writ, And him bad he schuld bere it; And when he come with-Inne that Ile, That he schulde with herte mylde On his knees him doun sette, Er he that flece &yogh;ede to fette; And thries he scholde hit ouer-rede; That he ne lefft for no drede. \u00b6 Sche toke him thenne a riche MS. ariche. licour,\u2014 A viole ful of gode sauour,\u2014 And bad he schulde that lycour poure, When he come In-to the stoure, In the mouthes of the neete, For hit was wondur cleuand wete; Then scholde thei holde here mouth to-gedur And make no more so foule a wedur:\u2014 'For if thow konne this in here mouthe throwe, Thei schal no more no fir blowe!' \u00b6 Iason seide: 'I thonk it the, That thow hast thus ordeyned for me! I hope, or it be euenyng, That golden flece to the bryng.' He toke his leue at that may, In-to his Chambre he tok the way, Ther-In he lay and Hercules; Wel stille he lay doun in pes, Til it was cler day and lyght, That the sunne schon wel bryght: He ros vp and come him doun, And alle his felawes enviroun. OVt of his bed is Iason rysen, To wende his way he is not grysen, To wynne the schepe,\u2014if he haue grace,\u2014 Now he these thinges of Medee has. He is comyn in-to the halle With Hercules and his men alle; To Cetes the kyng he is forth went. He asked anon, what it be-ment, He asked at him and at hisen, Whi he was so erly rysen. 'Sir,' he saide, 'be godis ore! That I thus dwelle me rewes sore; I wol ther-fore make asay To wynne the flece\u2014if I may:\u2014 &YOGH;eue me leue and lete me go, That I no lenger be ther-fro.' \u00b6 Cetes saide: 'I haue gret drede, That thow be dede and not wel spede; I schal therfore haue harm and schame, For men wol rette on me the blame; But that thow art of wil so bold, That I may not at home the hold\u2014 God, that this world made round, Brynge the a&yogh;eyn hol and sound!' \u00b6 Then was Iason wondir blythe, He toke his armure and tyred him swythe, \u00b6 Qualiter Iason fecit bellum. And &yogh;ede forth the schepe to wynne To that Ile that he was Inne. When he was comen ther it was, Ther he schulde ouer the water pas In-to that Ile In-to a bote MS. abote. , He kest his armes In fote hote And rowed ouer with an ore. When he was ouer that watur thore, He armed him\u2014as he coude wele\u2014 Bothe in Iren and in stele, And on his hed thanne sette His trewe and trusti basenette, And kest his scheld a-boute his hals, And bere his spere with him als; And &yogh;af aboute him ful good kepe, If he my&yogh;t be war of the schepe. And thedirward Iason him drow, To wynne the flece\u2014if he mow. IAson is now on londe lyght, Armed wel and nobly dyght. When he was comen to that stede, Ther he saw the schepes trede, On the first thenne was he ware, Where the nete were standyng thare, Kestyng fir with-oute sese Of her mouthe with-oute relesse, That alle the sky with-oute doute Was on fire alle a-boute. But he thought then on his swetyng, Of dame Medee and her kennyng: Ful radly thenne the boyste he hent That was with the oynement; Al his visage and his face Anoynted ther-with sone he hase. He toke also that ymage bry&yogh;t That was of siluer made & dy&yogh;t, And hanged it aboute his hals a-boue,\u2014 As Medee him bad do so for here loue,\u2014 And turned it to the fir anon, And the nete stood and loked ther-on; And sette him doun meke & wyse And redde his writ thanne thryse, And when it was thries red, To go to hem was not dred. His perel thanne a-wey was rau&yogh;t, And with this nete faste he fau&yogh;t: The flaume of fir thenne on him caste And brende his gode scheld on haste, And his spere to his hond To coles hit fel vpon the sond. HE toke thenne that licour wete And poured qwyk into the nete; And when it was with-Inne ther r by a later hand. lippes, Faste to-gedur hit hem grippes, That thei my&yogh;t not her mouth vn-spere, With hete Iason no more to fere. When Iason hem thus discomfit Thorow dame Medee that was perfit, And saw a-boute that the aire Was good and clene and ful fair, And the nete myght fyght no more Thorow here kennyng and here lore, He toke hem be the hornes long And here hedes a-boute wrong, And loked, if thei were tame ynow, And ladde hem thanne vnto the plow, And &yogh;oked hem and dede hem drawe, And turned that lond with-outen awe. When he hadde don, he toke his way To the dragoun ther he lay; And the dragoun sey him ney, He made thanne an MS. and. hidous cry, And hissed loude, and brondes blew, Fyr faste on Iason he threw, And spitte venym and keste aboute; But Iason ther-of hadde no doute: Whan he herde that how loude he hissed, Iason dede as he was wissed, He toke the ryng that sche toke him For drede of fir & of venym,\u2014 That bare a stone MS. astone. , was fair and grene,\u2014 And held hit sone hem be-twene, And keste it doun be-fore his syght. And whan the dragoun saw that lyght MS. lyght , altered from syght. , He lefte the fir and his brennyng And al foule venym of his spittyng, And loked stabli on that ston, And he beheld euere ther-on, And whil the dragoun ther-to &yogh;aff tent, His swerd Iason out hent And smot the hed fro the bouke, And the ryng with him toke MS. toke , altered from boke. And in hold he gan hit do. And when he hadde sclayn him so, He wente\u2014and so he my&yogh;t wele\u2014 And drow his tethe out of his chavele, And sewe hem thanne vpon the land That he hadde ered on that sand. Armed men of hem ther sprong, And echon on other faste dong, Til alle were sclayn that were thore; On lyue leffte there none wore. \u00b6 When Iason saw that ther was an ende Off alle that wondir enchauntemende, Toward the schepe be-gan he go With-oute drede him to sclo: With bothe his handes the schepe he sclow, And fro the body the skyn he drow, And bare with him that schepes skyn With mochel Ioye & mochel wyn, Til he come to his bote; And lepe In with a merie MS. amerie. note, And ouer to his felawes rode, Ther Hercules him a-bode,\u2014 Wondir blythe, Ioyful, and glad That thei on lyue him had. \u00b6 Iason thenne and his Gregeis Rode to Cetes & to his paleis; When Cetes saw that Ioyful kyng Iason that schepes skyn bryng, He hadde ther gret envy That he raff him that drury; But euel semblant my&yogh;t he non make For Hercules and Iason sake, But dede hem sitte by his side And fair semblaunt made him that tyde. Then come &yogh;ong and old The schepes skyn to be-hold, Thei hadde of Iason gret meruayle, How he it wan in batayle A&yogh;ens thair goddis wil and my&yogh;t; Thei hadde meruayle of suche a kny&yogh;t. IAson now the flece hath wonne, The tydynges thorow the Cete is ronne, Many a man come him to see, Ther he was set by dame Medee. He dwellyd ther a ful mon[i]the Cf. ll. 1686 and 9407. , And Hercules kyng Cetes withe,\u2014 And til a tyme that he & sche, And Hercules and his meyne, Stale away with-Inne a ny&yogh;t And &yogh;ede to schepe by sterre ly&yogh;t; And drow vp sail, and scheped sone, And wente hom forth by the mone. The wynd be-gan to rise & to blowe And brou&yogh;t hem home in a throwe To the lond of Thesalye, Iason and his companye. \u00b6 The word was told to Pelleus blyue b perhaps altered from v. \"That Iason was comen hom alyue, And how he hadde brou&yogh;t in-to Grece\"\u2014 'For-sothe' thei seyden\u2014\"the golden flece.\" Wo was him of tho tythandis: He wrong to-gedir bothe his handes For sorwe and wo and care of herte, That he was comen home in qwerte. But when he saw him comande, He wente a-&yogh;eyn him with fair semblande, And welcometh him wel home, And was glad of his come, And thonked god that he ferd wele, And &yogh;af him the lond, eche a dele Off Thesalye that lond aboute, So he be-het him, or he wente oute. \u00b6 With this lond was he not payd; He wolde be venged algate\u2014he sayd\u2014 Off Lamedone, the kyng of Troyene, For he him dede reproue and tene. To Hercules wel offte he spake: \"That he that charge wolde take; \u00b6 Hic Incipit Bellum. For elles my&yogh;t it not come to ende;\"\u2014 'For thow hast many a noble frende, Many a kny&yogh;t MS. akny&yogh;t. , and many a kyng, And wil be fayn at thi byddyng.' Hercules seyde: 'ne drede the nou&yogh;t! Ful wel to ende it schal be brou&yogh;t To my worschepe, if my lyf last, Or this &yogh;ere be ful past. Haue thow no care, ne make no mone! But let me here with-al alone! I schal so venge oure vilonye, That thay schal ful sore abye.' HErcules the charge hath tane; He thenkes to be that kynges bane, He thenkes him scle with his hond, If he may come to his lond. At hom is he no lenger wol he erased after lenger. abiden, To Sportes is that kny&yogh;t reden,\u2014 That was a lond of Romanye altered from Romayne. ,\u2014 Ther two bretheren were were ought to be struck out. of chiualrye Regned Inne by ther dayes. Hercules ther the bretheren prayes To wende with him ouer the see, With armed folk a gret meyne, To venge him on kyng Lamedon, That kest him out and sir Iason Off his lond, whan thai hem reste, That dede him nother noye ne breste.

Castor hete that on brother, And Pollus called men that other. Hercules toke leue at hom And rode hym to Salom, A lond that was to Grece longand, That Thelaman thenne held held inserted by a later hand above the line. in his hand That was kyng of gret renoun, An hardy kny&yogh;t, a bold MS. abold. baroun.

A[nd] whan he come to Thesalye, He fonde a louely MS. alouely. companye Of kynges and kny&yogh;tes to-gedur thore, That for his help comen wore: For thanne was comen Thelaman, That dou&yogh;ti kyng, that noble man; And the bretheren bothe two, Castor kyng and Pollus also, With alle here men and here nauee Stondyng redi on the see; And Pelleus was al redi dy&yogh;t With many a bold baroun and kny&yogh;t; And here schippes were vitayled, Ther mete and drynke schal non be fayled. Consilium Grecorum contra Troianos This line is in red paint. . Alle the kynges bene now to-gedur, And hit was ful meri wedur: That Marche was passed and Feuerer, Hit was that tyme of the &yogh;ere, It was in-myddis of Averille; T[h]e wedir was clere, the wynd was stille.

CAstor kyng, that dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t, Is comen doun to that fy&yogh;t, To helpe Nestor, that worthi duk, That he se Troyens so rebuk.

BVt when Pollus saw that syght, The Gregeis were so discomfyght: With alle his men he thedur ran And sclow of the Troyens many a man. Many men was be-twene hem sclayn, When thei were alle on the playn To-gedur mette with thaire batayles; Eche man other ther assayles. \u00b6 But Lamedon saw, his men fau&yogh;t Ouer my&yogh;t and out of mau&yogh;t,\u2014 What with loue and what with awe,\u2014 A litel a-bak he made hem drawe And gedered hem alle on an hepe As a witti kyng, my&yogh;ti, and &yogh;epe. \u00b6 Duke Nestor aboue his scheld Lamedon that tyme be-held: He saw alle men do his byddyng, He hoped therfore, he was here kyng.

On duk Nestor In that dynt; He harmed him nou&yogh;t worth a thong MS. athong. , For his Armes were so strong, And elles hadde he ben sclayn With Lamedon on the playn. \u00b6 But Nestor on an-other wyse Smot Lamedon by-fore al hyse: He smot him on his scheld so That he cleue hit euen In-two, And bare him doun to the grounde And &yogh;af him there an hidous wounde; But he lepe vp with gret spede, When he was born thus fro his stede, And drow his swerd raply & smert\u2014 As hardi man and bold of hert\u2014 And made him romme aboute and way To duke Nestor\u2014the sothe to say. A Newe-made kny&yogh;t, that hy&yogh;te Cedar, Off Lamedon, his lord, was war Among that prese faught on fote; He thou&yogh;the to do ther-of gode bote b altered out of u. : He smot Nestor on his gold plate, That he &yogh;ede doun in-myddes the gate; He bar him fro his hors in fyght By-fore his lord, in the kynges syght. Whan Lamedon saw Nestor felde, He thoght his strok scholde be &yogh;elde That he &yogh;af him at her Iustyng: Lamedon, that worthi kyng, He hyed him faste to Nestor tho And &yogh;af strokes y-nowe and mo, He brak his coyfe and his ketil-hat, That to his hed sore it sat. He smot him so ryght in the face, That he hath lorn his solace; For he was ther so for-bled And with that kyng so ouerled, That he hadde dyed and ben for-don, Ne hadde him come socour son. \u00b6 But then come to that stour Many a Grek MS. agrek. to his socour And fro the kyng of Troye him reffte, And elles had he his lyff ther leffte; Out of the pres [thei] him ladde, For of his lyff were thei adradde. And Lamedon, that dou&yogh;ti man, A noble stede the whiles wan And lep vp qwyk with-oute fayle And strok forth in that batayle. \u00b6 Pollus brother, kyng Castor, Saw Cedar, that felde duke Nestor; Wo was him for that fallyng, He thou&yogh;th to make of him vengyng: He rode to him, as he were wode, Vpon a stede MS. astede. worth mechel gode. \u00b6 But ther be-fel another kny&yogh;t, That was of Troye, Secundam hy&yogh;t,\u2014 He was of Cedar blod and kyn, He was seker his ney cosyn,\u2014 He saw, how Castor wolde haue him smetyn Sydlyng, or he hadde weten, That wold he for non aw&yogh;t: Be-twene hem the strok he caw&yogh;t And brast on kyng Castor his spere; But he my&yogh;t not him doun bere, Castor spere was tow and strong,\u2014 Ther was non strenger in al that throng;\u2014 He smot Secundam in the syde A gret wounde and a wyde MS. awyde. . WHen Cedar saw his Cosyn woundid, He was for del al confounded: With drawen sword\u2014as a wode man\u2014 Cedar thanne to Castor ran; Cedar than in that wode brayd On Castor so wonderly layd, That his helm al to-roffe, And his basenet to his hed droffe. He wounded him in his visage For his ffoly and his outrage, That hit in alle his lyff was sene,\u2014 And feld him doun vpon the grene; And his stede from him cau&yogh;t And his sqwyer him by-tau&yogh;t. \u00b6 Now Castor is from his hors born, His stede was taken and fro him lorn; Opon his fete he stode and fau&yogh;t, Many a strok MS. astrok.

He ferde as he hadde y-raued, So fayn he wolde his brother haue saued. He rod thanne al aboute To his fomen with gret route, And amonges hem [made] ful gret pay; To his brother he made him way, And halp him fro his foos hondes, And felde Troyens on the sondes, And brou&yogh;t to Castor the Troyes stede, And halp him vp at his gret nede. POlleus kyng brende as the fyr For gret wratthe, onde & ir MS. hir. , That he had so his brother dyght And warisched him of his myght. He saw a kny&yogh;t agayn him\u2014 His name was Eliachim, The kynges sone Sartaginis, And Lamedon Cosyn also y-wys\u2014 He smot the kny&yogh;t with al his my&yogh;t Ryght be-fore the kynges sy&yogh;t, That he died be-fore his eyen With mechel wo and mechel pyn. \u00b6 Kyng Lamedon that be-held His cosyn dyed In the feld, &YOGH;eld the gost be-fore him there, He wepte for him ful many a tere MS. atere. . He sette his horn to his mouthe And blew thries, as he wel couthe; When he hadde blowen the thridde blast, The kny&yogh;tes come aboute him fast, Thei asked him, what him was; Lamedon saide to hem: 'alas! Se &yogh;e not my cosyn dere Lye be-fore me ded here, The kynges sone of Artage? Pollus sclow him In his rage. Now with alle the myght that &yogh;e konne Venge now my sistir sone!' \u00b6 When Lamedon hadde thus spoken Off his fomen to be wroken, Among the Grues then he presed And sclow many, or he sesed: He bare kynges and lordes doun Off gret prise and gret renoun; The Troyens then sclow the Grues, That thei for wo chaunged thaire hewes; Thei were wounded and sore ybete, For thei were so ouersete, Thei fledde a-way and lefft here place; The Troyens thanne hem gon chace And droff hem to the sees bank, And hewes of hem armes & schank. The Gruwes for-sothe hadde deye[d] alle\u2014 So wo that tyme hem was by-falle With gret wo and encomber MS. encombrer. \u2014 Ne hadde ther come a messanger MS. amessanger.

WHan Lamedon these tydynges herde, With Mechel del thenne he ferde; Lord god! what him was wo! For he wiste neuere wheder to go. But at the laste his horn he blew, And his good men that him knew Come aboute him wondur blyue, As faste as thei my&yogh;t driue. \u00b6 As thei reden to Troye ward, Thei saw come many a lord MS. alord. , Many Gryffons on a ffrape With mychel spede MS. speche. and mychel rape.

But for batayles ben euere in doute, And er that it be brou&yogh;t aboute, No man wote who schapis the better, I rede that we sende oure letter Or elles Message by som lordyng To hem of Grece that dide this thyng, To make a-mendes of thaire trespas That thei vs dede In this plas, Off that thei brende and doun threwe That we haue made a-&yogh;eyn newe, And that thei robbed so oure lond And sclow oure frendes with here hond. \u00b6 And &yogh;if thei nyl amendes make, Ne do so mochel for oure sake With any other amende, My sustir home that thei sende That thei holde ther in hordome, Me to vylany and to schome,\u2014 &YOGH;it scholde we thole her errour That thei haue don to vs & our, That ther be no more ado Be-twene hem & vs, if thei do so. And thus me thinke we may sum-dele Agayn men be excused wele.' \u00b6 Alle that euere sat and stode, Saide, \"his consail was gode;\" But thei seide, \"it most be A witti man to passe the see, That on this Message schuld go, That thei for wratthe dede him not sclo.\" The wisest man that thei had Was Antenor; the kyng him bad That he schulde on that erande wende, To wete of hem alle the ende. \u00b6 Antenor dede the kynges byddyng: He dyght his schip with-oute dwellyng And spedde him faste on his viage, To do MS. To to do . the kynges gret message MS. gret me message . . So longe he sayled day and nyght, To Thesalye he come right, Ther Pelleus kyng dwelled than With Many a lord and many a worthi MS. aworthi . man. \u00b6 Hic Rex Troiani misit nuncium ad Regem Grecorum These two lines in red paint. . ANtenor on londe is lyght, Wel arayed and semely dyght; To Pelleus kyng he is now went And salued him faire verament. And he &yogh;ede faire to his gretyng And asked of him, \"what tithyng, Whennes he come, and what he was, And what made him the see to pas In-to contrays, and what he soughte?\" And bad that he schulde gabbe noughte. \u00b6 Antenor saide: 'sir, by the rode! To telle the sothe so me be-houede. I schal &yogh;ow telle ffor no Latyn, Off I schal therfore be sclayn\u2014 For I am sworen be myn othe, To say the sothe for leeff or lothe: \u00b6 I come on Message fro the kyng of Troye To &yogh;ow, sir kyng,\u2014so haue I ioye! The kyng of Troye to &yogh;ow me sende And asketh, whether &yogh;e wol amende In the MS. line 2001 after l. 2002! The harme, the schame, the vylony, The Mansclaughter and the robbery Off his fadir that &yogh;e sclow, And of good that &yogh;e fro him drow, And of his sustir Oxonie, That &yogh;e haue here In &yogh;oure balye And make that ladi an hore to be That is gentelour, then &yogh;e or he That holdes hir here on suche a manere MS. amanere . ? Sendes him home his sustir dere, And &yogh;it wol he alle other trespas For-&yogh;eue, when he hir at home has, And be in qwyete and in pees, And his fader deth relese And alle the good that &yogh;e haue of his, That no contake be-twene &yogh;ow ris.' WHen Pelleus kyng had herd this, He was angered for-sothe y-wys, With Priamus was he ful wroth; Fro Antenor a litel he goth, His mautalent to refrayne That dede his herte mochel payne For vilens wordes of Priamus. To Antenor thanne seyde he thus: He seyde, \"he nolde &yogh;eue a fecche, He holdes him certes but a wrecche\"\u2014 'And thow that hast these tythynges brou&yogh;t: By him that al this world hath wrou&yogh;t! But thow go with-oute dwellynge, In dispite of thi lord thi kynge I schal do the to vyle dethe With-oute consayle or other rede!' \u00b6 Antenor for ferd schoke, With-oute leue his way he toke Toward his schip wonder faste And sayled forth, til he were paste Out of his lond in-to the see Fer fro him In his contre. And sayled forth in his way Many a ny&yogh;th and many a day, Til he were comen to Salenne; A fair Cite ther was thenne, Ther Thelaman dwelled In That \u00feat Mayden held in syn. \u00b6 When Antenor herde that tythand, That Theleman was kyng of that land, Out of his schip to him he soughte; And asked, \"whether he wolde oughte With him that he aftir spired?\" With the Troye[n]s was he a-greued, For he wiste wel, if that thei my&yogh;th, Thei wolde him reue the worthi wy&yogh;th. \u00b6 Antenor sayde: 'sir, herkenes now! The kyng of Troye send me to &yogh;ow And bad &yogh;ow for &yogh;oure curtesye Sende him home dame Oxonye, Out of his lond that &yogh;e haue led, That neuere wolde that lady wed, But holde hir with &yogh;ow here As an hore and hores fere, That is come of more honour Than &yogh;e, sir kyng, and alle &yogh;our. And &yogh;if &yogh;e wole this so do, In pees may &yogh;e for him be so.' THelaman stode & these wordes herde, He swore by him that made this werlde: \"Out of his lond but if he hied, If he ther-Inne myght be spyed, He wolde him brynge In-to foule endyng For Priamus loue, that fals kyng;\"\u2014 'But say thi kyng, that me meruayles\u2014 That nyse Cokard\u2014what him ayles, Off loue or pees to praye me,\u2014 And MS. That . alle hise, him, and the, And alle that ben &yogh;ow toward; But say, that I make forward: He schal neuere haue that blisful birde, But he hir wynne with dynt of swerde; [I] wan that lady Oxonye At Troyes toun with Chiualrie. Say thi kyng: \"be no wayes I wol not do that he me prayes.\" But hye the faste out of my lond, Or thow schalt deye with myn hond!' ANtenor a-wey him spedde, Off Thelaman was he a-dredde; To his schip wel faste he &yogh;ede And sayled forth with gret spede, Til he come to Acayas; A worthi Cite thanne ther was, Ther Castor dwelled and kyng Pollus. When Antenor herde telle thus, That these bretheren bothe were In the toun to-gedur there, He come to hem and tolde his tale By-fore hem bothe in the sale. But sicurly the kynges bothe, When thei herde him speke, thei were wrothe; In gret wratthe spak Castor To the knyght sir Antenor, And bad him sese of his spekyng,\u2014 \"Or he schulde deye, be heuene kyng!\" \u00b6 He seyde: 'falawe, what-so thow art\u2014 He that made the come hidirward, I holde him a nyse MS. anyse . cokard, I wot no man of him a-ferd; A nyse MS. anyse . Iauel is he that the sendis, That we schal make him amendis Off alle thinges that is ydon, Or sende him hom his suster son. \u00b6 What wrecche is he that biddis vs thus, When we hate him and he hates vs? Vs is leuere werre than pees; We wol not, that he relees His fader dethe ne no-thyng elles,\u2014 As thow thi message here vs telles\u2014 For we dede his sire neuere suche schame, That we ne schal do to him the same! Other amendis wil we not make; But In his dispite and for his sake We schul do the to dethe vyle, Iff thow dwelle here any while!' ANtenor for wratthe wex al pale, With-oute leue a-way he stale, As faste as he my&yogh;th skippe; He toke the way to his schippe And sayled a-way to the see, For ther durst he no lenger bee. To wende for-sothe to ende his nedis, To Pilon faste the knyght him spedis; Ther duk Nestor the knyght be-held, And his erand as-tyde he teld. Duk Nestor was ful of wratthe and ire Toward Antenor, that proudely sire, That for tene chaunged alle his hewe: He wex &yogh;olow, bloo, and blewe. Antenor sees his colour meued, That he come there ful sore him rewed; He hoped neuere thenne to wende With-outen deth and schamely ende. Nestor sayde: 'thow seruaunt lythur, How artow so bold these wordes wethur To speke hem here in my presence, In my wratthe and myn offence? Certes! ne were my genterye, My fredom, and my curtesye, Thow scholdest not passe fro me on lyue: That I schulde thi chekis on-sundir dryue, Or I scholde In &yogh;oure kynges dispit Thi bodi with hors to-drawe hit Thorow-out my lond, and take vengeaunce Off thi proude wordis and contenaunce. But hye the faste of my sight, Or\u2014here my trowthe I the plight!\u2014 Thow schalt deye with mechel pyne, If thow dwelle longe in lond myne!' Antenor stale away fro him, He dredde to lese bothe lyff and lym; He stale to schipe and sayled a-way, For he dredde Nestor ay. He sayled forthe on his iornay, Til he come to Troie contray; Ther he fond manye on glade, For his come gret Ioye thei made. ANtenor is comen to Troye, Off his comyng thei made Ioye, Al that lond and that Cite. To Priamus as-tyde went he \u00b6 Hic Rex Troianorum iratus est. And told \"what answere that he hadde, And how the lordis alle him badde Out of here lond that he schulde ffle, Or he scholde honge on a tre MS. atre . , Or al to-drawe him lym fro lym In dispite forsothe of hym;\" 'For thei seyde alle by on sawe, Thei tolde right nau&yogh;t of thyn awe, For of thi loue kepe thei nought; Thi wratthe echon thay sette at nought. And thi sustir most be bought Wyth dynt of swerd, or thow getest hir nought.' WHen Priamus this vndir-stode, Wel coldful tho was his blode, Gret sorwe in his herte made, Ther myght no man that day him glade. Then was the kyng bothe wan and pale And sat doun stille In the sale; He was an-angred and greved, That Antenor was so repreued On his message a-monges the Grues; That he come ther, wel sore him rewes, And that thei set by him so lyght; He thoght be wreken, if he myght, Off here euel dedis and answeres, And so he wol, and so he sweres. Anon he dede afftir sende The grete of Troye that were hende, And spake thus to alle that wore Comen then to-gedir thore; He seide: 'lordynges, &yogh;e wot wel alle, That ben now sembled MS. semblent . In this halle, I sente message\u2014as &yogh;e me consayled, Ful wele I wende hit wolde avayled\u2014 To the kynges and lordes of Grece, That robbed &yogh;ow and this contrece, That Lamadon, my fader, sclow, And &yogh;oure kynrade to hem drow: If thei wolde amendes make For curtesye and for oure sake, That we myght In pes be so, That ther were no more a-do; Or if thei wold hit not amende, That thei wolde my sustir sende, And I and &yogh;e wold be In pes, And alle oure harmes make reles. But Antenor, oure Messager, Is come home, as &yogh;e se her; &YOGH;e haue alle herd of his tythynges, And what answere fro hem he brynges: Thei say thei haue of vs no drede, Thei wol non amendes bede; Ne my sustir\u2014the sothe to say\u2014 Fro hem wol thei not sende a-way, But holde hir there in feble herues In my dispite and my repreues. Now schal alle men on vs wondur, If we so foule schal be put vndur, That we no-wyse dar take vengaunce Off hem that dede vs this greuaunce, But sendes vs word: \"that hem liketh wele Of that thei dede eche a dele MS. adele . , And that thei greued vs neuere so sore, That thei wole greue vs more.\" Wolde it neuere god, that it were so Al that thei say thai myght do! For I holde vs now\u2014be my fay!\u2014 Better and strenger than thay, And we ben wel kynned and fyn, And haue a toun MS. atoun . wil vs tyn. \u00b6 Wherfore, lordes, me thynketh: gode wore That we sone strengthe kyd hem thore, That vs so foule hath reuyled. I wolde, that thei were be-gyled, As thei dede vs here of this toun, Whan thei brende hit & kest it doun. I wold, we sente ouer the see Men of Armes gret plente, That myght haue ryued vn-warned thore On some of hem, or thay were wore, And slee and robbe, brenne and reue Alle that thei founde, and no-thyng leue; Or if thei myght som ladi wynne, That comen were of gentil kynne, That we may holde in oure baylie In-stede of dame Oxonye.' \u00b6 The lordes ros vp alle that there ware, An[d] seide trewely: \"thei wold not spare Body ne good ne non other thyng, But al schulde be at his byddyng, His comaundement and his wille And of his fomen to fulfille.\" \u00b6 Then was Priamus wondur blythe, And thonked hem an hundred sythe. Thai toke here leue hom to go And toke hem leue on goddis half tho; And bad hem thenke on alle thyng To be euere redi at his sendyng. Alle the lordes ben home gone; Priamus is left al alone, Saue his children and his meyne Off that contre that were pryue. \u00b6 Consilium inter Regem Troianum et Filios suos. He is anoyed and al agrised, That thay of Grece him so dispised; The water brast out at his eyne, So hadde his herte mochel pyne. He saw his children that were him by, And spak to hem thus al an hy; He sais: 'lordynges, be &yogh;e ought, What schame these Grues haue vs wrought! How thei sclow &yogh;oure gode a&yogh;el! And &yogh;et ben thei of herte so fel, That thai &yogh;oure aunte foule fro &yogh;ow holde In hordam certes, as vs is tolde, In schame of &yogh;oures and gret dispite. Me thynketh ther-of, that with alle &yogh;oure my&yogh;te, Whil &yogh;e are &yogh;onge at &yogh;oure begynnyng, That &yogh;e sette ther-on alle &yogh;oure konnyng: Off hem, that were my [fader] bane And haue my suster fro me tane, To venge &yogh;ow, &yogh;if that &yogh;e mowe; For litel prise sette thai be &yogh;owe. ANd thow, Ector, myn eldest sone, On my blessyng and on my benysone, Take this charge holly on the, I praye the for the loue of me! For I am fer passed in elde, That I may not my-selff welde, And thow art hardi, strong, & bolde Be-fore alle men, and most of tolde; Thow passes alle men of strengthe & myght, Men knowen nowher so hardy a knyght, That arn vnbuxom, sterne, and stought, Thow makest hem fayn to the to lought 2303-4.

I make the ther-fore lord and sire Off alle my lond and myn Empire And also of thi brotheres alle And alle that euere vnto vs falle; Prynce, kny&yogh;t, duke, and kyng, Alle schal be at thi byddyng. And take this thyng on the be-dene, For I make me here-of alle clene And take hit the here In thyn hond; For strenger than I thow art to fond Suche lordschepe to vndirtake. Say not nay, sone, for my sake!' Ector sayde: 'be god almyght! I am most holden by skyl and right To venge the dethe of myn a&yogh;el In stoures stiffe and strong batayle, For I am eldest\u2014as &yogh;e haue told\u2014 Off alle my bretheren &yogh;ong and old; Therfore schulde I be resoun be best And al my wit ther-to kest. But on thyng, fader, I pray &yogh;ow, dere, That &yogh;e wolde now me here And haue it in gode memorie: That &yogh;e be wele a-vysed and sclye, What ende &yogh;e hope hit wol come to, For if it be bygunnen so And it come to no good ende, Then be we schent and alle oure frende, And schal haue a schame MS. aschame . ther-by With-outen ende and vilony.

Wyte &yogh;e not, that alle Aufrik And al Europe euery stik Is vndirput to hem of Grece? How riche thei ben of rentes and fece? And how the lond is ful of kny&yogh;tes That doughti ben and strong of fyghtes? Thay ben richer for-sothe then we, And mo als by thousandis thre! For Oxonye is not so good, That &yogh;e, fader, and alle oure blood For hir scholde to vile deth be brou&yogh;t; Here ramsoun were to dere bou&yogh;t. Sche may deye with-Inne a throwe, And sche is old\u2014alle men knowe;\u2014 Leue therfore that &yogh;e haue thoght, That &yogh;e ne turne &yogh;oure wil to noght!

PAris sat and held his pes; He herkenes al that Ector seys. Whan he saw Ector sitte in pes, Paris ros vp fro the des And spak on hye, herande hem alle That stode or sat In that halle; He seyth: 'my lord, er &yogh;e wende, I schal &yogh;ow telle of a good ende That we schal haue of oure batayle, If we the Grues wol assayle. How scholde we by skyl be a-ferd? Suche a toun is non [on] mydlerd, As is this toun is nowher non; Ther is no man with fleche ne bon, That in oure toun may vs confounde; It is so strong of walle and grounde.

And als god &yogh;ow mote amende, Loke that &yogh;e me with hem sende; For I wot wel: it is my chaunce To do the Gregeys gret greuaunce, And oute of Grece to &yogh;ow brynge A gentil lady fair and &yogh;ynge, That is comen of gentil blode, As fair and as gode And as gret of genterye As &yogh;oure suster Oxonye. And if &yogh;e aske how I wot this, I schal &yogh;ow telle\u2014so haue I blis:\u2014 \u00b6 The noble god Mercurius In my sclepyng he told me thus; How, and wenne, and in what wyse,\u2014 I schal &yogh;ow telle, or &yogh;e aryse. This endir day, whan I was sent At &yogh;oure biddyng and comaundement \u00b6 Hic Paris Filius Regis Troiani narrauit patri suo de sompno suo. To the lond of lytel Inde, I &yogh;ede to hunte the MS. to the . hert & hynde. Whan I was comen to the forest, Off al that day fond I no best, Til it was passed ouer the none. By him that sittes in trone! Then was I war of a gret hert, Fair, and gret, and ful smert, That &yogh;ede on land and was to leyne; Then was I glad and wondur fayne, I folwed him, til hit was nyght, And til of him I loste the syght Thorow derknesse of the leues That growed vpon the greues. I was weri of hunted & chased, So hadde I that proude hert trased; My hors forsothe was ondeles For rennyng and for werines; My felawes hadde I alle lorn, That tyme with me was no wyght born. I layd me doun vpon the playn And tyed myn hors be the rayn; Whan I was leyd, er I toke kepe For werinesse I fel on sclepe. As I lay on my sclepyng, Me thoght I saw a wondir thyng: I saw a god MS. agod . bryghter then the glemyng Come to me in my dremyng, And in his hond brou&yogh;t goddis thre, And alle were faire on to se. That on goddes of the thre was \u2014As he me sayde\u2014goddesse Pallas; The secunde was also A louely lady, dame Iuno; The thridde goddesse was dame Venus That come with god Mercurius. Mercurius sayde: \"loke vp, Paris, So haue thow Ioye In erthe or blis! By-holde Right wel these thre goddesse, For thei ben alle in gret distresse, For a stryff is be-twene hem raysed; But thorow the it schal be pesed, For \u00feei haue put hem in thi dome. Loke therfore, thow &yogh;yue gode gome, That thow &yogh;eue now rightful Iugement Afftir thi sight and thin entent. THese thre goddesse this endur day Sat at the feste of gret noblay; An Appul was to hem ybroght, A wondur fair and qweyntly wroght. That appul is with-oute doute With lettres of gold wreten aboute: That it scholde trewly &yogh;euen be To the ffairest of the thre. Iff that thow wol so moche do That thow &yogh;eue it dame Iuno, So worthi a man In al this world Is non leuyng\u2014as man has herd,\u2014 As sche treuly schal the make For that semely appul sake. And if thow &yogh;eue it goddes Pallas, Sche schal the &yogh;eue, or thow pas, Wit, and wisdam schaltow haue More than thow woldest craue. And &yogh;if thow &yogh;eue it to dame Venus, Sche bad, I scholde telle the thus: The ffairest wiff that is in Grece To thi merite therfore sche bese. Now loke wele, how thow demes, Whiche of these best besemes.\" I vysed longe these ladyes thre, Me thoghte hem alle of gret beute; But I saw hem alle In suche a poynt, That thei were naked In ilke a Ioynt; Thei seyde: thai nolde not for me spare; Thei stode be-fore me naked and bare. \u00b6 To me Venus the fairest semed, For-whi to hir the appul I demed; And sche ther-of was fayn y-now And smoterly on me sche low, And hight me, or sche fro me &yogh;ede, That I scholde haue to my mede The fairest wyff of Grece land In my bandoun MS. landoun. and In my band. And I am ther-of sekir and trayst, That &yogh;e no-thyng be ther-of a-baist To lete me pas the Greckis see; For it is certes my destanee To harme Gregeys & greue hem sore, When I am come to hem thore; For &yogh;e wot wele, and I wot als, That goddis beheste is not ffals.' When he hadde seyde, he spak no more, But sette him doun as he sat ore. BVt sir Dephebus ros vp than, And his reson thus be-gan And seide: 'lordynges, if it were so, Off eche a thyng that men schulde do, If thei caste that noght be-falle, Nis no man MS. noman . of vs nowher, bonde ne thralle, That any-thyng scholde be-gynne, fro drede That he scholde fayle or euel spede. \u00b6 Adhuc consilium inter Regem Troianum et Filios suos.

And so may we our chalange werke, For alle men schame now of vs speke.' Elenus, the brother fourthe, Ros and stood vpon the erthe And seyde: 'fader, loke &yogh;e be war, And alle that in this paleis ar! &YOGH;e wot wele alle, I haue ben ay Lered wele and can sothe say Off euery a thyng that is to come; And that wot &yogh;e bothe alle and some, That I seide neuere &yogh;it prophecie, That it ne was sothe with-oute lye. \u00b6 And I telle &yogh;ow that ben here, And namely &yogh;ow, my fader dere, That, if &yogh;e sende my brother Paris To the lond of Grece y-wis To Robbe, to reue, or harme to do, Alle we schal dye, and &yogh;e also, And my Moder, &yogh;oure wyff, the qwene, And alle &yogh;oure sones, and Pollexene; And al this toun schal turne to nau&yogh;t, If &yogh;e fulfille that &yogh;e haue thou&yogh;t: For sikurly hit schal be brent, I-throwen doun, and al to-rent.' When Elenus hadde told his tale, The kyng fro drede gan wexe pale, Off his wordes was he a-ferd sore, And so were alle that there wore. His wordes thenne alle gon a-fere, For thei wiste wele he lyed neuere; Ther was no man In that paleis Amonges hem alle ther o word seys; But sat alle stille euerychon, As who hadde schauen hem a croun MS. acroun . . TRoylus saw, thei sat al stille; That knyght thoght ther-at ille, Vpon his feet he start vp blyue And seide: 'lordynges, so mote &yogh;e thryue! What may this be that &yogh;ow now ayles?

Pauonye And broght with him gret chiualrye; Thre thousand kny&yogh;tes that were assayed Broght with him wel arayed; And alle here schippis were redy dyght And fraught with vitayles and wel pight. \u00b6 And Priamus bad Polimodas, Antenor, and Eueas, That thei with Paris to Grece schulde wende, To brynge this thyng to an ende. Thei toke leue as-tyde and &yogh;ede To here schippis with mechel spede. Thei sayled euere bothe day and nyght, Til thei hadde of Grece a syght; Thei saw an Ile of Gregeis land\u2014 Het Thitharie, I vndir-stand;\u2014 Toward that Ile drow thei faste. When thei come there, anker thei caste, And tyed here schippis in that porte And &yogh;ede to londe to take disporte. IN that Ile of Thitharie Was a temple of Auncetrie Set In honoure of Veneris, Ther sche hadde mochel worschepe ywis; For alle the men of that land Make to here gret offerand Off siluer, gold, and tresour; Ther was richesse with-oute mesour. For thei truste alle and vndirstode, That no man myght do but gode, The whil thei hadde help of here Many a lond and many a schire. For then held thei an hye feste-day Off that goddesse with gret noblay: On here manere and there a-vise Thei made to here gret sacrifice Off Bolles, Bores, and other bestes. When Paris herde of these festes, \u00b6 He wente to that solennite, The temple and that Ioye to se; And his ffelawys with [him] &yogh;ede, Semely dyght in golden wede, And offered there, as other dede, And his felawes forth myde. \u00b6 He was apparayled as a kyng; Alle men seide, bothe old and &yogh;yng: \"So fair a man saw thei neuere non, Made in erthe of blod ne bon.\" Men askede alle: \"what he myght be, And when he was, and of what contre, And what he did in that lond thore?\" Men spak of him bothe lasse & more, Off his beute spak &yogh;onge and olde. At the laste the word was tolde \u00b6 To qwene Eleyne, that was fair and milde, That dwellid a litel with-oute the Ilde In a castel gret & strong. The los of Paris so wide sprong Off his noblay and beute, That Elene saide: \"sche wolde him se.\" Sche did hir dight an hors of pris, And toke with hir other ladies, And &yogh;ede thedir with hir comperes, And in the temple made hir preyeres To the goddesse that ther sat, And made hir offryng afftir that. Whan Paris herde of hir telle, To the temple &yogh;ede he snelle, Gloriously and richely dight, And stode euene In hir syght; For he hadde many a long day Be-fore herd telle of hir & say, \"That sche was the fairest wiff Off alle wymmen that euere bar lyff.\" PAris thenne with meke mode A&yogh;eyn the qwene he &yogh;ode and stode, And loked on hir euere in on; A bryghter brid of blod ne bon Thoght him neuere that he hadde sen, Sithe in this world he hadde ben. Alle his hert was on hir set, For that thei were to-gedir met; And when sche hadde of him a syght, Hir thoght him the fayrest knyght That sche hadde sene In al hir lyue; Sche wolde wel fayn haue ben his wyue. \u00b6 Sche loked on him, and he on hir; Eyther other now desir, How thei myght theire loue fulfille, Ne how to schewe here herte wille. But atte laste thei drowe hem nere And spak to-gedir so In-fere, That, er that thei thennes wente, Thei were bothe at on assente. He toke then leue at qwene Eleyne, Off here spekyng he was fayne; To his schippis he him hied, Ther thei stode faste tied. He did a-non to him calle His felawes and his meyne alle; When thei were comen to him thore, He seide: 'lordynges, lesse and more! &YOGH;e wote wel whi we come hidur, And what &yogh;e wolde, and also whedur. \u00b6 The principal cause of oure comyng Is to aryue on Thelamon, the kyng, Our kynges suster for to wynne With fight of sword or other gynne. But sekirly that may we not! We may not do that we haue thoght, For he is strong and hath gode frende; We gete hir not out of his bende, Ne we ben not of pouste Vnto hadde ne to take the Cite. Wherfore, my dere lordynges, That I telle &yogh;ow now this tythynges: IN this Ile is now a qwene, The fairest lady that man may sene, That comen is of gret kynrede, That Menelaus kynge has wede.

Er nyght be gon and comen day, I rede that we now take oure grace, That god sende vs, whil we haue space.' Some assented wel ther-to, And some seyn \"it is noght to do;\" But thei acorded atte laste, When the day was gon and paste, And the sonne was went adoun, And alle men on slepe In the toun, To harme hem, whan it was late, And to the temple toke here gate, And robbed & reued alle that thei fond, And ledde with hem In-to the lond: NIght is comen, and day is went, The Troyens haue here armour hent, To the temple ben thei gon, Paris and his men echon.

Alle that in the temple was founden, Was to-geder lapped and wounden And born in coffres to the see And herbard ther-Inne in here naue. And Paris toke that lady swete And led hir to his schippis schete, And lefft hir there In the same kepyng And other fele with hir wepyng. \u00b6 When Paris hadde on this wise done, He &yogh;ede a&yogh;eyn thedur sone And toke echon to his seruage, Man and womman, wiff and Page, Ther was of this a wondir cry. Ther stode a Castel a litel ther-by, Gret, and stiff, and ful strong, With dyche and walles wide and long; Men of armes that Castel &yogh;emed. Whan that thei herd wymmen so remed, Thei hadde meruayle what it myght be; Thei resen vp, the sothe to se. But of tythandes when thei herde, How thei of Troie with hem ferde, Thei armed hem with mochel haste; But sekirly it was but waste, \u00b6 For thei of Troye were mo than thai,\u2014 The furthe dowble, I dar wel say\u2014 And sclow hem foule, when thei were met; Thei were with hem so ouer-set, That thei my&yogh;th not fro hem fle Ne at here &yogh;ates take entre; Thei folwed hem s\u00f3, that thei myght not pas. And al the riches that ther was, That thei myght fynde, that ought was worth, Thei of Troye bar with hem forth. \u00b6 Hic Paris rapuit Elenam vxorem Menelan. [ sic ] Regis. And eche man than with his god schippes And alle here good thedur skippes, And drow vp sayl and hyed hem ffaste In-to the see, that thei were paste. PAris hath now Eleyne wonne; To take the see thei haue by-gonne, Thei sayled alle on a rawe, Til thei were come ther thei were knawe, The lond of Troye, Then were thei glad. When thei were comen & the lond had, Thei were glad ther-of echone; Saue Eleyne thenne made moche mone, Fro hir lond that sche hath lorn, And hir doughter that sche hadde born, And fro the kynges hir bretheren bothe. But Paris therfore was ful wrothe, He comforted hir and. bad hir ses, Leue hir sorwe and be In pes. He called to him his Messanger And bad him take a good Courser And [ride] to Priamus, the kyng, And telle him this tydyng: \"That he was comen to Thenedoun Saue and sound, with many a moun That MS. And that . he hath wonnen with his hond To be In seruage In his lond, And that he hath broght so fair a lady, To be In stede of Oxonye, Off the gentillest kyn and blode, That was be-&yogh;onde the Grekis flode.\" The Messager as-tyde forth rode To Priamus with-outen abode, He tolde him tydynges of Paris: \"How he was comen home y-wys, And how he hadde by-&yogh;onde ywroght, And of the qwene that he hom broght.\" WHen Priamus herde these tythand, He myght vnnethe for Ioye stand Opon his fete, so was he glad; Alle the grete of Troye he bad Come to him, tythandes to here. And when his court was al plenere, He bad him do his message To alle the lordes that there were Perhaps we ought to alter the last three words to: & baronage . . And he tolde hit al an hye, That alle myght here that stood nye; \u00b6 Then were Ioyful the Troyens, And gret Ioye made the citeseyns. The morwe folwyng, whan it was lyght, Paris dede Eleyne wel dyght Richely In gay wede, And broght to hir a noble stede, And he sette hir ther-on And rode thenne fro Thenedon Toward Troye a wel soffte pas. And his prisoneres he has Sent by-fore vpon a route With men and kny&yogh;tes alle aboute; He made hem wende a litel before, And he him-self and Antenore, Dephebus and Eueas, And also Polidonias, Come afftirward with qwene Eleyne, Rydyng soffte vpon the pleyne, Til thei come at Troye ney-hande.

And afftirward &yogh;ede to the qwene And profered hir his owne to bene. And so rode thay alle to Troye; The folk ther-Inne made mochel Ioye, Ther was gadered alle the toun With mochel Ioye and processioun, With alle Musik and menstrasye, To kepe the qwene of genterye. \u00b6 Priamus lyght of his palfray At the &yogh;ates In-myddes the way, And toke him-self qwene Eleyne Amongis hem alle by the rayne, And lad hir him-self alweys Thorow the toun to his paleys. \u00b6 Then on the morwe, when thei saw tyme, A litel while be-fore the prime, &YOGH;ede lady Eleyne and sir Paris Vnto the temple Palladis And weddid hem to-gedir thore. For afftirward it rewed hem ful sore, And alle the gladnesse that thei hadde tho, Turned hem to sorwe and to wo.

This riche feste lastis al-wayes Til hit were xviij dayes, And alle the men of the Cite Tentid to noght but to gamen and to gle. But when Cassandre herde that tale, That thei hadde mad a newe bridale Off qwene Eleyne and Alisaundre, Mechel dole made thenne Cassaundre. Sche cried, sche wepid, and so ferde, That alle the Paleis here noyse herde. To the temple sche hir hyed, And on the Troyens loude sche cried; Sche seide: 'alas, vnwitti men, Caytiff Troyens, and wymmen! Whi make &yogh;e alle this Ioye and song? Sicurly &yogh;e haue gret wrong To make suche Ioye of here wedlak, For it schal greue &yogh;ow alle the pak, For &yogh;e schul se &yogh;oure children sclayn For weddynge of dame Eleyn, And &yogh;e &yogh;oure-self Caytyves schal dye For mochel wo and turmentrye. \u00b6 A noble Troye! that art so hye, This weddyng schaltow dere abye!

But Priamus bad hir sitte stille, For alle the toun thoght ther-of ille. For sche nolde do his byddyng For wele ne wo ne other thyng, Then putte thei here in distresse For here crying and hir wodnesse. ELeyne is weddid to Paris With mochel murthe and Ioye y-wys; Eche man ther-of Ioye has, Thei ledyn here lyff In gret solas. But when the kyng Menelans Herde telle of this chauns, That thei of Troye hadde lad away Quene Eleyne vnto here pray,\u2014 That was his owne gentil wiff, That he loued as his lyff,\u2014 Suche a sorwe to him he cau&yogh;te, That his deth almost he lau&yogh;te: He lay in swone longe, or he spak ought, So was he so ney the dethe broght; But whan he reuerted and ros a&yogh;eyn, 'Alas,' he seyde, 'thow faire Eleyn!'

But he no-wise myght comfort haue, For he ferde as he scholde raue; He toke his hors with-oute abode And to his lond wel faste he rode; And duke Nestor with him &yogh;ede,\u2014 He wolde not leue him In that nede;\u2014 For whan Troyens dede this trespas, Menelaus at home not was, He was with duke Nestor, that sire, At his Cite that men called Pire. Whan he was to his lond y-come, His men were glad alle and some; Vn-to his brother a lettre MS. alr\u00afe\u00af . he lete dyght, That Agamenon that tyme hyght, And to Pollus, and to kyng Castor,\u2014 That I haue spoken of be-fore,\u2014 That were his wyues bretheren bothe: He prayed hem for leue or for lothe, That thei scholde come with-outen dwellyng And speke with him for any-thyng.

And when thei heere of this tythandes, Ther is no kyng of Grece landes, That thei wol come with grete meyne And wende with vs ouer the see, And venge vs of the vylony That we haue for dame Oxony, And wynne a&yogh;eyn thi wiff Eleyne, Maugre ther tethe, be thow certeyne!'

But sykurly to seye the sothe: Bothe here bretheren were so wrothe, \u00b6 Whan thei herde telle of this That here suster ferd amys,\u2014 Thei nolde a-byde for no flot, But toke ther men and schippus ful hot And &yogh;ede als faste In-to the see With thaire men and here naue; For thei wende wele hem ouer-tane Paris sone, and bene his bane. But sykurly thei sayled not longe, On In the see the wedur spronge, That thei were drowned bothe two And alle here men with hem also. Hit was not fully two dayes past, That thei were drowned bothe schip and mast, And leffte here lyues ther to-gedur In that tempest and that wedur. AGamenon and his brother To Thelaman and many other Kyng and duke ther lettres sente, To alle that dwelled fer or hente, To the lond of Grece that langed; And thei here lettres gladly fanged, And whan thei hadde here lettres red, Eueryche a kyng to hem thanne sped \u00b6 Hic Reges Grecorum elegerunt Agamenon Imperatorem.

THei &yogh;ede thanne to her parlement And seide be dome and right Iugement, That Agemenon was worthi By-fore alle other sikurly To bere the state and to be Emperour, For he was wise and good gyour. Thei sayden alle with-outen les, That to the hauen of Athenes Was good to do her naue come, For ther myght thei alle stonde In romme, To alle the lordes that there were Were redy dyght and samed there With ther meyne, to passe the flood Toward Troye, when thei seyen good.\u2014 And whan thei hadde ordeyned this, Thei toke ther leue In Ioye and blis; And Agamenon and his brother And echon partyd tho fro other; And &yogh;ede eche a man to his contre, And gadered men and his naue, And spede hem faste to Athenes With gret naue and moche pres.

Was non so proud proued his pere, The whiles he was on lyue here; For I ffynde In prose and ryme, Was non so strong In that tyme.

GRet consail and parlementes Thei made offte In her tentes: How thei scholde do, and how to fete, For Troye to wynne for that grete hete; And how thei scholde lyue, whil thei were thore, And w[h]ere thei scholde haue her store.\u2014 Vpon a day that emperour Alle MS. And alle . the lordes of that honour In-to a playn dede clepe and calle; When thei were comen to him alle, \u00b6 He seide: 'lordynges, se &yogh;e alle wele: The Troyens &yogh;eue of vs no dele; With fairnes wil thei not loute, Thei ben of herte so stoute. With myght and strengthe we mot conquere Alle that in the toun are there,\u2014 And long also ben &yogh;eres ten,\u2014 For thei ben alle doughti men; And we may hem not assaile, But if vs come offte vitayle. \u00b6 Hic incipit bellum per Grecos contra Regem Cesile. Here is a lond with-Inne the see, Off alle manere of good that is plente; I wene, men calle hit Cecyle. If that it be &yogh;oure alleres wille, I rede: sende thedur oure sonde To the kyng of that londe, And bidde him, that he wol puruay Mete and drynke by nyght and day And sende vs ouer with pees & reste; And thus me thinket, it were beste.' When Agamenon hadde sayde thus, Achilles and sir Thelaphus\u2014 That was Ercules owen sone\u2014 Were chosen be eleccione, To do this erande and wende ther way; And nother of hem seide 'nay.' Thei toke with hem, to passe the see, Off doughti knyghtes thousandes thre, And sayled faste vnto that land And lete here schippus In hauen stand, And drow out horses and stedes And here strong Iren wedes. WHen Theman kyng herd say, That thei of Grece In suche aray Were opon his lond alyght, He made him redi with hem to fyght; He broght with him to that batayle Off men of Armes and other pedayle Thousandes fele and hundres als, With swerdes and scheldes aboute here hals. And whan Gregeis saw hem comande, To putte hem thus out of that lande, Opon a res thei to him rode, And thei to him with-outen abode. A gret batayle was be-twene hem tho, For her enemys were wel the mo, For sicur thei were suche thre Then Achilles & his meyne. On euery side thei fel thikke doun, Some alle dede, and som in swoun. Off hem of Grece ther died gret won, And of that other many on. The Gregeis were of gret power, Thei ne hadde endured in no maner, Ne hadde Achilles I-bene Agayn her foos\u2014and that was sene.\u2014 He saw many that him assayled And his men wel thikke fayled; He loked wel faste In here fyghtyng, Where he myght se her kyng; Where he faught, he was wel war, And Gregeis faste to erthe he bar. AChilles then vnto him prykes, And many a strok to him he strikes, And threwe him doun to the grounde With many delful hidous wounde; He thoght the kyng right ther sclo, Or he wolde fro him go. \u00b6 But Thelaphus that be-held And kept that strok vpon his scheld, He seide: 'Achilles, leue sire, For goddis loue, leue thin Ire! I pray &yogh;ow for goddis ore, That &yogh;e to him do harme no more; But &yogh;eues me this curtais knyght, That &yogh;e haue ouercome in fyght.' \u00b6 Achilles sayde: 'what may this be? Thelaphus, what eyles the, Off me to craue and aske mercy Off him that is thin enemy?' Thelaphus seide: 'sire, be my fay! Al the sothe I schal &yogh;ow say, Now ar &yogh;e hennes wende: This man was my fadir frende, And gret worschepe to me hath done; By him, that made sonne & mone, For him therfore mercy I craue, The kny&yogh;tes body of the to haue.' \u00b6 'Thelaphus,' he seyde, 'take him the, I &yogh;eue him the al clene fro me; Do with him al thi wille, Whether thow wil saue him or spille.' Thelaphus toke vp thenne Theman,\u2014 For bledynge he was blo and wan,\u2014 And sente him home to his dwellyng; Off here fyght made thei endyng. But Theman prayed sir Achilles And Thelaphus with-outen les: \"That thei wolde home with him wende, For he was ney at his ende; And Thelaphus wolde he kyng make And his reme to him take, For of his body hadde he non air, To kepe that lond that was so fair.\" \u00b6 To-geder bothe with him thei wente, Whan the batayle was thus ente. Whan thei come to his forselet, And he was layde, and thay doun set, He sente affter his baronage, And dede hem MS. hem , altered from him . make to him omage And corouned him by-forn hem alle, To be here kyng, right In that halle. And thus Thelaphus is mad her kyng And has that lond in gouernyng, For Theman dyed in that stede And beryed he was with mochel pride. THelaphus is now lord and sire Off al that lond and that empire And alle the goodes that Theman hadde, And alle ben hise, for so he badde; For he is ded and richely graven. And Achilles is In the haven, And his schippus are richely fraught With flesshe and fysche and other aught, With corne and mele and tonnes of flour And gentil wynes of good odour; And maketh him redi forward to fare, And Thelaphus makes him al &yogh;are With him a-&yogh;eyn to the Gregeis go, To Thenedoun that he come fro. \u00b6 But Achilles to him says, \"That he scholde dwelle ther In pais And puruay vitayles and store, That thei may lyue, whil that thei ben thore.\" And Thelaphus dwellid stille At his byddyng a&yogh;eyns his wille, And Achilles toke the see With his vitayles and his naue; And sayled forth to Thenedoun, Ther he fond Agamenoun And alle the lordis of that ost Dwellynge stille in that cost. \u00b6 And when thei herde of his comyng, To him thei ran bothe lord and kyng And welcomed him deuotly, Of his comyng glad were thei. \"How he hadde sped,\" he tolde hem alle, \"And of Thelaphus how it was falle, And dwelled ther stille and be lord and kyng And puruay hem vitayles of alle thyng;\" He schewed the vitayles that thei hadde brought With him to londe, he heled it noght. Then were the Gregeis Proude and fayn, That thei herde the certayn, That he was lord of that kyndome Fro whethen alle that riches is come. Thei bad god &yogh;eue him blis, That so wisly him dud I-wys; For now drede thei no-thyng, Nother of mete ne of drynk, \u00b6 Now hath Achilles hem vitayles brought. Agamenon is In moche thoght, How thei schul Troye be-sege best; Many a wyle and wit the[i] kest, Whether thei wente by day or by nyght And take the land with-oute syght, Whil thei of Troye were alle on sclepe And to hem wolde take no kepe; But thei were ferd, if that thei went By nyghtes tyme, lest thei were yschent And breke her schippus on cragges and stones, And lost hem selff al at ones. And so dwelled the Gregeys thore A ful twelue monthe and more, That thei to Troye toke non hede; So hadde thei alle of hem suche drede. But Stace telles vs and says, That thei lye so long in pays For drede thei hadde of Ector knyght, So mochel thei dredde of his myght. Then seyde Diomedes: 'How longe schal we lye her In pes, Gode men, kynges and dukes? Drede of herte vs alle rebukes! We ben so ferd of oure enemys, That thei bere vs to no prys; We haue now leyne and rest vs here\u2014 &YOGH;e wot alle wel\u2014more than a &yogh;ere, That we durst neuere be water ne londe Se ones Troye right at honde. What may they wene but cowardise Off vs for-sothe and gret ffayntise, That we ben so of hem a-dred, That we for drede ben al mad? \u00b6 Alas that we so longe a-byden, That we ne hadde rather to hem reden And the toun myghtily assayled, Sicurly it hadde vs a-vayled! For now drede thei vs right noght, For we haue noght to hem wroght, But spend oure good and oure vitayle; And that doth vs noght a-vayle. And thei hem gete lordes kene, A-&yogh;eyns vs hem to mayntene; For we haue sene, sethen we come hidur, Many kynges comen thedur With gret meyne and chiualrie, To helpe wel her partie. \u00b6 Gret schame it is\u2014as hit is sene\u2014 That we durst neuere Troye mene, Ne neuere durst we hit ones se, Kyng Priamus and his Cite! Whi dwelle we thus In suche manere? I rede, dwelle we no lenger here, Hic Imperator et omnes Reges Grecorum nauigant versus Troianum. Be it to wele or to wo\u2014 I rede, that we hennes go, \u00b6 Ryse erly, when the day dawes, Put vs forth among the wawes, With alle oure schippus with mochel Ioye Wende we to the Cite of Troye; For we schal neuere other-wyse Opon the Troyens lond arise.' The kynges assented wel ther-to, Thei sayde thei myght no betre do; Thei let crie al on hye, That euery knyght were thenne redy, That thei were redy In the dawenyng To wende forth with-oute dwellyng. NIght is went and gon a-way, Day is dawed and is day, It was a louely morn, And Agamenon blew his horn. Anon the lordes of the flete Out with here schippis thei dede schete Out of the hauenes in-to the see, With al here men and ther naue. And ther ordeyned that Emperour And MS. That . alle the lordes of gret honour, Whiche of the schippis schal go by-fore, And how fele hundres and score, And whiche schal wende afftirward, And whiche in the mydward. So that he ordeyned thus, That the kyng Protheselus, That was a kyng of gret noblay, The hauen schulde furst asay With an hundred schippis grete; And he ther byddyng wold not lete. \u00b6 He gadered his schippus on a route, And bad hem gadere him a-boute And sayle besyde him euer nye, And drawe her sayl wel on hye, And sette here baneres on the mast; And sayle forth were thei not agast Toward Troye a wel gode pas. And alle these other vpon a ras, Euery lord\u2014as he was boden,\u2014 Now are thei toward Troye reden With gret thretyng and manas hard. Prothesely hath the vanward, The lond of Troye for to take; But furst schal he and alle hese qwake For drede of deth, or thei take reste; Er schal thei suffre mochel breste, Or thei take bank or brynke; Thei tolde it not as thei thynke. GRegeis ben alle graythed &yogh;are To the toun of Troye to fare; Thei ar comen so ney her wones, That thei se bothe toures and stones And the subbarbes al aboute; But thei hadde so moche doute, How thei scholde on londe lyght For hem of Troye whan thei hadde a syght; For many a Troyen sen thei stonde Armed wel opon the londe, To put hem fro the water bankes, That thei ne tok lond but ther vnthankes. \u00b6 But sicurly when thei of Troye, Kyng and quene, knyght and boye, Say the Gregeys sayles long and large, Eche man hente bothe sword and targe And drow forth hors and gret cou[r]ser, And rode and ran to the ryuer With-oute heste of here kyng Or with-outen Ectoris wetyng; That Gregeys scholde no lond take With-oute bale and mochel wrake. \u00b6 But Prothesaly the formast was Off alle the schippis In that ras, Saw he not no better to do Ne on no wise to come to, But thorow strokes and fyght. He sayled forthe to hem streyght With alle the schippis In his ledyng; But gret foly dede ther that kyng, For he sayled In with a feble sayl And \u00feat was him to wrotherhayl: For the wynd was hard and store And so faste him to the lond bore, \u00b6 A&yogh;eyns the bank hem so droff, That many a chippe MS. chipp . ther al to-roff, And the men fel out and sank Dede and drowned by the bank. And tho that on the lond dede lepe The Troyens leyde vpon an hepe, Thei bare hem doun and sclow al-weyes Doun to grounde the Gregeis; To scle hem the Troyens not belened, In-to the sky the strokes dened. \u00b6 The Gregeys &yogh;olled and cried loude, It was a-bouen hem lyke a cloude, So fley the arwes to and fro That the Gregeis dyed with mechel wo. Lond and water was al rede Off hem that were sclayn and dede. Sithen schippis &yogh;ode MS. &yogh;owe . furst with sayl and wynd, Might neuere man In book fynd, With so gret wo to gete land, As the Gregeys dede, I vndirstand. PRothesaly hath his naue Neyhondes lorn and his meyne Thorow his outrage and his vn-wit, Opon the lond so harde he hit. But than come sayland opon a rowe Afftirward with sayles lowe An hundrid schippis gret and stronge With semely mastes fair and longe In-to that hauen war and wisly,\u2014 Ther other men were wel grisly, In the water swam and flotered, And there schippis a-boute totered; And to the lond so sofft thei sette, That thei were nothyng lette With bank ne cragge ne with ston. But thenne come Troiens many on To the bank to hem ful blyue, Fro the lond hem to dryue. But in the schippis were goode archeres With dartes and gonnes & Arb[l]asteres; The Gregeis thenne her bowes bent And many an arwe thei hem sent, Many a darte was ther cast and schotyn, And many a bodi ouer-floten. The Gregeis were apert and quyk, That arwes on londe thei dede styk, That many of Troye to dethe fell With dynt of Arwe and of qwarell; Thei drow a-bak\u2014so were thei hurt.\u2014 The Gregeis on the lond sturt And faught boldely and at devis Opon the lond with here enemys; Thei helden Troyens hard and stale, But scholde thei neuere of bote herd bale, Ne hadde ben Prothesaly, T[h]e noble kyng of Filaundry. HE sclow that tyme with-outen vmbre Mo Troyens than I can numbre MS. humbre . ; Nadde he ben and his noblay, Hadde neuere Gregeys passed a-way; For sicurly his doughtynes, Alone his my&yogh;th and his prowes, Saued alle the Grwes that ther were Fyghtyng in feld tho there. But for alle his myth MS. myth . that he hadde The last four words by another hand, myth on erasure. The Gregeis were so harde be-stadde, That many on MS. manyon . on grounde lay, For tho of Troye were mo than thay. Hem were leuere dye than fflee, And to be drowned in the see; To theire schippis hadde thei no teynt, Thei were so for-foghten and almost faynt. The Troyens droff hem bak-ward With harde strokes the see toward, Than were thei dreven to the bank, That many fel In the see and sank. \u00b6 But thenne come many a gret karik, Ful of knyghtes wel ydyght; Kyng Procenor and Archelaus Come then to helpe Prothesalaus; With alle ther men on londe thei wente, With hardi herte and good entente To socour her frendes: that was hem leff, In dout of dethe that was In myscheff. \u00b6 But alle thei were In drede of dede MS. The last two\u00b7 letters of dede by a later hand on erasure. ; Schuld thei neuere haue eten brede, Not for hem alle ne Procenor, Ne hadde not come the duke Nestor: But he come then to the batayle, As faste as he myght sayle, With many a schip and many a floyne; For him and his schippis fil fair fortune, And louely grace god to him sende, That he and hise sauely des[c]ende MS. defende . Opon that lond with-oute hurtyng, With-oute harme or schipe MS. schip . brekyng. \u00b6 Then myght men se speres schake, And many a man for drede qwake; Here swordes o corrected from e . thriffly to-gedur rang, Eche a man on other dang; The arwes &yogh;ede so thikke on hye, That no man myght for hem se the skye; Arwes and quareles thikke flewe, Euery man on other hewe; Thei fel doun ded on euery halue, That neuere myght be heled with oyment ne salue. THen come a-londe kyng Alacris, And Askalus with alle his, With doughti knyghtes gode and fresche, With grete speres of Oke and asche. Thei wounden the Troyens thikke, And faught with hem wel quykke, And thei of Troye bakward drowe; And many fel ded In sowe. \u00b6 But fele Troyens stode be-syde, That hadde not meved of alle that tyde, Ne neuere &yogh;aff stroke of al that day, But by-held the batayle ay. \u00b6 Hic venit ad bellum cum magno suo vlixes. But whan thei sey her men hadde nede, Thei come doun wel good spede; Thei socoured here felawes egrely And sclow the Gregeys bitterly; Thei wounded many in that poynt, Ther was lorn many a Ioynt, Many a leg and many a thye, Many an hond and many a kne; Some loste his nase and his lyppis. Thei droff hem bacward to here schippis, For drede of dethe and myghtles Thei were brou&yogh;t al in distres, That thei hadde dyed with swerdes orde Or drouned vndir schippis borde, Ne hadde Vlixes comen then With many a knyght and doughti men. THe Gregeis myght hem not defende, But Vlixes was then ner-hende And toke the londe, and &yogh;ede forth streyght With alle his men to the fyght. The Grues toke herte In his comyng, That thei that were be-fore fleyng, Turned a-&yogh;eyn, and hertely ran On her fomen, and offte hem wan Off hem of Troye, be his helpyng. Vlixes then began to spryng \u00b6 A-mong Troyens anon, In many stedis bare he hem don, And hurt hem sore and lefft hem bledande With a spere he bar In hande, And wounded many gode Troyene. And that beheld kyng Phylomene, How he bare Troyens to the grounde, Wondir many In a stounde; Him thoght In-sonder his hert gnowe, That he dede Troyens so doun drowe; He thoght to him for to ride, To se if he him wolde abyde And made him of his dedis sese. Philomene rode to Vlixes And &yogh;aff him certes suche a poppe, That he fel ouer his hors croppe. \u00b6 But Vlixes anon vp ros, And to the kyng a-&yogh;eyn he gos Off that strok to take vengaunce; He smot Philomene with his launce Ryght euen In-myddis his scheld, That it flow out In the feld; He brast his Pisan and his coloret And claff his vayn In his goriet: Vlixes &yogh;aff him suche a wounde, That he fel dede almost to grounde; Alle the Troyens that ther wore Wende, he scholde haue dyed thore. \u00b6 A gret wayment and hidous cry Might men here then witterly, That the Troyens made y-wys For the wounde of Philomenys. Thei drow him fro his hors fete And leyde him sofftly and swete Opon his scheld with gret wepyng, As he hadde ben sclepyng, And bare him faire of that stede, That men ne hors scholde on him trede. \u00b6 That fel faire for men of Grece, Thei hadde elles dyed euery pece; For certes ne hadde ben that combraunce, That ne hadde fallen that myschaunce, \u00b6 Hic venit Imperator & omnes alij Reges Grecorum ad prelium. The Gregeis hadde neuere passed that place, But thei had dyed,\u2014suche was here grace. PHilomene was wounded ille. The MS. That . Gregeis were In poynt to spille; Thei nyste what thei schulde haue don, Ne hadde ben the kyng hurt so sone; Thei hadde ben hewen euery a schrede, But hem come help In that nede: \u00b6 For then come the kyng Thoas With alle the naue that his was, And the doughti Thelamanyous, And with his schippis Menelaus, \u00b6 And the Emperour Agamenon; Euery man the lond lepe on And toke her hors and theder rode With baneres blauwande bright and brode, And the Gregeis were rescued, And many a Troyen ther thei bowed, And bare hem doun opon the grounde, With speres scharpe and with hidous wounde. \u00b6 The noble kyng Prothesaly, That alle that day so nobly Hadde foughten ther In armes prest, Sete be-syde to take his rest, Ther the batayle was ffurst by-gunne; He saw the place was al by-ronne, Spred with blod and dede bodyes, That ther lay sclayn that hadde ben hes; He saw hem sclayn and ligge ther, He wepit for hem many a ter. \u00b6 He toke his stede by the rayne, To the fight he &yogh;ede a-&yogh;ayne, Ful of woundes and of Ire; He brende for wo as any fire For his gode men that were sclayn And al to-hewen MS. alto hewen . body and brayn. He thoght, her dethe wolde he venge, He sought the batayle euery renge; Off strong ne feble toke he no kepe, He sclow hem doun, as it were schepe, Many gode Troyen that tyde Sclow that kyng with woundes wyde In his outrage and his wodnes; The Troyens were then myghtles. \u00b6 Vnto her help and here refute A worthi kyng and ful deuoute, The noble kyng of Ethiope; Then was ther many a blodes drope. When comen Ethiopenes, Gret hardines toke the Troyens, Thei Turned a&yogh;eyn on ther fomen And sclow hem doun by nyne and ten, And droff hem to the water efft. Ther schulde no Gregeis on lyue haue lefft, Ne hadde comen Palamydes With many a scheld, with bond and fes; With hors and man was he thanne boun, To that batayle he come soun And bar doun men as he were wode, And spilled faste the Troyens blode. \u00b6 A doughti Troyen he by-helde, That many a Gregeis In that felde Hadde sclayn that day, sir Sygamon, The kynges brother gode Mennon. With a spere\u2014was scharp y-grounde, Better was non amonges hem all yfounde,\u2014 Palamydes to him rode, That thorow his sydes bothe it glode, \u00b6 Hic venit Ector cum populo suo ad prelium. That Segamon his liff for-&yogh;ede And fel doun ded by his stede. He rod forth & lefft him lygand, To the batayle faste smytand; \u00b6 He sclow the Troyens\u2014as he were wod\u2014 And schedde wel mochel of here blod, That thei myght suffre no lenger; Tho were the Grues wel the strenger, On euery a syde the Troiens flede; Then thei were hard be-stede, With mochel noye and wo thei fau&yogh;t. The Gregeis then toke a drau&yogh;t Toward the toun ney halff a myle, Many a Troyen died that while. \u00b6 The noyse was moche & gret clamour; Ector herde hem make sorow, For tene his herte began to bollen, And bothe his chekes gret swollen; He toke his armes and his atyre, That were as bryght as siluer wyre; A better man was neuere on molde, He bar a scheld of rede golde, With thre lyons paynted ther-In; A delful note he thoght be-gyn. ECtor MS. EEtor . is armed, his stede be-strode, He rod forth with-oute a-bode, Toward his men gan he gange, Him thoght he dwelled ther to longe. He saw the Troyens faste fleand, He rod to hem faste criand And bad: \"thei scholde a-&yogh;eyn turne,\"\u2014 'Drede &yogh;ow not &yogh;oure enemys sturne!' Ihesu lord! what thei were glad, When thei here noble leder had! \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit Prothesalium Regem. Was non so feble his voyce here, But it amendid herte and chere, And turned a-&yogh;eyn with hardi herte A-&yogh;eyn here enemys wonder smerte. \u00b6 Ector rode In that batayle, Armes myght him non a-vayle; Wo was him that he ful hit, For of his lyff was he quyt. He partid the Gregeis host in-sundir, Eche man of him hadde wondir; Off suche a man haue &yogh;e non herd! Alle that he hitte, to dethe thei ferd. \u00b6 As he rode to inserted over line between rode and Gregeis . Gregeis thus sleande, A&yogh;eyns him mette he comande A doughti kyng, Prothesalye, That many of Troye that day dede dye; He smot him offte with his swerd naked, That many Gregeis afftir qwaked; With his swerd Ector him smot, That he fel doun anon fot hot; He cleff the body euen In halff, As it hadde ben a clouen calff. WAs non so bold, durst by him pas; Eche man asked, \"what he was?\" Thei fled fro him as fro the ded; Whom that he hitte, ete neuere bred. The Gregeis pride Ector abasched, He sclow so fele, er he sesed, That alle were ferd that on him loked; He maymed many, and made hem croked Off legge, of arme, of fote, or too; But &yogh;it sclow he of hem wel moo. Alle made him way and lete him ride, Was non so bold durst him a-byde. The sonne goth doun, it is ney euen, Many a stroke hath Ector &yogh;euen, He was weri of men scleyng, Off ffyghtyng, and of strokes &yogh;euyng, For he sesid neuere with-oute fayle,\u2014 And that was certes moche meruayle!\u2014 Fro the tyme that he by-gan, Off al that day he neuere belan. \u00b6 Gregeis be-gan for to fle, And Ector rod to his Cite And leffte that other ther ffyghtande. Achilles cam thenne faste saylande With alle his gode Mirmydanes; With sword and spere and gret burdones Vnto that batayle he him hyed, The Gregeis thenne a-&yogh;eyn relyed; Thei hadde comfort of his comyng, On hem of Troye thei MS. i inserted by a later hand. gonne thryng. AChilles be-gan Troyens to felle, Some to wounde, and some to quelle; Thei died faste on bothe parties, He made aboutes him wayes and sties. Achilles brou&yogh;t with him ridand Off men of Armes thre thousand; Then hadde the Troyens ful gret doute Thei fel doun dede ouer-al a-boute; For then were Gregeis alle on londe, With swordes and speres & staff in honde, Fyghtand faste In that assaut; The Troyens faste ther dethe laut, For Achilles wodely Sclow hem doun ful delfoly; Thei myght no lenger him with-stande, Thei turned the bak faste fleande, Toward Troye to saue here lyues. But Achilles afftir dryues, He felde hem doun on euery side The last two words of this line, and the last three of the next, by a later hand, partially on erasure. And lefft hem liyng with woundes wide. \u00b6 Thei ffolwede hem to Troyes &yogh;ate; Wo was hem that come to late, For he was sclayn with-oute pite, That ther by tyme hadde non entre. It was hidous and right grisly Off Troiens thenne to heere her cry, The fadres saw here children bold Lye ded In the strete Cold MS. wol Cold , a letter (probably d ) being erased behind wol , and Cold added by a later hand. , Then was ther dele with-oute lau&yogh;ter; The Gregeis made of hem gret slau&yogh;ter, And wounded hem in here fleyng. But thei were lettid of her entryng: \u00b6 For then come ride the gode Troylus, And his brother Dephebus, And droff a-&yogh;eyn the ffel Gregis With strokes sadde and mechel vnpes; Hit was derk nyght by thenne y-wys, Achilles &yogh;ede with mochel blys, With mochel Ioye and gret preysyng, With his Gregeis to here restyng; And thei of Troye with barre & haspe Spered the &yogh;ates with many a claspe, That thei with-oute come not In With-Inne the nyght with scleyght ne with gyn. AGamenon lokes on euery syde A place couenable on to MS. onto . abyde; He bad hem alle, her tentis sette; Thei swore alle, \"thei wold not lette MS.

HIt is day, the Cok hath crowen, Many an horn thanne was blowen, Many an horn and many a pipe; Thei be-gan her Armure gripe Bothe In feld and In toun; Thei rered many a gomfanoun, Baneres brode of fyne asure, Grene, and white, of purpur pure, Some were rede as vermyloun, With pelotes, daunse, and Cheueroun, Some with sauters engrele, And some with bastoun wouerle, Off sable some, of siluer fyn, And some of hem be-gan to schyn. \u00b6 Hic Ector ordinat prelium suum. \u00b6 Ector bad his men ilkon, That his meyne schold [brynge] echon In-myddes Troie in a playn Be-fore the temple in a champayn. His batayles ther Ector arayed, With many gode kny&yogh;tes wel assayed; He ordeyned them MS. then . in batayles nyne With gode knyghtes & eke fyne, And set aboue hem gouernoures, Hardy kny&yogh;tes and gode gyoures. THe furst ost lad sir Glauntoun, A kyng sone of gret renoun; And Theseus, kyng of Tras MS. Tars . ; And Archilogo, that his sone was; Two thousand kny&yogh;tes gode and lele Lad thei in that eschele. 'I &yogh;eue &yogh;ow leue,' saide Ector, 'with this, To go & come with mochel blis: To &yogh;oure Enemys now &yogh;e hye, And come a-&yogh;eyn with victorye!' The &yogh;ate was open on a rees, Thei passed forth out of that prees. The secunde batayle lede Alkan, The kyng Antipe, that doughti man, A dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t, a noble kyng; The[i] hadde with hem in here ledyng Thre thousand knyghtes gode & strong; Thei rode alle forth In that throng, With many doughti man hem myd. He ordeyned then the batayle thrid, Thre thousand of dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;tes, That were hardy at alle ry&yogh;tes, And called gode Troyle, and to him spak And seyde: 'brother, I the be-tak \u00b6 Hic Ector et alii Reges Troiani ibant ad prelium. These gode men In thi kepyng, I praye oure goddis, a-&yogh;eyn &yogh;ow bryng!

TRoyle sayde in fair manere: '&YOGH;if my god me helpe, that is me dere, Ne haue &yogh;e of me no doute, I schal do &yogh;ow ther aloute, And do alle &yogh;oure comaundement, And kepe &yogh;oure heste in good entent.' He toke his leue as curtais and hende, To his Enemys he gan wende; His armes were gode and newe, His scheld was of Asure blewe, With thre lyons of gold schynand; Out of that &yogh;ate he &yogh;ede passand. \u00b6 Aboute these batayles Ector him paynes, The fourthe batayle MS. batayles . he ordeynes Of th[r]e thousand and hundres seuene, Off kny&yogh;tes gode\u2014by god of heuene!\u2014 With many a-nother dou&yogh;ti man, Vndir that dou&yogh;ti kyng Vpan; He was the strongest of that parti Saue Ector him-self, but Dares ly. \u00b6 The ffyfft batayle then Ector made Off stronge kny&yogh;tes and eke sade, Off doughti men with-oute ensoygne, That comen were out of Cesoygne; Thes ilke men were wonder stronge, As geauntes mochel and longe; The kynges armes were blewe and blo, With-oute other signes mo. \u00b6 He called to him Polimodas, A dou&yogh;ti kyng, that hardi was; He made him lord and her leder, And prayed god be her speder. \u00b6 The sixte batayle with-oute les Ledes Prosemen and Sterepes; Thei fau&yogh;t vn-armed in here atyres With longe Arwes and scharpe vires. He cleped Dephebus that folk to lede, And bad to hem to take good hede. He bad also to kyng Esdras, Opon his heued his helm to las; \u00b6 Kyng Esdras and kyng Philon Bothe thei dede her helmes on, And wende to that batayle rude With grete folk and multitude. Kyng Philon a noble cart, A wonder werk, made hade gart: It was clene and al yvore Bothe be-hynde and eke be-fore, Siluer and gold on aythe[r] whele Was layd aboute fair an[d] wele; Al was be-gon, syde and hemmes, Ful of riche precious gemmes; Suche a cart ne precious Saw neuere man, ne so gracious. That batayle lad Piktagorasen, With kyng Philon and kyng Esdrasen. The seuenthe batayle led Eueas, A strong kyng In euery plas, With a noble Amerale, That hete Eufen\u2014so sayth the tale.\u2014 \u00b6 The .viii. batayle led Paris, That Alysaundre het also y-wys, With the noble kyng of Perse, As Dares telles In his verse. Ector sayde to Alysaundre: 'Off the come al this foule sclaundre, For thi wyffes foule rape; I rede that thow wysly scape, That thow of hem be not dispised; Come not among hem vn-avised, Lete thyn ost be euer the by, That thi fomen come the not ny!' Paris seyde thenne: 'so god me rede, I schal do, as &yogh;e haue seyde; I schal be euere at thin heste.' Thei ride forth with many a crest, With many a baner by the wynde, Some of sable, som of Inde. \u00b6 Ector called to him blyue Off hardy kny&yogh;tes thosandes fyue, The stalworthest In Troye born; When thei come him byforn He made of hem the .ix. batayle. As Ector coude, he arayes hem wele, He bad hem be at his ledyng, Thei were wel glad of that biddyng. Ten of his brether that were hardye, He dede In that companye; Him-self MS. selt . was armed In helme & bryny, His stede by-gan wel loude to hyny. Gret Ioye was of Ector ffayrnes, Off his strengthe and his goodnes. Dars the heraud\u2014I the be-hote\u2014 Many meruayles of him he wrote. ECtor sat on Galathea, The swyfftest hors that myght ga; To his ffader Priamus Rode he thenne, and seyde thus: 'My lord, my fader leue and dere, A thousand knyghtes I leue &yogh;ow here With alle the pedel better and werre, That the Gregeis vs not sterre, To take oure toun with arte and scleght, The while we In feld feght. &YOGH;e ben wyse, good, and able, Loke &yogh;e be gode and defensable! I schal &yogh;ow sende with kny&yogh;tes and knapes, How the batayle with vs scapes; And afftir that I sende &yogh;ow sonde, Wele helpe &yogh;e vs, if nede be-stonde.' \u00b6 Kyng Priamus a&yogh;eyn answeres: 'I prey god, that alle thyng weres, Saue the this day fro dedly wounde And sende the a&yogh;eyn hole and sounde! God sende me gode tythandes & blys, For in the now al myn hope is, In thi wit and thi connyng, In thi strengthe and thi gouernyng.' At his fadur leue he toke, And with his batayle forth he schoke. ECtor rode forth In gode vertuus, Strong kny&yogh;t, hardy and prus, So hardy kny&yogh;t was non a-losed; Wel offte was he harde be-closed, Hic veniunt Greci ad Prelium. With the Gregeis alle vmbygon, That of his men hadde he not on; With hundres fele and thousandes bothe Thei swore his deth with many an othe. And he on fote, when his hors was sclayn,\u2014 &YOGH;it dar I for-sothe sayn, That non durst on him hond lay, Ne non so bold come In his way. His armes were faire and bry&yogh;t of hewe, His scheld was of Asure blewe, In-myddes his scheld a lyon stode, As rede as any blode. \u00b6 He markys him bothe body and brest With Appolyn that was to him trest. At his wendyng \u00fean was he last, Alle his batayles sone he past, Til he was formest of hem alle. The ladyes &yogh;ede opon the walle, Ther my&yogh;t thei se on euery syde, How the batayle scholde betyde. \u00b6 Ther was Eleyne, the faire qwene, Hectuba and Pollexene, And hir sustir Cassaunder; Opon the walles thei gan wander, For to se and to be-holde, How thei fau&yogh;t opon the wolde. AGame[n]on In his de-vyse MS. de-gyse . Hadde ordeyned wel alle hise; He hadde on horse, with pedales, Six & twenti grete batayles. The formast warde ledde Patrodus, A riche duk and a glorious; When he that batayle toke to kepe, Him hadde be betre layn to sclepe. He was Achilles alyaunce, And dede him gret greuaunce, For he was his sworen brother, So was that on to that other. \u00b6 The secunde ledde Diodemes, Kyng Menon, and Menescens. The thridde, the furthe, and eke the fifft Lad many a kyng that neuere hadde schrifft; Alle thei were dede, bothe duk and kyng; To telle her names were gret tariyng. \u00b6 Then come Nestor duk, and kyng Makaon; The laste of alle come Agemenon, Off ther ost as an Emperour And ther alther gouernour. \u00b6 Achilles bar non Armes that MS. thar . day, In his tent at home he lay For a wounde, In strong aray That he hadde cau&yogh;t that other day. \u00b6 Now haue thei take the feld large With helme, sword, and many targe, Lased strey&yogh;t in cote-Armures, Y-heled MS. y heled . with riche covertoures, Opon her stedes gaye trapped, With yren and stele that were wel clapped For dyntes of Arwes and schotyng; Many man dyed at that metyng. \u00b6 Many a baner was displayed, And many a stede aboute strayed Among that ost Maystirles, That ther lay ded, lyffles. Ther were schankes al to-schiuered, And many of his lyff delyuered, Bakkes broken, bones brosten, Many of here hors casten, \u00b6 Magnum bellum. Many a cote on erthe trayled, Many a wyff her lord ther wayled, When thei alle to-gedir mette, The archeres faste a-boute hem schotte, Thei sclow and wounded many a score. Ector rod his men be-fore And Priked his stede, as he were wode, That alle his sides ran on blode; So ful of yre as Ector was, When he saw so many come a-pas Off so many Gregeis in his syght, He wondred swythe, and so he myght. PAtrodus, a kyng gaylard, Was ledere of the vanward; Ector come as a lyoun, And Patrodus on a stede broun Vnto Ector be-fore his men, He strok his stede and dede him ren; He bar Ector thorow the scheld, But Ector faste his sadel held, In-to the flesche he him smot, And Ector to him [went] foot hot. \u00b6 He wex thenne wood and wroth I-now, Out of his schethe his sword he drow, He smot Patrodus on the hed, Styff ded he him leued. His strok with-stode no basenet, His strong helme, ne his palet, He cleff his heued atwo, And bad him smyte no more so. Doun on the grounde Patrodus fley Off his hors, that many it sey. \u00b6 Ector saw his Armes schon Off many a perle and riche ston; Doun of his stede Ector lyght That gode Armes to him dyght; He held his stede be the rayne, To spoyle the knyght that he hadde sclayne. \u00b6 Mennon led the ward the secunde, He saw Patrodus on the grounde, He saw Ector him wolde dispoyle, But rather him thouthe with him toyle; For Mennon to him ryght With thre thousand knyghtis bryght; Er he myght that body dispoyly, Michel wo was sikurly! MEnnon rode to Ector right euene And him myssayd with loude steuene, He spak to him wordes vnlede And seyde: 'thow wolff, thow art wel grede! Wenestow wynne that wyght rauyne, Certes his harneys schal neuere be thyne; Off this pray schaltow not tast, For thow schalt se comande in hast Fyffti thousand the to distroye, And alle thei thenke the to noye.' \u00b6 When Mennon hadde him myssayde, Alle the hepe on him layde, Thei thoght his stede fro him reue, And him to scle and ded leue; \u00b6 Thei &yogh;aff him many a stroke to holde, Thei made his knes vndir him ffolde, With fyne fors thei made him knele; Ector tho loked as a deuele: Maugre her tethe vp he ros A&yogh;eyn the wille of alle his fos, He cleue hem with his swordis egge, As man doth the tre with wegge. Many a bale he al to-rit MS. alto rit. , Many aboute kyng Menon flit; He toke his stede maugre her chekes, And afftir hem he sekes, Opon his heued a strok to wynde, A-mong his men &yogh;if he him fynde; In that prese hadde he him sene, He hadde on him venged bene. \u00b6 But then come kyng Theseus, And his sone Archilogus, And thre thousand knyghtes with bren bryght, And Ector thei felle on right; But he that formast to him ran, For-sothe he was a fey man: \u00b6 Ector sclow him hastyly, And alle other that come him by; The Troyens fau&yogh;t with gret force. Ector rod to the ded cors, That he furst sclow, that het Cartays, To reue him his harneys; The kyng of Grece,\u2014I vndirstonde\u2014 Come with knyghtes two thousande A&yogh;eyn Ector, and bad him let be: 'Thow schalt not haue his Armes with the.' \u00b6 Kyng Mennon come with moche route And be-sette Ector al aboute, Thei putte him certes fro his thoght, The harneys of him nedeth him noght; Loke afftir that, was it no bote. Ector whan he was on fote With many thousandes vmbyset, An hondrid Gregeis on him bet, As fele as myght him reche, But Ector toke euere on hem wreche: In many syde his swerd bared, And many an hed he of pared, He was so laid with armes and legges Als thikke as mire with segges, He smot of and maymed thore; He was be-set with Gregeis sore. \u00b6 Mennon toke MS. to ke. that ded body And lyfft it fro the erthe an hy, And bad his men be-fore him lay; And ther-with thei ride a-way And bare it home to his tent, For Ector scholde not haue his garnement. ECtor was strongly assayled, But al therfore nought availed; He wende he scholde not fro hem scape, But of his swerd euere thei lape. Ther was a kny&yogh;t, sir Gorioun, A stalworthe knyght, with sir Menoun; An hundrid were at his assent, To scle Ector, that was his entent, And fro him toke with-oute &yogh;ifft His noble stede that was so swyfft. But Ector sclow of hem ffyfftene With-Inne a while with his swerd kene, He defended him dou&yogh;htily A-&yogh;eyn hem alle ful my&yogh;thly. \u00b6 A Troyen stode be-syde lokande, He hadde two speres In his hande; And sone he caste that on, That hitte that kyng sir Gorioun, That fro his body &yogh;ede the soule; Delfully then gan he &yogh;oule. \u00b6 Another was on Ector brym, That other spere cast he at him, Thorow-out his Armure gert he it flye; Then thei of Troye be-gan to crye, To held Ector he cried and grad For that MS. For In that . perel that he was In stad. \u00b6 When Senabor, his brother, herde That Ector thus In batayle ferde, He hied faste In al his myght With al his ost In-to that fyght; Thorow hem alle he to hem presed And of that perel him relesed. Off his strong men that were myghti At his comyng were sclayn thritti, Off hem that hadde him vmbecast Thritti were ded, er thei past. \u00b6 Then delt Ector dyntes a-ri&yogh;t, Alle &yogh;ede to dethe that come in his sight; He wolde not longe dwelle In here dette, He sclow doun right alle that he mette. Alle &yogh;ede to dethe afftir that tyde, That were so bold his strok to abyde; He was with Ire so chaufed and het, His armes were al blod & al wet; He dalte aboute him large lyuere, Of his strokes was he so fre, That alle toke part that come him ner, Erle, duke, kny&yogh;t, & sqwyer. \u00b6 Many a riche amerayle Broght he that day to wrotherhayle And al his dole, many a knyght Toke her dethe with-oute respit. He fond no man wel many sithe, On wham he my&yogh;t his wratthe kythe. TRoyle was on that other syde And &yogh;af the Gregeis woundes wyde, He smot hem on that yren hat, That ney the heued ofte it sat. \u00b6 Then come to batayle Menescene, The noble duk of gode Athene; Thre thousand knyghtes were with him, Sturne knyghtes and grym. He saw Troyle fel hem of Grece, He rafft hem hondes, legges, and nece, He &yogh;aff hem many an euel pat, Menescen hadde dispite of that. \u00b6 He rode to him and hitte him lowe, And bare him ouer his sadel-bowe, That to the grounde doun of his stede \u2014Nolde or wolde\u2014Troyle &yogh;ede, And for-stonet and wolde swouny. Menescen made him \u00feo besy With alle his men and his power, Troyle to haue to his presoner; He put ther-to suche bysynes, That Troyle, that lay in duysenes, Was drawen out of hors trede, And Menescen forth-with him lede With mechel folk toward his prisoun; He wende, for him to haue raunsoun. THer was a kyng\u2014het Meseres\u2014 Saw the duk of Athenes Hath take Troyle, the kynges sone: \"Helpe him now, if that thei konne; &YOGH;iff thei her leder refuse, Iff he be taken In suche gyse.\" Echon loked thedirward, Thei saw thei ledde Troyle thenward; With loude voyce thei hem a-scryed, And duk Mescene, he hem defyed. He rode to him that Troyle hath sayled, And with his spere to him taled: He bare him thorow lyuere and longe, He spak neuere afftir with tonge. \u00b6 The kyng Antipe smot duk Mescene; Nadde his armes the strenger bene, Ne scholde he neuere haue spoken word, Ne bred eten at no bord. Thes kynges two with her power Delyuered Troyle of that daunger, Thei sclow of hem a gret parti; And Troyle was horsed with gret hy, He dede him horse amonges hem alle This line follows the next one in MS. . Then be-gan Mescene to calle Afftir help to Gregeis stale; But ther-of Troyle &yogh;aff no tale, But fro his power is he refft, Ther to come thenk he not efft. I dar sothe say with-oute borwe: Menescen hath then gret sorwe. When he has thus his presoner lorn, To his mouthe he sette his horn; \u00b6 In his horn blew he a blaste, His men assemblent aboute him faste; He prayed hem wel hertely: \"That thei schuld him helpe stalworthly, To venge him on the kyng Troyene, He hadde don him schame and tene.\" He strok forth as a dragoun And felde Troyens be-fore him doun; As he rode In his wode res, He met a&yogh;eyn him Meseres, The knyght that made him Troyle tyne, On him wodly he rolled his eyne. He felde him with a spere of Mapul Among the feet of many capul, He preked forth and lefft him thore, For he myght harme him no more. Vnto another he tho turned, That of his hors sone he fondred. \u00b6 Then come he to helpe stalward With alle his men the toun toward, With alle his feloun Oripisus; A-&yogh;eyn hem come Archilaus With the kyng Procenore\u2014 Off wham I haue told of byfore;\u2014 Hard batayle ther was sene Off ffoure kynges hem be-twene. POllymodas with-oute dwellyng With alle the men of his ledyng Afftir that MS. tho that. come out of Troye, With mechel ffairnes and mochel Ioye, With many an hors and on fote, Some to sclynge and som to schote. Afftir that come kyng Remus, A-&yogh;eyn him come kyng Menelaus; Kyng Remus brought thousandes thre Kny&yogh;tes gode to that semble, \u00b6 Menelaus brought suche two And many man on fote also. These kynges two to-gedur rode With kene speres with-oute abode, Vp &yogh;ede thair feet & heued doun, To the grounde &yogh;ede the croun. \u00b6 Pollimodas rod to Merenes, With his spere he him scles; He was of elde of twenti &yogh;ere, And Eleyne Cosyn leue and dere, In his &yogh;outhehed and his floures, Hardi, styf, and strong In stoures. \u00b6 Menelaus saw that he was ded; It was to him a carful red, In his grete tene he smot Remus; Opon his hed he smot him thus, That thorow his helme he cleue his veyne; His men wende, he hadde ben sclayne, He was smeten to the eye, His men wende, he schuld dye; Thei toke here red then to fle And wente her way and let him be. \u00b6 Polymodas hem made abyde, He bad: \"thei scholde a&yogh;eynward ryde;\" He seyde: 'it is &yogh;oure vylony, Fle ffro &yogh;oure lord so schamfully!' Thei turned a&yogh;eyn at his byddyng, Thei wolde haue ben wel Iangelyng At home with strokes seuene or eygte Then ben there among that fighte. A-mong the horses ther lord thei found With mochel sorwe and hard stounde; Men helde him ouerthwert, For he was brosed hed & hert; Some toke abouen and some benethen, Wel seke and sore bere thei him thethen. THere was a kyng\u2014het Cilydis\u2014 The fairest man that lyued y-wys, So fair a man was non on lyue; His fairnes myght no man discryue, No man myght his fairnes say, Ne with no colour hit portray. Celidis smot Polimodas, That Antenores sone was: \u00b6 Adhuc magnum bellum. He rode to him to his vnprowe With a spere stalwo[r]the and towe, \u00b6 Polidomas to the erthe he bare Off his hors, er he were ware; Polidomas ful wroth vp-sterte, He pulled him by the skirthe, He sette a strok vnder his choke, That he myght neuere afftir loke; For men myght se his tethe al white. He lay ther ded as a kyte. Ector ffel[d] the while and sclow Alle that euere aboute him drow, He felde and sclow the Gregeis euere, Off al that day he sesed neuere; He sesed neuere sethen he began, He rod a-boute fro man to man. If I durst say: the Gregeis blod, That he hadde sclayn, a-boute him stod In eche a batayle that he rod thorow, As wynter water doth in forow. \u00b6 Ther come a kyng ridynge a-cost In help of Grece with alle his ost, With many a kny&yogh;t hard & smert; He toke Ector at discouert With a spere, was not lyght, That made his mayles vnright, It roff In-two and brast In-sonder; It was a strok lyke a thonder. That yren was scharp and stalworthe, With that strok Ector hurte he. \u00b6 Ector loked on him wrothly, He cried afftir MS. afftir afftir. him hertly: 'A-byde, thow coward kyng Tentan, For the love MS. lowe. of thi lemman! A-byde and stond a strok of me, As I haue don of the!' Tentan was so sore aferd, He nolde abyde for al mydelherd, He prekyd away ouer the valowe As swyfft as any swalowe. \u00b6 As he rod affter walopande, In his way mette he comande A riche lord, an Amerayle; Ector him felde\u2014the sothe to tale\u2014 He cleue his bodi In parties, That ded of his [hors] he syes. \u00b6 The Gregeis then sprede Ector wyde, Fyue thousand on euery syde, Thei thoght him take or to sle, Thei Iuged him alle quyk to fle; But he &yogh;aff not a flax-bete Off alle her bost ne thaire threte; With him was non that to him longed. Many a strok thei of him fonged, Many a body he cleff also, And many made he hedles ther-to. THeseus was a kyng of Grece, In euery syde Ector he sece Alle with Gregeis stoute; He bad him: \"of that presse go oute;\" He bad him with wordes hende: 'I warne the as thi ffrende,\u2014 That the mys-falle non euel hap,'\u2014 \"Ne that he fel In that trap, It were a los to alle that were, &YOGH;iff that \u00feat kny&yogh;ht mys-ffere.\" \u00b6 Ector him thonked with mylde mode, For he was kyng curteis and gode, He thonked him of his gode wille; Ector loked his men tille, He saw the kyng Menelaus And the kyng Thelamanyus A-semble to Palodomas, That in the prese fer fro him was; He herde mochel noyse & cry, Ector wiste wel ther-by, Polydomas was feld and taken; He stroke his stede ouer the laken, Er he come ther, wold he not lette. With the Gregeis wel sone he mette, Polidomas thei were a-boute, He &yogh;aff hem many a sore cloute. \u00b6 He sclow ffyffty MS. ffyffty. with-Inne a throwe, He ffelde hem ded as foules of snowe; Thei ffled away that Power hadde, For fere of him thei were al madde; \u00b6 Polidomas thei lete quyte go, Off his takyng schope hem gret wo. THen come the kyng Episcrepus With alle his men, and Menelaus,\u2014 Thelamonius before is named,\u2014 Alle her men thei haue a-samed; With harde strokes thei hem assayled, The Troyens ther her myght fayled; The saut was hard and so dredful, The Troyens saw it was nedful: For then thei fle and lefft the feld, Or elles be dede ther vndir scheld. \u00b6 Then anon with-oute dwellyng Thei turned a-way alle fleyng, Thei ne myght with-stonde that sau&yogh;t. Ector him-self a-&yogh;eyn hem fau&yogh;t; Hic Ector fecit magnum bellum MS. This line in black, not in red; in the right corner, not in the middle; very small. . The Gregeis cam thenne enviroun, \u00b6 Ector ffau&yogh;t as [a] lyoun, Alle the hepe to him a-croched. For ther was non that him aproched, For who-so come with-Inne his swerde, Sodan deth was his werde. Off alle the Gregeis that pursued first Was non so bold, that ones durst Ones opon him hondes lay; Alle his men were fled a-way; \u00b6 Thei hadde sclayn his stede him vnder. I dar wel say: he sclow an hundred, He reffte many bothe legges and thies, Hed and schuldres, armes & knees; Ther lay aboute him hondes & knokeles As thikke as any honysocles, That In somer stondes In grene medes; Many a wyff made he wedewes, Many a lady lordles; He fau&yogh;t with more and eke with les, \u00b6 But he was euere liche ffresche. Alle at ones thei on him thresche, Dartes kest and put with speres, But Ector euere his bodi weres; Was non so bold, durst come him nere, The whiles he myght his armes stere. FAls Gregeis, to &yogh;ow I speke: If &yogh;e ben ought, now &yogh;ow a-wreke! Now may &yogh;e &yogh;oure strengthe kythe On him that greues &yogh;ow offte sithe! He is on fote, his stede is sclayn, On fote he wil not fle a&yogh;eyn, For al the gold of Galilee He wol not ffro &yogh;ow fflee. &YOGH;e ben aboute him ten thousand, How may &yogh;e for schame lete him stand? A-&yogh;eyn &yogh;ow alle on creature!

Gret schame is, if he thus gon! \u00b6 Alas Achilles, that wicked dede, That sclow him MS. him very small over line. so in vnmanhede! It was certes non honour, But reproue and gret clamour, That ten thosand my&yogh;t him not falle, Ther he stode amonges hem alle. \u00b6 The Troyens were fro Ector fled, His bretheren faste afftir him gred, Among her men faste him sought, But thei con fynde him nought. A-mong the Gregeys thei him fond Be-set with mo then .x. thousand, That wold him take or elles qwelle; But Alle thei myght him not felle. \u00b6 A-mong Gregeys the prese thei brake, Many an hed ther gan thei crake; His on brother Damaderoun Rode to a duk Polirasoun, That rod on a stede mechel & strong; Damaderoun vnto him sprong, He &yogh;aff the duk a cruste of brede, That he fel doun and lefft his stede. Damaderoun was not ydel, He toke the stede by the brydel, Ther-with faste he him spede, And to Ector he him ledde. ECtor lepe on his stede ronke, And seyde: 'brother, I can the thonke.' Dephebus come to that saut With alle the men him was be-taut, With arwes brode, bowe and qwyuere; With him come many a man delyuere MS. & delyuere. . To that saut thei were wel rakel, Eche man made redi his takel, Bende her bowes and set her flone; Among the Gregeis thei gert hem gone. \u00b6 Many a Gregey was euel atyred, With brode MS. browe. arwes al to-vired MS. alto vired. ; Thei wounded hem with arwes brode. The Troyens then forth rode With gret comforth vnto that fyght, That wel-ney before were discomfyght. \u00b6 Dephebus wounded kyng Thentan In his visage, that it wex wan; Dephebus wounded him so sore, That he ther-on thought euere-more. \u00b6 Whyntelle and kyng Moderne Theseus kyng sey fro ferre, Woundyng Troyens and sore bete, And many on her lyff lete; Bothe thei swore with grete stryff, Thei wolde reue Theseus his lyff. The ton rod to him with maltalent, That of his hors doun he went; He fel doun, and thei him toke, Thei thoght him scle with grymly loke. But Ector bad: \"thei schold late be,\"\u2014 'Lete him go qwite he dede for me!' \u00b6 Hic Cassibalanus Filius Regis Troiani occisus est. Theseus was neuere so glad, As when Ector his men bad; He thonked him an hundred sithe, To his Gregeis he rode blyue. T has been washed out, but is distinctly legible. THen come thedir kyng Thoas, I-armed bright MS. br ight. as any glas; Fyue thousande knyghtes com with him wyght Off bolde Gregeis In-to that ffyght, With sword and spere, gauelok and staff. Many a strok Gregeis ther &yogh;aff; Thoas smot Cassibalanes, That he fel doun opon the danes. \u00b6 Ector was [right] sori than, When he sei ded Cassibalan; He was his brother borne abast, He saw him lye & had lost his tast. Might Ector Thoas haue reched, Schuld neuere man haue him teched, Not Ypocras with alle his scleyght; But Thoas flede MS. felde. with al his [myght]. Ector sorow myght no man sclekke, He smot In-two many a nekke. \u00b6 Then come Nestor with thousandes ffyue,\u2014 As faste as he my&yogh;t dryue,\u2014 Off hardi kny&yogh;tes gode and bolde; Amonges hem alle was non suche holde, His MS. He is. hore for elde waxen was gray; But he come thedur In good aray. \u00b6 A&yogh;eyn him come kyng Esdras, Kyng Philon, and Reconitas MS. reconitas, r quite dis|tinct, but cp. l. 5511, and the note on l. 530 (p. 16). ; When thei to-gedur were then met, Many on was to grounde bet, Thei died faste on bothe sydes; But Philon thenne a-mong hem rides With his swerd In honde drawen, Many Gregeis did he on dawen. The Gregeis vmbikest his cart With many a kny&yogh;t hardi and smart, Thei toke Philon, his helm vnlased, The gold was of his cart defased With grete strokes set ther-on, Thei hasted faste to scle Philon. \u00b6 Iecomytas I quite distinct in MS., but cf. l. 5498. was ful of wo, That Philon scholde with Gregeis go; He saith: 'Esdras, for him vs wroght! How thei of Grece\u2014ne sese thow noght\u2014 Haue take Philon and led a-way? Helpe we him, if that we may!' \u00b6 The Troyens thanne at here callyng Among Gregeis made gret hurlyng, Thei delt strokes for her frendes And refft Philon of her bendes. EVeas come with alle his folk, With spere and swerd and gauelok, With alle his kny&yogh;tes and his men, And her leder, duke Eufren. \u00b6 Ayax rode to Eueas, And he to him a gret pas, As harde as thei may ride; Wolde nother of hem lenger abide. Thei stroke to-gedir with so gret myght, That bothe vpon here pol lyght. \u00b6 Ector toke to Eueas hede, And saw he hadde lorn his stede; He rod to him faste prikande With his drawen swerd in hande, He dede Eueas his swerd take, And sclow the Gregeis for Ayax sake. Here armes vayled not an hoppe, He smot In-two bothe chanel and choppe; He sclow an hundrid then and mo, Thei were so ferd, that alle tho Be-gan bacward to fle, Thei durst not ones with eye him se. \u00b6 Ayax thoght, he was be-swyked, When his men a-way priked; In his hert hadde he gret wo, He wiste not what for to do; He loked on bak toward here stale. So mery was neuere Nightyngale Syngand In no hasel-crop, Ne no child playing with his top MS. thop. , As Ayax was that ilke tyde, When he hadde loked him be-syde: \u00b6 He saw be-hynde him stondyng right A ffresche Gregey, that was neuere aflyght Out of that stede, toward that fyght With twenti thousand rekened aryght; Ther was the flour of chiualrye Off Grece certes and Thesalye. Vnto that batayle come thei hard With baneres brode and here standard; Ayax schewed his men that sight And bad hem for schame fyght. THe kyng come then of Cassedone, To helpe Ayax with-oute essoyne; He broght with him to that poyne Off gode knyghtes thousandes tweyne. \u00b6 The same tyme come thedur also With bothe her ostes kynges two, With hem come thousandes seuene; &YOGH;et leffte be-hynde twyes eleuene That al the day thenne hadde rest; Off hem of Grece were thei the best. \u00b6 Then were the Troyens wel weri, Thei myght not MS. now. for weri hem steri, Thei were so for-fou&yogh;ten, that hem was wo; Thei thoght alle aweyward go. \u00b6 But Paris come thenne with his tropel MS. torpel. , With alle his knyghtes hardi and fel. Kyng Philicais Ector a-vised, How he Gregeis sclow & bursed; He rode to him with tene & hate, To dere Ector come he to late; To Ector with his spere he soughte, But Philicais that strok boughte, Ector rod to him a&yogh;eyn And smot him thorow the bak and brayn, That he neuere afftir grunt; He was ded afftir that dunt. THen come [to] the batayle kyng Humere MS. humore , but cf. ll. 5705, 5709, 5718, 11391. With many a cheld and brod banere, With alle his kny&yogh;tes, and Vlixes That alle that day hadde rest in pes, So did the kyng sir Humelyne; With him come many dredful hyne. Kyng Pollidari and Macheroun, With alle his ost Agamenoun, \u00b6 The kyng of Cypre, kyng Rody, Come with many a man \u00feat was mody; To ffyght come kyng Henes, With alle his men Philotenes, \u00b6 Kyng Hencus and many other, Diodemes with his brother,\u2014 Al that day stode as oxe in stalle,\u2014 Now be thei comen to batayle alle. Agamenon he was the laste; Now ben thei alle to batayle paste. But Ector helpe, the Troyens ben spilt\u2014 I telle hem,\u2014elles alle be kylt, But doughti Ector hem rescowe; Many of her bakkes now schal bowe, For sixti thousand ther ben or mo MS. or now mo. Off ffresche Gregeis to batayle ago. PAris smot the kyng of Frese, With alle his mayles he gan lese; He smot him with a spere off beche, That he fel doun with-oute speche. Ther was del with-oute play, Mechel cry and weylaway, The Gregeis were for him ful wo; Vlixes thrette Paris to sclo\u2014 The kyng of Frese was his cosyn, He was of Vlixes kyn,\u2014 He rode to him with gret envye, To take on Paris Maystrye: He sclow his hors, he fel to grounde, That was better than an hundrid pounde. \u00b6 Troyle saw Paris feld, In poynt of dethe, or elles him &yogh;eld; In his front he him smot, The blod start out fot hot, He set on him a foule seme; By his face ran doun the strem Off rede blode, but not-for-that Vlixes In his sadel sat, Of his hors fel he not doun, He smot to Troyle with gret randoun, And In his visage he him smyt, A wicked strok\u2014he him hit. Ector rode euere to and fro, He made Gregeis blak and blo; Alle that day aboute he rode Fro ost to ost, he neuere abode; He loked to his owne eschele, He saw the Gregeis with him dele, \u00b6 He saw hem dreuen out of that place. Ector seyde tho: 'Alace!' Al that day hadde thei ther ben, Might thei her mayster not sen, Out of the feld gan thei hem dresse, Thei hadde so fou&yogh;ten, thei were mygh[t]les. Whether he were wroth, myght no man aske; He rode to hem bothe wode & thraske, He spak to hem wordes mylde: 'Louely lordes, god it schilde, Fer to ffle; what haue &yogh;e thoght? Haue &yogh;e for-&yogh;ete, ne thenke &yogh;e noght, What schame the Gregeis haue &yogh;ow don? Helpes now alle quyk & soun MS. som. , Turnes a&yogh;eyn boldely with me!

And whan here lord was to hem come, Thei wende wel rather to be for-nome, Thei swore to him that\u2014so helpe hem god\u2014 Thei schal neuere [fle] for euene ne for od. ECtor brew the Gregeys bale, He ledde his men doun by a vale A-gayn quayntly to the batayle; Thei be-gan the Gregeis to assayle; To \u00fee Gregeis ffresche and so quykly, That thei died thanne thikly; For Ector thenne euere hem to dethe wounded, With-outen ende he hem confounded. Thoas, that sclow Cassibalan, Among the Troyens MS. gregeis. he rode and ran, As hundes doth vpon his pray, He did gret harm opon hem that day. \u00b6 Qwyntelyne hadde him aspied, Loude to his bretheren he cried: 'That is the theff, oure brother sclow, Scle him anon amonges &yogh;ow now! Let him not go now al quyt With-oute dethe or som dispyt!' \u00b6 Thei rod alle to kyng Thoas, Hem was ful loth to lete him pas; Thei bare him doun, his swerd was broken, As he amonges hem was loken; His hed was bare, his helme was rached, Thei scholde for euere him haue tached, Ne hadde ben duk Menescene; He halp him, and that was wel y-sene: \u00b6 He smot Qwyntelyne opon the hat, His hors bak he loste with that, Aboute Thoas for he was most; He MS. A. felde another with-oute bost. PAris than be-gan to hale A strong arwe vp to the vale, To Menescen he drow that flot, In-myddis his ribbes wel sore he smot. Duk Menescen therfore ne lefft, Til he hadde Thoas fro hem reff[t], With many woundes and many a clyt Ther the bretheres hadde him hyt. \u00b6 Kyng Humere was almost wode, That Ector spilt so moche blode; \u00b6 Hic venit Priamus Rex ad prelium. He cleff Gregeis as men do swyn, He made of hem gret moryn. \u00b6 Humeres MS. Humer . bowe was redy bent, Him hadde ben better, it hadde ben brent; A scharp Arwe ther-Inne he set And so to Ector he hit schet, He hitte him euene In his visage; But Ector quyt him his wage, He hitte him on his helme aboue, Hit roff to-gederes as a gloue; The strok &yogh;ede to his herte colke, Humere fel doun a-monges his folke, He bente neuere affter arblast ne bowe, To schete ouer hilles ne ouer lowe. \u00b6 The Gregeis hadde gret angryng, That thei myght not him MS. hem . to dethe bryng, With her men so foule he ferd; Thei hadde him offt amonges hem spered, Ther were kny&yogh;tes aboute him kene Hundres mo then ffyfftene; But he was not of hem abast, Opon him-selff mechel he trast, To make him way who-so nolde, And wende away euere whan he wolde. ECtor lefft ffyghtyng al to-gedur And wente hom to his fadur, And bad: \"he scholde with-oute distaunce Come with alle his puruyaunce, That were leff[t] with-Inne the walles.\" Priamus then his men calles, He brought thre thousand fresch & rested, Among the Gregeis In thei thrested; Thei sclow ther many a gret sire, When thei were comen In that toptyre. Ayax rod to Ector fast, That bothe his speres In-sonder brast, Ther hors fel doun and thei &yogh;ede ouer, Bothe were besy up to couer. \u00b6 Menelaus sclow that tyde An MS. And . Emerayl on Troyens syde; Ector brother Celydonias Sclow the kynges sone Thoas; His half-brother Madoun of Clare Smot kyng Ced opon the bare, He smot him so opon the snoute, That bothe his eyen wenten oute. \u00b6 His other half-brother, Sir Sadolle, A riche Gregay smot In that soille, That his harneis & his haterell Opon the grounde al blody fell. Another of hem, Margaritoun, Felde the while sir Thelamoun; But Thelaman at that Iustyng Made the blode out of him spryng. \u00b6 Famel bare Procenor doune, He hitte him sore vpon the croune. \u00b6 Duglas ran to Menescen With gret envye and Mechel ten, He hitte him with a stalworthe spere, But he my&yogh;t him not doun bere; Menescen smot a-&yogh;ein Duglas With his swerd In-myddes the fas,\u2014 His viser vayled not worth a pese,\u2014 He wounded him in-myddes the nese. \u00b6 Diamor saw his brother blede, He thoght quyte Menescen his mede, He smot him vndir his hors bely; Then he was ferd, hit was no ferly: For then come the brother thridde; Menescen hadde than mys-be-tydde, Ne hadde Tentan come to his socouryng, He hadde be brou&yogh;t to his endyng. \u00b6 Menescen was feld, but op he ros, He faught faste a&yogh;eyn his fos, He fau&yogh;t a&yogh;eyn hem alle thre, But myght it not so longe be, For on his scheld was many an hole, He my&yogh;t not longe that trauayle thole. \u00b6 Tentan saw his grete myscheue, He was In poynt of euel preue, Menescen myght was almost wast, Tentan rod to him In hast And halp Manascen, that fau&yogh;t sore, A&yogh;eyn Duglas and Diamore. ECtor saw, that Tentan was Comen to helpe a-&yogh;eyn Duglas, He thought hem bothe to encombre; Him hadde ben better In-myddes Humbre, Then he hadde it at his wille, Thei my&yogh;t haue rongen here soule-knylle. \u00b6 Ector was with him ful wroth; Thei hadde dyed for-sothe both, Ne hadde y-come Ayax; And In his hond he brou&yogh;t an ax, The schafft was bounden, long was the bit, Many a strok smot he ther-myt. \u00b6 A Thousand knyghtes alle at ones Fel on Ector as bryddes in grones MS. groues (?). , To saue Menescen and kyng Tentan; For that sauyng died many a man. \u00b6 Ector him hew as fflesch to pot, The Gregeis died as schep In rot. \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit Regem Merionem. He was Iustice, deth was her dome, Ector made aboute him rome, Then fel gret encombraunce For Tentan kyng delyueraunce. \u00b6 The Gregeis turned and fro him fledde, Thei were so sore of him aferde, Thei myght no-thyng a-&yogh;eyn him stonde; He sclow that tyme a ful thousande. Merion Cp. l. 4997 sqq., where his name is Mennon. kyng come In his way, Ector him smyte he thoughte asay, For he bar Patrodus him fro, His lyff he dede ther for-go. ECtor saw, that it was he, He swor by his godis dygnite: \"He schuld neuere afftir him chide, He schal a-bye his foule Pride!\" 'Say, thow fals faytour, Thow losenger, thow fals traytour! Now is comen thin endyng-day, Thow that bar Patrodus a-way!' He rod to him and made him stoupe, He bar him ouer his hors croupe. \u00b6 Ector lyght a-doun In hy And smot his hed fro the body; He saw his armes delytable, Fair, and clene, and amyable, Ector stod and hem vndid,\u2014 Sixti thousand, & he In-myd Duk Menescen ther-of was war, How he Merioun dispoyled thar; He rode to him and smot him depe,\u2014 For Ector toke to him no kepe,\u2014 With a spere he him trauersed, That alle his armes thorow he persed; He &yogh;aff Ector an hidous sore, Menescen fley ther-fore, He nolde not Ector longe abyde, Away he gan faste ryde. ECtor wiste him hurt he feled, He rod on-syde and him keled; So wisly his wounde he bond, That no blode ther-of wonde. He rode a-&yogh;eyn to that baret, And many a man to dethe he bet. \u00b6 For Dares telles In his bokes, As man may se that ther-In lokes: Or euere he belan affter the wounde, He sclow of kny&yogh;tes In a stounde Passyng mo than ten hunder; Off man was neuere so moche wounder. \u00b6 The Gregeis were so for-dalled, So for-fou&yogh;ten, and so for-palled, Thei hadde no wil hem to defende, To dye echon ful wel thei wende. The Gregeis flow vnto here tentis, Mochel sorwe and wo thei hentes, For Troyens hem folwed thorow tent & hale And bare a-wey harneys and male. \u00b6 Thei robbed clene al that thei founde And sente To Troye many fair sonde Off gold, siluer, & riche druri, That thei fond In coffres and ty; Thei leffte ther nother pot ne panne, Dische ne dobler, cuppe ne kanne, Pece ne Maser, ne riche Mesures, Thei fond ther wel riche armures; \u00b6 Thei myght onethes a-wey wagge With siluer and gold, walet & bagge, \u00b6 Hic Greci ffugerunt Ectorem. With riche gold and other vessel, A-wey thei bere hit euerydel. Thei sette ffir In schip and fflune; The Gregeis made a rewful dune. That day the Troyens were glad, Lord! the Ioye that thei mad! \u00b6 But Ector was that day vnblessed, Off grace certes that day he myssed, He myght that day the batayl haue ent And alle the Gregeis clene haue schent, That thei schulde neuere haue passed the see With lyff ne lym to here contre; But destene, that fortune ledes, When he beholdis that men best spedis With sicur traist of wel spedyng, He makes hem leue somtyme a thyng That he may haue at his wille, That he schal neuere come ther-tille. ME rewes of Ector namely, That myght that day wel sicurly Haue sclayn alle his enemys, And hem scomfited at [d]euys, And al on-hap MS. op hap . haue put a-way Fro him and his, euere and ay; For I haue herd offte say, That he that wil not whan he may, When he wolde, he getis it noght, Then hit were ful faire be-sought, Som tyme, as good hap nere, That comes not ones In seuene &yogh;ere. \u00b6 Ector forsoke this grace also, Ne myght he neuere come ther-to; But fortune is fficul and frele, \u00b6 Exempla The sign in blue, the word in red paint, in MS. in the left margin. .

AS he rode chasynge hem of Grece, And myght haue hewen hem to pece, And saued him fro alle perel That him and his ther-afftir fel, He met a&yogh;eyn him comyng right His Aunte sone, that Ayax hight. In the tyme of Lamedon His Aunte was rauysched with Thelamon; He held here longe In payrement And gat sir Ayax verament. He knewe Ector, and Ector him, He hadde elles for-gon his beste lym. \u00b6 Ector seyde: 'my dere cosyn, Come to Troye and se thi kyn: Kyng Priamus, that is thin em, And his Baronage, and his barnetem. Gret worschepe\u2014so god me saue!\u2014 Shaltow In Troye amo[n]ges hem haue.' \u00b6 Hic Ector concedit Ayax [ sic ] peticionem suam. Ther-with-al seyde Ayax: 'nay! But, dere Cosyn, I the pray,\u2014 As thow me louest and art curtais,\u2014 No more harme do thes Gregeis! But let hem be this day in pes, And bid thin men that thei wol ces!' \u00b6 Ector thanne with mochel vnsele Graunted his askyng euery dele: Ector bar a litel ruet, Vnto his mouth his horn he set, Twyes or thries ther-In he blew; Wo were his men, when thei hit knewe, Thei leff[t] her chase and schippis brennyng, And come to him faste rennyng With sorwe & kare and mochel wo, That thei ne myght the Gregeis sclo. \u00b6 Thei rode the Cite than tille, And sikurly this was the skille, The victorie that thei for-&yogh;ede And myght neuere afftir so wel spede; Ne hadde he graunted Ayax prayere, Schuld neuere Gregeis hadde powere, Off he were comen of his blod, That euere he wolde be so wod. TRoyens hadde here &yogh;ates stoken, With barre and bolt wel y-loken, Wel sekur arre thei wel kept, That, when men were In bedde and sclept, The Gregeis scholde hem not brest And wake hem so of her rest. In here bed sclept thei not longe, The Troyens, when the day spronge, Were Armed alle and redy dight, To wende a&yogh;eyn to that fyght. But Gregeis hadde ther-to no nede, Thei sent to Troye & asked and bede, If that her consail wolde hit loke, Treus to haue an .viij. woke. \u00b6 Priamus and his consayl Graunted the treus with-oute fayle, And swor to holde hit stable and ferme The treus in pes lastyng the terme. Gregeis were fayn of that grauntyng, For thei hadde nede of soiornyng; When thei hadde treuse, thei sought the feld, Ther thei hadde foughten; thei be-held The bodyes MS. boydies . that ther ded lay, That hadde be sclayn In fight that day; Ther come of hem a foul sauour And smot to hem a gret rancour. But thei did wele and wrought wisly Off the bodyes that were grisly, Thei wroght best to here be-houe, Tho that thei wolde thei toke and groue, And alle the other with fyr thei brent; Many a man his frend be-ment. AChilles made both euen & morwe For Patrodus wel mochel sorwe, But it was longe, or his del sclaked; A riche tombe for him thei maked, And layde ther-on that cors present With gret wepe and wayment The last four letters added by another hand; the careless copyist saw the rhyme-words of the next lines and wrote way only. . Thei made also of Marbul gray Another tombe, ther-on to lay \u00b6 The doughti kyng Prothesalye, That Ector sclow In his folye; With gret worschepe and reuerence Thei made aboute him gret dispence. \u00b6 And thei of Troye that wounded wore, Thei heled woundes lesse and more, The while the trewe be-twene hem last, Thei toke medecyn and heled hem fast; By that the treus were al gon, Thei were amended euerychon. \u00b6 But Priamus myght not drynke ne ete, For he myght not for-gete Off his sone Cassibalane, He cursed faste that was his bane; He dede make a tombe I-wys In the temple of Veneris, Crafftly coruen and wel endent MS. ed inserted after endent , very dim and indistinct, as if blotted out at once after writing. , And layd him In that monument With carful herte and sore mornyng; Hit refft him many a nyghtes sclepyng. THe terme is gon now of treus, Some it likes and some it reus; Thei ben bothe y-dyght In feld & toun With helm and scheld and haberioun, To the fight a-&yogh;eyn to fare; Off bothe parties thei ben thare. Agamenon was gretly carked In his office, his men he &yogh;arked Euerychon vnto that fyght, Thei ben alle armed & redy dight. \u00b6 The ffirst batayle lad Achilles, The secunde Diodemes, Menelaus lad the thridde With many dou&yogh;ti men him mydde, The furthe batayle lad Menesenes That was lord of riche Athenes, And that other he wel ordeyned And with his goddis he hem sayned, And bad hem gon In here name, Here foos to schenschip and to schame. ECtor was besy and tentyff, To ordeyne hise, to saue her lyff: The furst batayle In kepyng hadde Doughti Troyle, so Ector badde; In alle that other gouernayle Ordeyned he, as most myght avayle. With his goddis he hem merked, And alle his men he forward ferked Out of the toun toward that place, Ther thei scholde fight with sword & mace. The Gregeis were with-oute the dikes, With swerd and staff [&] with pikes; Achilles led the formast warde, As is als it were a lyparde. Ayther of hem knewe other wele; Thei rode MS. Theirode . to-gyder as men vnsele, Thei were bothe mychel and strong of my&yogh;t; Thei rod to-gederes at all ri&yogh;t With kene speres and wel y-grounde, That bothe thei fel on the londe. But Ector start vp anon And to his sadel he gan gon, \u00b6 Ector lepe on his hors bak, He hadde vertues with-oute lak; He sclow of the Gregeis many a score, As he hadde ydon before, He woundes and sles & maymes many, Vnnethes he leues stondyng any In any stide ther he may mete; Thei caste at him and arwes schete, A thousand men on him smyte, But sword on him wol non bite: Fro stide to stide aboute he wynces, He slees kynges, dukes, & princes; Thei ffle fro him as ffox to hole, No man may his strokes thole; He is so wete with blode of men, That no man may his armes ken. AChilles ros vp afftirward, He toke his hors & lepe vpward, To hem of Troye gan he gange, Him thoght gret schame he lay so lange; Among Troiens did he gret harm, He wounded hem in body and arm, He ran amonges hem as a roo, He sclow manye & wounded moo, He hurt hem som & nolde not spare. As he rod thus, he was ware How E tor ferde with his Gregeis, He wounded MS. wonuded . hem and sclow al weys; \u00b6 He thoght he wold efft with him Iuste, He hadde to Ector a ful gret luste. But Ector &yogh;aff him suche a but, And fro his hors Ector him put, That he fel to the grounde as a cat, Wel euen vpon his ketil-hat. \u00b6 Ector wolde his hors haue sesed, But so fele men aboute him presed, Ther were so many his hors to defende, That Ector myght not come ther hende. \u00b6 Achilles ros and gret dele made, For he his hors lorn hadde; His men his stede to him broght, Ne hadde thei y-be, he ne hadde him noght; He taketh him and on him lepes, And sprong a&yogh;ein among the hepes \u00b6 Hic Ector et Achilles pugnauerunt. Off his Gregeis, ther Ector stode; Fau&yogh;t so faste, that stremes of blode Ran in forwes ther of leyes, Many a man be-fore him dyes. With alle the myght that euere he wan Achilles smot to Ector than, With bothe his handes, with sword naked, He smot Ector, that his hed craked, That with the strok Ector enchyned; But Ector not his stiropes tyned, Noght In his sadel ones Icched, Noght for that ones he quycched. \u00b6 His hert gret angur surmounted, That Achilles was remounted, And suche a strok sithen him &yogh;aue; He thoght he scholde another haue: He turned his hors wel smartly And smot to him wel hertly, He smot him on his hed on hy, The blod ran doun by his eye; He brak his helm and his hed als, The stremes of blode ran by his hals. \u00b6 Ayther on other began to hewe, Here strong myght on other to schewe; A delful fight was ther by-gonne, Hadde thei hadde rome, thei hadde not belonne, Vnto thei bothe, or that on, Hadde ben hewed as fflesche and bon; Hadde no man comen hem be-twene, Then scholde men the better haue sene. But then come thedur Diodemes And saw that no man myght hem ces; With alle his men he neuere bylynned, Til he hadde hem a-twynned MS. at twynned . . Certes I holde he did synne, That he hem parted so atwynne, Vnto the ton hadde the gre, When thei were bothe In her pouste, And that men myght haue sey in doute, Whether scholde of hem to other loute. \u00b6 But Diomedes was ful sicur, Hadde he Achilles leff[t] In that beker, That he scholde haue had no pouste, Ne qwik with lyff ne grace hadde be. THen come thedur ridyng Troyle, A-mong Gregeis he gan to royle, When he com, he did meruayles. Diomedes him assayles, And Troylus him assayled also, Litel loue was be-twene hem two; Thei reden to-gedur with speres so faste, That bothe were doun of hors caste; Vnto Troyle faste he &yogh;ede, Ther he sat opon his stede. \u00b6 He smot to Troyle opon his fote, But Troylus did ther-In bote, He smot his stede thorow the haunche, He myght no more afftir launche; His stede fel doun, and he him by, Thei fau&yogh;t to-geder with envy, But thei were horsed a-&yogh;eyn vp bothe; Not-for-thi thei were so wrothe, That eyther of hem to other sought, When thei were on horse broght; Many a strok was be-twene hem cast, But Diomedes atte last Troylus toke with gret violence; But many of Troye In his defence \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit Beotem & Archilogum. At that tyme ful smartly stryues In gret aventure and drede of here lyues, And delyuered Troyle out of his hand, Thei come strikand on the sond. \u00b6 To that batayle come Menelaus, Kyng Henes, and Theseus; A&yogh;eyn hem come of Troye Paris With other kynges and alle his. At that batayle died mechel folk, Eche stede stod ful, bothe plasch & polk, Of mennes blode that died there. Ful sicurly Ector lefft neuere To sclo Gregeis, and hem confounde, Thei fled fro him as hares fro the hounde. That saw an hardy newe-made kny&yogh;t Off hem of Grece, Boetes hy&yogh;t, That no man myght make Ector leue; This Boetes thoght, he wolde that reue With a spere stalworthe and towe, But [Ector] at that strok lowe And seyde to him: 'what hastow don? Wolde thow wynne on me thi schon?' He &yogh;aff no more of his smytyng Then of a fflyes bytyng, But he smot him a&yogh;eyn so sore, That fro his heued doun to his schore He cleue him doun by the chyn, As it hadde ben a lard swyn; \u00b6 He sent his stede Into his In. Archilogus was of his kyn; When he his cosyn ded saw, Him lyked noght with Ector plaw, He thoght him venge, if he moght, He drank ful ille, and that was noght; Him hadde ben better, he hadde ben than, When he Ector smyte be-gan, For him saued not his riche croun; He carf a-two bothe flesche and bon, He culpunte him h altered from b in MS. as he MS. here . were an ele, . . . . . No gap in MS. \u00b6 He smote euen In-two his myddel Ryght euen at his gerdul, That half fel doun, and half sat stille, His armes myght not do ther-tille. Hit was a wondir sight to se, When \u00fee hors be-gan to fle, A-mong the prese whan he ran, Op-on his bak with half a man. PRocenor was that kynges Cosyn; When he saw his witer-wyn Hadde him MS. by . sclawe, sore him rewed, For-sothe ther-fore his bale he brewed,\u2014 The body was ther freli kut,\u2014 And smot to Ector so ful but b altered from h in MS. ,\u2014 He rode to him euen sydilyng\u2014 Vn-til grounde he him bryng; He smot him euene vndir the cheke, That he made him the ground to seke. Off him was not Ector perceyued, He was of him wel sore disceyued; \u00b6 Opon his hors lepe tite Ector, He ouer-toke kyng Procenor, He set a strok vpon his heued, That he ete no more bred, He cleff him euene in two parties; On eyther syde his hors he lyes, As it hadde ben two clouen stikkes, Or of a swyn two clouen flikkes. Hic Ector occidit Procenorem Regem This line in red paint ought to be the head-line, cp. special note. The head-line is erased. . AChilles saw his strokes echon, In his herte made he gret mon, Procenor was of his lynage, A riche kyng of gret parage; He saw alle dye, bothe duk and kyng, That come or &yogh;ede In Ector goyng. \u00b6 Achilles seyde: 'if he lyue longe, Here is non of vs so stronge, That euere schal wynne fro him lyue MS. on lyue . ; Ther bees sat neuere so thikke on hyue, Ne corn In lond is MS. In his lond . thikker sawen, That he ne scles oure men and ouer-throwen.' \u00b6 Achilles maketh alle his men redy, And kynges to of his contrey, And seide: 'se &yogh;e MS. &yogh;e se . not, lordynges, How Ector here to dethe brynges Alle that cometh vndir his hand? I se no man MS. noman . his strok with-stand! If he laste longe In his outrage, He sclees vs alle bothe lord and page. \u00b6 But of this world if we mowe Deliuere him! but I not howe: Iff we myght be so quaynte and scly, That we vn-armed come him by. For iff he take vntil vs hede, I wot wel we schal neuere spede; Go we alle vpon a ffrusche, Opon the erthe we schal him crusche, We schal him scle and al to-colpen; But we do thus, we ben not holpen.' \u00b6 Thanne strok to Ector alle that rabel, But he &yogh;aff nou&yogh;t ther-of a babel, For he was war of hem comyng And of here malice and here thynkyng. \u00b6 Hic Achilles & alij Reges Grecorum ffugierunt. Thei smot on him, as thei were wode, But Ector euere here strokes stode, He smot of heuedes with basenettis, Ther is no bote, ther he his strok settis. \u00b6 Achilles fley with alle his ffrape, He was ffayn that he myght scape, He thoght wel longe he dwelled there, He wolde haue ben he roght neuere where. For Alle Achilles trecherie Thei wolde not sen his ffisnamye, But fled a-way to her tentis, For many of hem ther her hed of-hentis; \u00b6 For Ector euere hem schased, Helm and Coyffe he of-rased, And sclow hem bothe &yogh;onge and olde, As wolues don schep that ben In folde. Hadde thei had dayes lyght,\u2014 But sicurly it was nyght,\u2014 That non of hem myght other chese; Ne Ector wolde not his men lese, \u00b6 Affter his men he be-gan to blowe, For non of hem myght other knowe; And that fel faire for the Gregeis\u2014 What-so-euere any man seis\u2014 Thei hadde elles ben bounden In thral, Or thei scholde haue dyed al. \u00b6 For witnes beres her-off Dares, And Tites also with-oute les, On ayther syde were thei heraudes, In wham my&yogh;t be no fraudes; Thei were ther bothe euen & mo[r]ne. Dares was of Troye borne, Kyng Troyen and kyng Frigais, Tites of Grece, and kyng Danais; Thei were with hem euere In the feld, Whan thei stode and whan thei fled. So saith the noble Clerk Cuydo, He fond her bokes bothe two With-oute lesyng or variaunce In siker proses and no romaunce, And he translated wel and fyne Bothe her bokes In-to Latyne, Bothe of Gru and Troye langage; Heuene be his heritage! HIt was nyght, the sterres gan schyne, The Gregeis made gret dele and dyne For her ffrendes that were sclayn, And was be-reued blode and brayn; For her frendes that died that day Ther was cry and weylawey. Thei swore by god In firmament: 'If Ector lyue, we are alle y-schent; Schal non of vs a&yogh;eyn him pas, Kyng ne kny&yogh;t, more ne las. Waried worth hem vs hedir broght! For here we lese, and wynne noght; &YOGH;it schal we lese and drye more Oure lyues alle by goddis ore.' \u00b6 Agame[n]on herde that playnt, He saw his men were alle ataynt, For her frendes thei made care, Thei seyde: \"thei scholde alle to deth fare\"; Thei cried and seyde euerychone: \"That he him-self sclow mo alone Than alle that other of his parti\";\u2014 'Who may with-stonde suche An enemy MS. Anenemy . ? \u00b6 It was neuere man &yogh;aff MS. thaff . suche strokes; Off a man were mad of okes, Off Marbil gray and grete stones, And yren and stele were alle his bones, He wolde hem al to-cleue MS. alto cleue . \u2014 By him that made Adam and Eue!' \u00b6 Agamenon with care was cold, He wiste neuere, how Gregeis to hold, That thei a-&yogh;eyn to Grece ne ferde; Whan he that playnt a-monges hem herde, In his herte he then kest, To sle Ector, how myght he best. A-non he sende his sonde To alle the kynges vpon that stronde, As thei loued here lyues dere, And prayed him in alle manere, That thei wolde come for his loue alle With-oute dwellyng In-to his halle. \u00b6 These lordes qwyk with-oute dwellyng Come to him In that euenyng, Thei come to his pauyloun, Duk, prince and kynges with croun; Thei set hem doun vpon the des, Thei hoped wel with-oute les, Whi that thei were afftir send; Hit was for-sothe right, as thei wend. AGamenon seide: 'lordyngis, This man Ector to schame vs brynges, Ther is of him gret noyse and cry, &YOGH;e here it wel, and so do I; Iff he lyue longe and goth forth thus, He wol scle oure men and alle vs, He schal not leue with-Inne two &yogh;ere Off vs lyuande that now is here; &YOGH;e se wel alle, how he fares, He chases vs as hound doth hares; \u00b6 Hic Greci tenuerunt consilium ad occidendum Ectorem. How hath he smetyn thes kynges and schorne! But he be ded, we ben alle lorne, Off we be fele, and thei ffewe; We schal neuere no maystrye schewe Off hem of Troye, ne Troye wynne, The while that he this world is Inne. \u00b6 Him-selff alone hem alle saues, Kyng and kny&yogh;t, sqwyeres and knaues, And he vs alle him ones greues. By him that In oure god leues! But we scle him with som quayntise, We schal neuere In other wyse Off hem of Troye oure Iornay spede, But we myght qwyte him his mede!' NOw are these kynges In a-visement, And eche man seith his Iugement, Many a resoun is ther y-schewed, Bothe of lered and of lewed; Eche man telles his reson Afftir his beste discrecion. Now sitte thei alle, and taken here rede, Now the Emperour vnto hem sede: \u00b6 'Alas, that &yogh;e were mad kny&yogh;tes! &YOGH;e scholde sitte and wake nyghtes, As hauke on perche that sittes in mewe; A kny&yogh;tes deth &yogh;e can rewe. Now are the kny&yogh;tes hardi and strong, And euery day he is &yogh;ow among; Whi ne scle &yogh;e him, and make him die With som tresoun and ffelonye?' \u00b6 A Ector, thin ere au&yogh;t to glowe, For thow hast now fou&yogh;ten y-nowe; Wold god, Ector, hit were the sayd How thei haue thi deth purvayd! Thow scholde be saffe at devys, Iff that thow wolde be war and wys And kepe the fro alle her gyn, Thow woldest be war to come ther-In. \u00b6 Thes lordes ben alle In gret stody, Some are pale, and some rody, And some sittes in a dwale, For pure angur thei wax al pale; Alle haue at Ector dispyte, That he were ded with-oute refyte. \u00b6 Thei prayed Achilles for her sake: \"That he wolde that charge take, For ther was non so wele couthe In al the world by northe ne southe, Ne non that myght stonde strokes thre In al this world of him but he;\" \u00b6 'For-thi we pray the with herte large, On the thow woldest take that charge, And the owe best this nedis to do; For if he leue and come the to And dele with at his layser, Ther saues the nother kyng ne kayser, That thow ne schalt thy lyff for-go, For he the hatis and thenkes slo. \u00b6 Fro him ful wel war the ought, Opon thi strengthe truste thow nought, But on thi wit and on thi scleyght, And holde the euere fro him on heyght; Whan thow him sees in a myscheef, Than schaltow him dedly greef By thi strengthe and thi wit; So schal we of him be qwit, And alle these other schal we kylle, Scle and take at oure wille.' And thus haue thei her consayl ent, And eche man is hamward went, To ete and drynke and take her rest, And to sclepe, whan hem likes best. HIt is now day, thei haue sclepen, The Troyens risen & tok her wepen, Her armes al byfore hem fecched, Some ben gode, and som ben wrecched, For many an hole and many a clyfft The day be-fore on hem was lefft; And dede on helm and basenettes, Plates and mayle with gode horetes, Mayle of bras, and goode colers MS. coters . , Aketones and genuleres; Thei ordeyned hem and made hem graythe, And thret Gregeis with wordes laythe. \u00b6 Now the sonne is vp rysen, Thei brought forth bothe Mule and Fryson, Hoby, stede, and gode rounsi; Thei alle ben goynge and alle redi Toward the Gregeis with-oute the &yogh;ates, For thei wolde haue the fight al-gates. \u00b6 Ector was be-fore al-weyes, He belan neuere to scle the Gregeis, He cleues hem, and thorow strikes, And throwes hem In clyf and dikes, He makes here hedes naked and bare, The bodyes cleue In-to the schare, He drow here scheldes fro here nekkes, Ther aketons ferd as toren sekkes; Off his scheld made he present To alle that wolde &yogh;eue strok or hent; His sword was wel with alle a-kuoynt MS. a knoynt . With kyng, and duke, and prince anoynt; Hic Greci et Troiani ffecerunt magnum bellum. Men were alle ferd of his lokyng. Men wolde seye \"hit were lesyng,\" Iff that a man the sothe sayde, What men that day to grounde layde. \u00b6 Achilles holdes him euere asyde, He maketh him redi to wayte his tyde; As ffische is dreven to the bayte, So waytes he him at som defaute; T[h]er-vpon he euere duelles, For he atentis to no-thyng elles, For whan he may his tyme se Opon Ector venged to be. PAris come with hem of Perse, With many a baner diuerse, With bowys gode wel y-strenged; A-mong Gregeis whan thei were menged, Thei schotte many thorow bak and brest, That neuere spak afftir with prest. \u00b6 Agamenon on syde houed, With gode Armes and wel y-gloued; He saw Paris was thedur y-comen, That fro his brother his wiff hadde y-nomen; He was to him wel greuous, For he hadde wedded his brother spous, Him were leuer than alle Lorynge, That he myght his brother venge; \u00b6 He come to him ful wel batayled, And with his ost Paris assayled. Ector saw that Emperour Was comen doun In-to that stour, He lefft alle other and rod to him, And &yogh;aff him certes woundes grym, He smot him thorow his gode hauberk, Thorow his scheld and his serke, In-to the body and threwe him ouer; Hit was gret wonder he myght couer. \u00b6 But Achilles was In a-gayt, He come anon bothe stout and st[r]ayt, With many a lord and many a kny&yogh;t, When he saw him In suche a ply&yogh;t. Ector was his men with-oute, Achilles closed him al aboute, That non of his scholde to him come; But he &yogh;aff not ther-of a throme, He layde opon hem dyntes grete, That sicurly thei made him swete; Thei were many and held him hote, Wherfore he ran al on swote. \u00b6 Then come Troyle and Eueas With [sword] & scheld and gode anlas, Dryuand doun to helpe Ector; Achilles was wel wroth ther-for. \u00b6 When Diomedes saw Eueas, A stalworthe spere to him he tas, Wel ney his flanke his strok he tecles, And strikes him with spere and pricles, And he ran forth as foule that flyes. But Eueas be war, he abyes The bolde wordes that dede sclyng, 'When that thow sittes by the kyng'; For he reuyled him so vylenslye,\u2014 He thoght right wel, he scholde abye,\u2014 When he was sent In message; But he be war, he getis his wage. So soffte sailes nother schip ne bote, As he rod thedur and to him smote; He &yogh;aff Eueas a grisly wounde, And bare him doun to the grounde; Out of his sadel he him sclong Vilonsly among the throng, \u00b6 And seide vnto him his gole: 'Welcome be thow hedir to me! Thow art the kynges conseler Last e altered from a in MS. ; Iff I may mete the efft her, And thow this batayle efft haunte, I schal the teche for to chaunte, I schal the teche bothe burdoun and mene, Ne be thow neuere so wroth ne wrene!' AChilles fau&yogh;t with Ector &yogh;et With-oute wordes & with-oute flit, Ther were dou&yogh;ti dyntes deled With al the myght that thei weled, Ayther of hem on other layd; Ther men my&yogh;t se wel hard brayd Be-twene two kny&yogh;tes of hardi mode, Thei fau&yogh;t to-gedur as thei were wode; Strongur was neuere be-twene two kny&yogh;tes. Ector sore Achilles dightes, Opon his helme is many a score, Many an hole, and many a bore; So ney the deth Ector him dryues, That his vertu fast vnthryues, For sorily hadde he him dight; Ther my&yogh;t men se bothe her myght. \u00b6 Ector was for-fou&yogh;ten al day, And he dede not but wayted him ay, To stele on him as a theff, When he fond him at myscheff. He wende then haue don him of dawe And his lymes al to-drawe MS. alto drawe . , But for al his quaynt thoght He was almost brought to nought; \u00b6 Adhuc Bellum. His myght was al-most y-don, Nadde him come help son, Ector hadde y-taken him elles; In many a stid his blod out quelles. \u00b6 Him to helpe come Theseus kyng, A strong kny&yogh;t In alle thyng Als come thedur pricande sone; He swore by him that sat in throne: \"That him were leuere be al quyk fflayn, Then Achilles were take or sclayn.\" \u00b6 Diomedes saw also, That Achilles my&yogh;t not do; Ector was on him so hidous, So ful of wrathe and greuous, That he was dryuen so ney the prikke, That he myght not his lippis likke. \u00b6 Thes kynges thanne to Ector goth, And swor his deth, as thei were wroth, And layd on bothe halues tho, And &yogh;aff him strokes y-nowe & mo. But Theseus son to him lepe, As kny&yogh;t that was good and &yogh;epe, And &yogh;aff Ector a stroke vnride, That the blod be-gan out glide; The strok was huge and gret, Men myght ther-with haue sclayn a net; The strok was smetyn with gret folye, He barst of his mayle thre & thrittye, \u00b6 He barst of hem mo than an hundur, And persed his Armure, that hit was vndur; Al he to-rent his armure, That it come to his fflesche pure; Afftir the strok the blode out sprong, He hadde a strok a schafftmon long. But Ector &yogh;aff ther-of but lytel: Diomedes he &yogh;aff a titel, And with his swerd a comyssioun, That of his stede he fel a-doun, That men my&yogh;t se his yren breche; He &yogh;aff not of hem a leke. \u00b6 Then come theder Menelaus, Vlixes kyng, and Theseus, The du&yogh;ti kyng Palamydes, Ermules, and Polymetes, Neoptolomus, and kyng Schelene, The noble dou&yogh;ti duk Menescene, Duk Nestor, and kyng Thoas, With alle his men Philocoas; \u00b6 The kynges alle with here Meyne Come doun alle to that semble, With kny&yogh;tes, squier, Erle and swayn, Was non be-hynde\u2014soth to sayn;\u2014 That were tho that strong be-sted, The blod was mochel that ther was bled. THe Troiens saw hem come doun alle, Opon her men then gon thei falle, Than seyde the Troyens: 'go we echon, Go we to hem, go we gon! We schal of hem to grounde warpe MS. wrape . With swordes bryght and speres scharpe.' Than was ther a woful metyng: Many a wyff made thei wepyng, Many a gaylard kny&yogh;t and gay\u2014 When thei were met\u2014dyed that day. \u00b6 I Trowe, sythen men couthe wepyn bere, And hors bere sadel and other gere, Herde neuere man telle In boke ne rede So manye at ones lye dede, At on Iornay lye and deye. Some were smeten thorow the eye, Some to the brayn vn-to the crawe, Some In-to the body, and some In-to the mawe, Some the schuldres, & som the mylte, Off bothe the parties were many on spilte. Eche man on other schetis, As thikke as heryng fletis; \u00b6 Many a legge lay on that sond, Many on loste bothe arme & hond, Many an hed was smeten of thore; Thei cried and &yogh;elled as boles rore, Men myght here the cry a myle Off hem that dyed ther that while. The brethe thei blew stode lyke a smoke, Hit ros ouer hem as the roke MS. reke . , Hit ferd a-boute hem as a myst. Many man to grounde ther dist With mouthe and nase, al her vnthonkes; Ector hewes of legges and schankes, Many a man doth he to dethe, He seses neuere, whil he hath brethe. Off alle the men that euere god wroght I haue most meruayle In my thoght Off Ector certis and of his dedes, And so haue alle that of him redes: Ther dar non stonde of him a box, Thei fle fro him, as hen doth fro the fox. \u00b6 I trowe, god made neuere suche a kny&yogh;t, Ne &yogh;af neuere man suche a my&yogh;t, That euere was borne In toun or port, But it were only to Sampsoun fort, For he [was] seker with-oute pere Off alle the men that euere were. Off Sampson hadde ben ther that tyde And al that day hadde reden him be-syde, He ne my&yogh;t haue don no more then he For al his my&yogh;t and his pouste. Red I neuere of kny&yogh;t ne man, That born was of womman In the margin, by another hand, much faded, very indistinct: ' Driuyng hour (?) I pray the to . . . my well ordered .' , That dede the dedis that Ector did; Alas, that euere him mys-be-tid! AGamenon and kyng Pandale Thei rode to-gedur in that dale, Ayther of hem made other tumble Bothe on fyngur & on thumbe. Menelaus saw Paris; Off him wold he not mys; His spere was strong, the hed wel steled, He smot Paris, that he doun reled Ouer & ouer, as were a snayl; He bare him ouer his hors tayl. \u00b6 Paris ther-of gret schame thoght, That he to grounde so sone was broght; He ros vp ful pale and wan. For schame he hadde of fair Eleyn, He was ther-of wel sore aschamed, That he of Eleyne schulde be blamed, That sche saw so foule a falle, Ther sche was set In castel walle. \u00b6 Vlixes rod to kyng Arastre, Thei fau&yogh;t to-gedur In that plastre, Strong batayle was be-twix hem two, But atte laste be-tyd hem so, That kyng Arastre so sore was priked, That his eres the grounde likked; \u00b6 Vlixes toke the stede by the rest, And sende him hom, he dede the best. \u00b6 Polidomes and kyng Hupoun Eyther of hem barst other vpon, That bothe here speris MS. stedis . barst, That kyng Hupoun was ded doun cast; Afftir that strok his tonge neuere wawed, Hit was with him wel euel dawed. Hupoun was a man of elde, Palamydes that strok be-held, He saw the kyng ligge & dye Right ther be-fore his eye. SAyd the kyng Palamydes: 'Thow schalt abye, Palidomes!' He strok him so sore sidlynge, That of his hors fel that kynge, As it were a clewe of thred; Ne ete he neuere afftir bred. Now lyest thow ther on thi syde, The deuel made the a stede be-stride, For litel myght is In thi lymes. Palamydes Hupoun vp nymes, And sent him to his Pauyloun With mychel lamentac[i]oun. \u00b6 Afftir that Neoptolomus Rod to kyng Archilogus, Ayther &yogh;aff other suche a kayl, That thei fflowen ouer the hors tayl Opon that playn, as it were two rattes, Thei lay ston-stille as two cattes. \u00b6 Carras rod to kyng Schelene MS. schenele . , Him hadde be beter at home to bene, For Schelene &yogh;aff him suche a balle, That of his stede he made him falle, He &yogh;aff him suche a benedicite, That he fel dede opon the ble. \u00b6 Afftir that kyng Philomene Fel to ride to kyng Mescene, But Mescene rod ouer his cropere And lefft his stede, that was him dere; Philomene sende him vnto hise, For he him [wan] with valyauntise. \u00b6 Philocoas and kyng Remus Rod to-gedur wel irus, That to the grounde rode bothe kynges, As euen as thei were drawen with strenges. CAriolus, a kyng corouned, And Theseus kyng to-geder routed With speres scharpe, that men my&yogh;t here; When thei to-geder met In-fere, Here speres brast al In-sunder, As it were a blast of thonder; The strokes were strong, here bakkes bent, Ne hadde the speres a-sonder went, Thei schuld haue dyed at my wenyng Bothe to-geder at that metyng. Here mayles barst, her aketons rofe, The yren In-to the fflesch drofe, The blod gerd out, as were a gote, Thei tombled ouer bothe hed and throte; Thei lay ston-stille In that plot, As it hadde ben an erthe-clot. \u00b6 Ector bretheren were mechel to prayse, Many a doughti man thei reyse Out of here sadles and bere hem bak, And lefft hem ligge as a sak With grisly wounde and al ded leffte, That thei come neuere to batayle effte. \u00b6 The doughti kyng sir Thelamon Saw ther a kyng,\u2014het sir Padon,\u2014 To him he wolde [faste] ride, He smot his hors and made him glide Ouer forow and ouer falow As swyff[t] as any swalow, Til he him met atte speres ende; Sir Pedoun a-&yogh;eyn him gan wende: 'Thow semest,'\u2014he sayde,\u2014'no lyuande creature, In my god I the coniure! And if thow be the deuel Sathanas, I schal the mete In this plas.' Thei riden to-gedur with-oute fayle, That thei fel doun top ouer tayle; Thei mette so wel, that nother fayled, That the blod fro hem rayled; Thei fel doun vpon the grene, That men wende ded thei hadde bene. ABoute Ector euere thei rayled; The Gregeis euel he assayled, He hewys hem offte alle to grotes, He falles hem thikker, than the motes In somer-tide fflyen In the sonne, He spares nother qwik ne donne, Lord ne lady, riche ne pore, Strong ne feble, stiff ne store. \u00b6 Achilles clepes to him Thoas, A dou&yogh;ti kyng,\u2014his cosyn was,\u2014 He sayde: 'Cosyn, I haue meruayle, We are not worth a scnayle A-&yogh;eyn that man, that &yogh;onde fyghtes Vndir vs alle with myght & scleghtes; He sles oure men by fyue and six, He countes hem as thei were a kex; He weries not, ne belynnes nere, But lastes euere In his wode gere, Ryght as it were enchauntement; Many a kny&yogh;t hath he schent. Go we to him on a closter, Oure myght on him let vs now muster! For now I hope and wot right wele, His myght be passed som dele; I trowe now wel, he be myghtles, Or oure godis be not rightwes, And he of my&yogh;t is more than thay. Go we and loke, what we do may! And so schal we on him be wroken!' When Achilles hadde thus spoken, THese kynges two with-oute abode As-tide thei to Ector rode, And layde on him as lyther hynes MS. lytherhynes , but the down-stroke of the second h is crossed. Many a strok the two cosynes, Achilles and kyng Thoas; Thei roffe his helme In that cas, That hadde ben made of tre or lether, Hit greued not him of a feder; Thei brast his helme In many a stede, And made his blode aboute him sprede. \u00b6 Thei did bothe certis ther myght, To him sle or take In that fyght With many a knyght bothe fat & megre. But kyng Toas was on him egre, Off Ector heued his helme he drow; But Ector &yogh;aff him strokes y-now, With tene smot he that lorer, That he brast helme and his viser, And halff his nase he did of-kerue, Off suche a seruice he did him serue; Thoas fel to grounde thore, For he was wounded swythe sore. ECtor brether come then alle, Thei saw Thoas by Ector falle, Thei ride to him and alle that other And help right wel Ector, her brother; Thei fau&yogh;t with Gregeis meru[el]ously And bare hem doun dispitously; \u00b6 Achilles wolde no lengur abyde. Thei toke Thoas In al his pride And ladde him to Troie to here prisoun, Thei caste him In a depe dongoun, Thei thrat him alle, tho he was tan, For ther brother Cassibalan, That he hadde sclayn with glad spede, Thei him be-hight In alle mede. \u00b6 Antenor and Dephebus Lad him to Troye ful greuous Of his woundes and his takyng, And also of his presonyng; Thei lefft him ther In sicur warde, And went a&yogh;eyn to her standarde. \u00b6 Kyng Thelaman at that rescous Was born to grounde as a mous, The bretheren him threw to grounde tho, For he assayled Ector also With kyng Thoas and Achilles; Him hadde ben better haue ben in pes, For suche a wounde thei him be-tau&yogh;t, That he leffte bothe mayn and mau&yogh;t. Thei bare him to his Pauyloun, Til he come ther In a ded swoun. Menelaus kest al his wit, How he my&yogh;t Paris best hit; \u00b6 Paris saw wel his waytyng, He was war of his laykyng, Off his euel wil was Paris war; His bowe he bente al redi thar, He set ther-In a kene beket And to Menelaus he hit schet; That hed was mad with foule venym. Paris wel euene schot at him, And he fel doun, as he scholde dye, The blod ran out of his eye. \u00b6 Paris at him euel taysed; Fro the grounde his men him raysed, And bare him home to his hale, And laide him doun In-myddes the sale. To him come sithen surgiens And other noble ficisiens; His wounde ful wisly then he soghte, When thei were to him broghte. \u00b6 Thei &yogh;af him drynke & gode medecynes, And slaked him then of his pynes, Thei schof aboute wel soffte his flesche, With good wateres thei him weche, Thei greythed him gode oynement. When he was dyght, his stede he hent, And rod a&yogh;eyn to that stour, And sought Paris with semblant sour; \u00b6 He swor by goddis dyng[ne]te, He schuld on him wel venged be. When Paris hadde with him thus toyled, Off his Armes he him dispoyled, He cast of al his armure, And fau&yogh;t with him In cors pure, With bowe and arwe fedred with po, He wroght amonges hem mechel wo. \u00b6 Menelaus was wel war, That Paris thenne non armes bar, But was al naked In his clothes; He swor his dethe with gret othes, A stalworth spere to him he kipped With stelen hed that wel was tipped. I hope wel Paris ded hadde ben, Ne hadde Eueas gon be-twen, That he myght not Paris come to, For no-thyng that thei my&yogh;t do. \u00b6 Eueas thanne hath led hom Paris With mochel folk to Troye y-wis, That Menelaus met him not with, For he nas y-armed nother lym ne lyth. ECtor saw al that fare, How he was lad to Troye al bare. To Menelaus &yogh;aff he tent, To scle his brother how he hadde ment; Ector therfore was sore greued, Ther-fore his helme In-two he cleued, Thorow his coyfe his gode swerd bot; Menelaus ther-fore not flote, Ne hadde no wordes him to speke, Ne hadde no my&yogh;t him-self to wreke. \u00b6 Ector wolde haue taken him fayn, He put ther-to my&yogh;t and mayn; But ther come many a moder barne, Duk and kyng,\u2014I the warne,\u2014 With alle her kny&yogh;tes, him to rescowe, For he lay stille as a sowe; Ther come mo knyghtes to his defence Than ben now In alle Tarence. \u00b6 On Ector alle thei gan leye, Many a body he did ther dye, Many a man to dethe gos, For thei lette him of his purpos; \u00b6 Hic Greci ffugerunt. He sclees hem & falles that he reches, Delful strokes he hem be-teches, He maymed hem and ouer-al slees, That he hadde neuere more pees, Many a man he ther spilles; The Gregeys ffleis ouer dales & hilles, As faste as thei may ride, Toward her tentis on eche a side. ECtor affter euere chases, At eche a lepe his stede vnbrasis, Thei fledde him as hare doth hound; Men my&yogh;t haue filled a gret dromound With bodijs that he sclow chasand, And euere he folowed manassand. He swar here deth by bok and belle, He nolde neuere sese hem to qwelle; Scholde neuere man ne creature Haue went fro MS. for . that batel sure, \u00b6 Hadde thei of Troye had day-lyght,\u2014 So were thei ferd and discomfyght;\u2014 But sterres ros vpon the sky, Ector lefft his chase for-thi And turned hem to his Cite, With kyng, duk, and his meyne; And did sone off hem her harneys & set hem doun on benche & deys This line written in the margin very neatly, but by the same hand.\u2014The last line of this MS. page (not printed here) is repeated there on the back of the leaf as first line. , And made her bones nesche and souple, For ther was many a worthi couple, For gret trauayle that thei hadde had Off thaire restyng were thei glad. NOw is Ector comen to halle, And the stedis stabeled alle, Thei ar vndight and set In stable; Then was reysed many a table, The bordes were layd, the clothes spred This line is in the MS. a repetition of the last line of the preceding page, where only leyd is written instead of layd . See footnote 2 on preceding page. , And thei are set and richely fed With mete and drynke, gret plente, With vernage, Cret, and clarre, With other drynkes and riche metes. \u00b6 But Priamus no-thyng for-&yogh;etes To make thaire &yogh;ates fast\u2014 He was of the Gregeis so sore agast,\u2014 With many bare and many a croke, And men y-nowe the &yogh;ates to loke, That alle men that were trauayled Schulde, when Gregeis hem assayled With noyse or cry or any affray, In thaire bed [be] ther thei lay. \u00b6 The &yogh;ates he keped, and thei ben sere To ete and drynke and make gode chere, To ete & drynke can thei not sese, Thei were serued with many a messe, With many noble diuers rost, With mete bakyn, sothen, and tost. THe clothes were drawen, when \u00feei had eten; Kyng and duk and alle that ther seten, Layd MS. layd . be-side hem bothe gerdel and pouche, And wente than alle to thaire couche, And held hem vnder couertoure, And sclepte wel a gode mesure,\u2014 Til nyght was gon, and sonne schon wyde, That men my&yogh;t se on eche a syde. \u00b6 With mechel noyse thei hem atyred, Thei hadde long sclept and were en-yred, And as thei her armure held In hande, Kyng Priamus sente his tithande, That thei schulde be that day In pees And make hem alle wele at es. \u00b6 Priamus sende his messageres, And afftir his priue counseleres, To kyng and duk and to Ector, And afftir Troyle and Antenor, Til Dephebus and Eueas, Paris and Polamydes, That thei scholde come to his Paleis, To here his consayl ther alweis. \u00b6 Thei spedde hem faste euerychon: Thedir is comen kyng Monnon, Gode Ector, and many another, Troylus, and Dephebus his brother, To Priamus that were priue, What he wolde, to here and se. When thei were y-comen alle To Ylion In-to the halle, Thei sat hem doun on that days, Thei were stille and held her pays; Saue Priamus, that kyng corouned, Was non of hem that o word souned. HE spak to hem with glad chere And seyde: 'lordynges, &yogh;e are me dere; With-oute &yogh;oure wil and &yogh;oure assent Wol I not do, so haue I ment. I schal &yogh;ow telle myn herte wille, What is my resoun and my skylle, Whi I haue sent afftir &yogh;ow; Sittes stille and herkenes now! \u00b6 Me thinketh oure goddis speciale And haue vs &yogh;euen gret riale, For vs haue thei mechel wrought; To honour hem ful wel we ought. Thei loue vs wel specially, And worchin for vs rially, Ther-fore schal we on alle wyse Do to oure goddis sacrifise With riche offerand and gret dispense, And hem worschepe and do reuerence. \u00b6 We mot nede hem glorifye, That hath vs sent oure enemye And schamely lyght In oure prisoun, That vs hath don gret tresoun With force and armes and cruelte, That wolde sle bothe &yogh;ow and me, To robbe oure goddis, and oure Cite brenne, And oure wyues ledde henne, And make oure childer thral and cherles, That schulde be kynges, dukes, and Erles; And we hem ones greued, By alle the gode non ther leued! \u00b6 Me thinketh by resoun, and &yogh;ow thynk als, That this freke and traytour fals Be &yogh;oure consayl and Iugement With-oute the toun be ybrent, Or fle him quyk al by the lawe, Or with wilde hors him to-drawe, Or elles hong him on galowe-tre, That wolde distroye &yogh;oure Cite; And so schal alle these other drede. What sey &yogh;e now, what &yogh;e rede? \u00b6 Lete se now, what dethe demes, Wheche deth of thes him best semes? Schal he be qwartered MS. qwarteler . with a knyff? To se him ded, were al my lyff!' Ther was no kyng that croune bered, That Priamus that tyme answered With word, whan he was demand; But sat stille as dere on the land, But were of that strong stonayd, Of hem alle no word thei sayd. Eueas was wis, witti, and lered, To speke than was he not fered, He saw the kyng hadde wratthe I-tane For the dethe of Cassibalane, The kynges sone, he loued best; For wratthe him thoght his herte brast. \u00b6 By-fore the kyng Eueas stode, And spak to him with milde mode, And sayde to him as the wyse: 'Nolde god, that any of thise Schamful dethe that to him deme! Hit is wel better that &yogh;e him &yogh;eme Hole and sound In gode sauete, For we wot neuere,\u2014no more wot &yogh;e,\u2014 What may be-falle som tyme to &yogh;oure, How it wol schape to vs and oure. \u00b6 The doughtiest man that euere was born May falle, be tan, or elles lorn Among his fos be chaunce and happe. God made neuere so dou&yogh;ti a schappe, That was so michel of strengthe & myght, Geaunt, champioun, ne other knyght, He mot be take In batayle; Al day we sene it, no meruayle! \u00b6 Ther-fore, sire, I do not rede That &yogh;e do thus Thoas to dede, For &yogh;e wot wel, my lord the kyng, That kyng Toas and his ospryng Is comen of alle the beste lynage Off hem of Grece that ben of age; Alle the gret blod of Grece Ben some his Emes, and some his nece, Alle of his kyn, and to him longe, Ther is non gretter hem amonge. So thei wolde do to oure frende, Iff any come In here bende, And &yogh;iff vs the same Iugement, The beste of vs if thei mowe hent; Off som of oure hit myght be-tyde, &YOGH;e wold not for al the world wyde Se him haue suche a chaunce For al \u00fee lond of Spayne & Fraunce This line inserted in the margin, like l. 7024. . \u00b6 I rede therfore, kyng Thoas saue; The same a-&yogh;eyn &yogh;e mowe it haue, &YOGH;e may &yogh;it kyng Thoas chaunge For on of oure or for som strange. Ther-fore, lord, if I durst it say, I wolde &yogh;ow rede and also pray, That &yogh;e wolde kepe kyng Thoas wele; Hit may be-quyt &yogh;ow euery dele. \u00b6 Gode Ector, assente ther-to And rede thi fader, to do right so!' He radde his ffader \"that consail holde That Eueas hadde ther tolde\";\u2014 'I holde his consail gode and trewe. Iff &yogh;e him scle, hit may &yogh;ow rewe; For if any of &yogh;oure be y-take, We may him chaunge and so pees make.' PRiamus held him not payde, That Ector thus to him sayde; In his entent &yogh;et he leffte And sayde to Ector wrothely effte: 'And if we do with Thoas thus,\u2014 What schal oure enemys saye of vs, That we haue of hem suche awe, That we dar not do the lawe? . . . . . No gap in MS. And therto amonges hem be wel ffawe The last word, ffawe , on erasure. ; Thei schal drede vs the lesse And holde vs ferd and hertlesse. But not-for-thi! a-&yogh;eyn my wille, I schal assente &yogh;oure consail tille.\" And so was Thoas saued fro ded Thorow gode Ector and Eueas red. And Eueas &yogh;ede to Eleyne, to se That curtays quene of gret bewte. Kyng Thoas herte be-gan to qwake, He wende to be hanged al nake; But Ector wolde he were saued. Priamus wolde that Troye hadde be paued With hethen hond and euery a membre; That he hadde bended or Septembre, If he my&yogh;t haue had his wille; But Ector wold not lete him spille, And thus hadde thei that conseil ent. The nyght is comen, the day is went, \u00b6 Euery man to his In owe, The wayte be-gan nyght to blowe. Mone ne sterre saw man non, The cloudes haue hem ouer-gon; It wex al dym with derk cloude, The wynde be-gan to blowe loude, The wynd turned In-to the west, Hit made a wonder gret tempest. Among Gregeis blew many a blast And alle ther tentis to grounde cast; So wonderly the wynd it blewe, That alle here tentis ouer-threwe; Al &yogh;ede to grounde bothe tent and hale, Here ropes vayled not of a schale. Wo is hem In here MS. hem . sclepes, The wynd brast bothe tre and ropes, Ther was no stake that fast held, Nother of Pauyloun ne of teld. Hit was as derk as helle, Might no man se\u2014the sothe to telle,\u2014 To set a-&yogh;eyn teld ne tent; Thei were almost with wedir schent. \u00b6 It be-gan dredly to thunder; Thei hadde nou&yogh;t to hele hem vnder. Hit blew, it rayned, and eke snewe, Thei turned for cold bothe hide & hewe; It thundred loude, it ffres, hit hayled, Michel wo that nyght hem ayled; It lygthned vp In the firmament, As al the world hadde y-brent; Hem thought, the sky had y-brend al opon, In-to the erthe thei wolde haue cropon For sorwe, and wo, and gret turmentes That thei hadde of the elementes. Affter that be-gan it rayne, As al the world scholde be sclayne; As water rennes In a goute, The sky gan falle hem aboute. Vp In the sky thei it hadde lade, Men myght with-Inne a wyle wade A-mong the hors vp to the hamme, Than lefte no man synge his gamme; \u00b6 Thei were a-ferd of Noye flode Hadde comen a-&yogh;eyn, thei vndirstode. Al was fir in the firmament, As it scholde the world haue brent; The stedes starte out of here stalle And ran aboute faste with-alle, Men wende, that thei hadden ben wode; The sky was as red as any blode. Hem selff to helpe thai ne my&yogh;t, I-wis thei hadde a vile ny&yogh;t; It my&yogh;t haue ben no worse wedur, Off heuene & erthe hadde gon to-gedur. \u00b6 Thei banned & cursed alle tho, That made thedur hem for to go Fro thayre gode and fro ther wiff, To lede ther so karful lyff. Lord, the sorwe that hem was with! That ny&yogh;t hadde thei non other grith, Thei quok for cold, thei were al wete, Thei longed sore afftir hete. IN sorwe and wo the Gregeis are, For drede of dethe thei droupe & dare; That thei come ther ful ofte thei playn, Thei hopeth ful wel to be a-tayn To neuere se thing that thei owe, Wiff ne child, moder ne mowe. Thei sorwe thus, til hit be day; \"And her ffrendes\"\u2014 thei seyde ay\u2014 \"That lay ther dede, and som were roten, Some smetyn, & some were schoten;\"\u2014 \u00b6 'Alas!' thei seyde, 'this foul vnwit, We were with sorwe so combred and knyt! Whan that we passed the Grekysche see, We knewe ful lytel Ector poustee; Hadde we knowen,\u2014as we do now,\u2014 Than hadde we wrought afftir oure prow, And saued vs, and we dispende; For now may vs no man amende, Thes wederes done vs mechel tene. What wonder is, of we vs mene? We leue oure lord and oure frende, And we ligge here in stormes and schende; Er we wende hen, we schal be sclayn; Litel wondir is, of we vs playn.

Schulde neuere kyng ne Emperour, Duke ne kny&yogh;t, ne vauesour, Haue made vs passe the salte strem For alle the gode of Ierusalem!' Thei made gret del and playnyng; But it be-gan to leue raynyng, \u00b6 The wynd sesid the gret blast, The snewyng then no lenger last, The tempest then be-gan to sese, The thonder slaked & held her pese. Thei were glad of the sesed tempest, Thei were ful glad to cacche rest. \u00b6 The ny&yogh;t is gon, the cloudes with-drawe, The day be-gan for to dawe, The sonne schon, the wedir cleres; The Troyens then with brode baneres \u00b6 Were redi armed In the feld, On stedes stronge, with spere and scheld; The &yogh;ates were open, and thei rod out. The Gregeis of hem hadde gret dout, But not-for-thi thei hadde no nede, Thei armed hem with mechel spede, And made hem redi to the fight\u2014 With alle her power and here myght\u2014 \u00b6 A-&yogh;eyn Ector, that thei drede sore, With alle here men bothe lasse and more Here strengthe to kythe, her my&yogh;t to proue Off hem of Troye that thei saw houe In-myddes the feld, and hem abode. When bothe parties to-gedur rode, \u00b6 Hic Rex Hupon Troianus mortuus est. Delful dyntes thei deled and dalt; Many in his armes swalt, Er euen come and day was gon. Suche batayle was ther neuere non Betwene two kynges on lande ne se, Neuere was, ne neuere schal be. BOthe parties ben y-dyght, With scheld and spere and brynes bry&yogh;t, In playn feld on gode aray; Ther is no speche of no loue-day, For eche man wol on other be wreke,\u2014 What bote is than of loue to speke? Achilles with his Murmindones Passed ouer dales and dounes; He rides ouer dounes and dales With alle his men out of his hales, With baneres brode and many a sygne, With many a worthi kny&yogh;t and digne. \u00b6 The furst batayle sir Achilles To lede that day for-sothe ches; Out of his tent he is now yssed, To kyng Hupoun was he wel wyssed, A dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t of gret a-fere; But him thoght euel that he come there: Hupoun was michel and long, Hey and brod, mechel & strong, He was mechel as a geaunt; But him hadde ben better to haue ben at Gaunt Or haue leyn seke in his bed, Then he that day batayle hadde led. \u00b6 Achilles smot him with a spere, That al his Armes gan to-tere, He smot him thorow bothe flesch & bone And thorow his armes euerychone; Thoow he were mechel and long, Out of his sadel he him sclong. \u00b6 To Ector rod kyng Octomene With hate and moche tene, He come to Ector faste fleande With a stalworthe spere In hande, He smot Ector, that his spere barst. 'The deuel the honge hard and fast!' Seide Ector, 'what eyles the? Whi hastow thus smetyn me?' \u00b6 Ector was with him ful wrothe, He drow his swerd and to him gothe, And smytes him on a-nother manere; Of his scheld a ful quartere He carff a-wey at that strikyng; The stroke was smyten at his lykyng, He smote him doun vnto his chyn, That men my&yogh;t se the tethe with-In. DIodemes and kyng Antipe, With-oute trompe or pipe Or any other Melodye, Thei redyn to-geder with gret envye; Here speres brast In splentes, But thei fel not with here dentes, With that Iustyng ne that Iornay. But thei &yogh;ede not quyte a-way: \u00b6 Thei drow here swerdes of here scauberkis And smot on scheldes and hauberkes, The rynges barst, the nayles out, Thei were strawed al a-bout; Her woundes bledde, her flesch was tamet, The holest of hem ful sore was lamet. But at the laste be-tydde it so, That Diodemes smot In-two Thorow dou&yogh;tines duk Antipe gorge, With his swerd\u2014was fair of forge,\u2014 That he fel ded on gresse and rote, Off that wounde he hadde no bote. GLorious kyng lord Ihesu! Who-so hadde sen Ector vertu, How he the Gregeis ther reuerced MS. reuerted. , Helmes and hauberk how he persed, How he hem sclow by two and on,\u2014 He wolde haue sworn by Peter and Ion, By Marie bry&yogh;t and persones thre: That god that is In vnite Made neuere man that was so goode, Ne so many schedde of mannes blode, Ne non so strong as Ector was. By him my&yogh;t no man pas, That he my&yogh;t take or hent, That the lyff a-way ne went. Ector slees the men of Grece, Thei dyed thikkere then men dryues gece To chepyng-toun for to selle; It is a wondur for to telle, What men he sclow In felde, A-mong his foos how he him welde. THer come two kynges In that batayle, That saw Ector aboute rayle, As faucoun flees afftir drake, A-mong Gregeis gret murdir make; He made hem fle for drede a-ferd, As hound dos dere of his herd. That on was kyng Episcropus, That other his brother Cedyus; Thei rod to Ector bothe at ones, For to cleue him bothe flesch and bones. But Ector &yogh;aff off hem ri&yogh;t nou&yogh;t, Thei fond bothe that thei hadde sou&yogh;t; Episcropus, that ape and owle, Spak to Ector wordes foule, He called him \"fitz-a-putayn MS. fitz aputayn . ,\" And seyth: \"he was a cherl velayn.\" \u00b6 Than seide Ector: 'as I am kny&yogh;t, Thow schalt of me haue a foul dispit, Of me, thow kyng Episcropus,\u2014 Thow hast defouled me thus!' EPiscropus Ector defies. 'Fals ataynted traytour, thow lyes;' Saide Ector, 'I was neuere thral, I am fre, and my kynde al; In al my kyn is no throle, But kyng and duk, kny&yogh;t & erle; My ffader is a gentil kyng, Suche is non In thyn ospreyng! \u00b6 Fyfftene kynges, genteler than thow, Doth him omage and fewte now; And I, his sone, kny&yogh;t, and Air, Vndir me is man and mair, Duke and Prince, and kny&yogh;tes strong, And alle that euere to him long. My moder is a gentil quene, A trewe lady, and euere hath bene; \u00b6 Sche did her lord neuere falshede, But euere was trewe In word and dede. It semes wel thanne, that I am fre, I may be skyl no cherl be! And that thow schalt wite, if I the take, Thi proude wordes schal I slake. I drede neuere man of thi nacioun, Whi scholde I now fle a glotoun, \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit Episcropum Regem et Cedium Regem. Suche a caytyff, suche a wrecche! I holde the not worth a fecche!' \u00b6 Then was wroth Episcropus That Ector spake to him so spitous; Dispitusly Ector he myssayde, And sadly to him he layde With al his strengthe and al his myght, With Ector sone he gan to fyght. Episcropus that schrewe vnorne Might not his word performe; \u00b6 Ector sone to him gan take, He thoght him venge of that wrake; Ector bare his sword on hye,\u2014 For he hadde no spere him bye,\u2014 He &yogh;aff the kyng Episcropus Suche a recumbentibus, He smot In-two bothe helme & mayle, Coleret and the ventayle; He carff him doun In-to his vent, That to the deth sone he went. \u00b6 'Thow art now dede and ouer-throwen, Thi bostful wordes that thow blowen, Velenly thow hast thi mede; To myssay thow efft take hede!' CEdius saw his brother sclayn, The swot ran doun\u2014so doth the rayn\u2014 And of his eye doun by his lere, For his brother that was him dere. 'Alas,' seide he, 'that euere I was born! I se my brother In-sonder schorn, I schal him venge\u2014what-so be-tydes\u2014 Thoow my hert brest out at my sydes.' A thousand knyghtes that dou&yogh;ti were Cedius hadde with him there; Alle he called to him tho, And many other Gregeis mo; And asked him: \"what was his wille? Whi he so called and cried him tille?\" \u00b6 Thei asked of him: \"what him ayled?\" And he seide: \"his lyff him ffayled, No-thyng In erthe myght do him bote, Er he saw Ector on his fote,\"\u2014 'For he hath sclayn my dere brother, Episcropus, and many other; And him folwe I thus aboute, To seche Ector among the route, And leue him not, vnto he be founde, Ded or sclayn, or cast to grounde.' \u00b6 Cedius then with-oute lesyng Sou&yogh;t Ector faste with gret sikyng; A thousand kny&yogh;tes rod with him than With many another dou&yogh;ti man, To scle Ector and him wounde. Thei &yogh;ede him to seke & sone him founde, And of his stede thei bare him doun, And &yogh;ede to Ector alle en-viroun; And that me thenke no meruayle, For he wist not of here consayle. ECtor was to grounde I-bet, A thousand kny&yogh;tes thei on him set, To scle him ther thei all hadde thoght, For her euel wil ful thei boght. Cedius strok to him wel offte; Ector saw his arme on loffte Al redi him for to strike, Then gan Ector sore myslyke; \u00b6 Than seide Ector to Cedyus: 'Wenestow to sle me thus? I sette at nou&yogh;t alle thi Coueye, Whil I may se &yogh;ow with myn eye!' \u00b6 Ector &yogh;aff kyng Cedius on And cleff a-two his schuldir-bon, That hond & arme bothe fley a-way; The kyng fel a-doun, and ther he lay. THen come thedir Menelaus, And also the stronge Archilaus, And also the stronge Thelamon With many a kny&yogh;t, & kyng Makaron, The noble kyng Diodemes With many a thousand, & Vlixes; Ther come also the riche Athene, The noble man Duk Mescene. The riche kyng ther Emperour, That was her alther gouernour, He come doun with the rerwarde Strong and yrus as any lyparde. \u00b6 These kynges comes with here batayles, Eche man thanne Ector assayles; Thei died faste on euery syde. Alas now! how schal Ector abyde These kynges alle and her power, Whan hem come socour fer and ner? \u00b6 Prime was past, hit was Midday, And ney-honde none\u2014as I &yogh;ow say. Whan alle that armes bere myght\u2014 Off hem of Grece thei fayled lyght\u2014 Were comen doun to that batayle With men & hors and pedayle, With bowe and Arwe and alblast; Then were the Troyens sore agast, For thei hadde fou&yogh;ten for the best Al the day with-outen rest. \u00b6 Hic Achilles interficit Phillum Regem. For then were comen the kynges alle And begonne on hem to falle, Thei were ffresch, these other wery. Then were the Troyens al sory; Thei keped the Gregeys not-for-thi And stode a-&yogh;eyn strongfully; But thei my&yogh;t not endure so longe, The Gregeis were that tyme so stronge, That thei be-gan so to fle. It myght with hem no better be, So weri thei ben and ouer-charged, Here socour foule fro hem targed. \u00b6 Achilles folwed and alle hise, He ouer-toke the kyng Philluse; Phillus turned and with him fau&yogh;t, But suche a stroke Achilles him rau&yogh;t With his hondes sicurly, That he fel dede ther sodanly. ECtor saw that Phillus was ded, 'Alas'\u2014seide he\u2014'that I ete bred That euere was mad of corn of whete, That I schulde se my men so bete! I may not longe it suffry Off that Achilles with his sculkery.' He turned and loked his men toward: Thei flowe the while faste a-weyward, Thei wolde not bide be doune ne dale, For that the Gregeis were so fale. \u00b6 Then my&yogh;t men se the Gregeis ride, Thei closed Ector on eche a side, Some be-hynde and some be-fore. Ther was a kyng\u2014het Alpenore\u2014 Another also het Doryus, Thei were to Ector envyous; On eche a side Doryus him strikes, With his spere ful harde he prikes; Ector deled aboute lyueray To alle that euere come In his way. \u00b6 Then men my&yogh;t se swordes drawe\u2014 Thikkere then trees by wode-schawe\u2014 A-boute Ector, to bere him doun; Thei thoght he scholde neuere come to toun, But leue ther as a caytyff Clene ded with-oute lyff. A Thousand swerdes aboute him clatered,\u2014 As Masons hadde on stones batered,\u2014 But al was nou&yogh;t thei were aboute, For hem alle hadde he no doute: He deled a-boute him suche strokes, That he carf bothe hed and chokes, Hond and foot & haterelle; Many on ded to grounde felle. He sclow for-sothe the kynges two, And many a-nother kny&yogh;t also. \u00b6 To scle the Gregeis hadde he neuere pees; He cried and seyde to Achilles: 'Thow sclow long er a kyng of myne, Now haue I sclawe two of thyne. Come thi-selff to venge hem; I &yogh;eue of the right nou&yogh;t certeyn!' \u00b6 The Troiens thanne that were fled, When thei sey how Ector sped, How he him-self that stour mayntened, With hem-selff ful sore thei tened; When he hadde sclayn the kynges bothe, With hem-selff thei were wrothe, Thei turned a-&yogh;eyn on thaire enemys, And died faste on bothe parties Below the last line, upside down and very badly written, are the words: ' paphylun was an vter man bothe of le&yogh;ing & dissiuing ' [? desseiesing ]. . \u00b6 Hic Amphimates Rex Interfectus est. AVeas thanne his sword out-drow, A kyng of Grece ther-with he sclow; Amphimates his name was kyd That Eveas ther to dethe dyd. \u00b6 The Troiens keuered a-&yogh;eyn the feld, A&yogh;eyn the Gregeis fast thei held. Ther was a duk of gret emprise, That saw Ector hem alle to-brise Alle tho of Grece that he my&yogh;t reche; Ful ffayn wold he take wreche. \u00b6 He swore by him that sit in trone And made bothe sonne and Mone: \"He wolde him lette of his doyng, Off his slaw&yogh;t and his quellyng.\" Wel boldely to him he Ioyned, And with his spere faste ffoyned, That his mayles barst in-sonder,\u2014 That thoght Ector moche wonder;\u2014 He drow his sword and hoved stille And fau&yogh;t with Ector al his fille. \u00b6 Gret my&yogh;t the duke schewed thore, He layde on Ector strokes sore, He lettid him moche of his prowes, Off his scleyng and his rebelnes. \u00b6 Ector was with-al anoyed: 'Now is my my&yogh;t strongly distroyed,' Ector sayde, 'whan I schal thole Off on that is not worth a cole Suche vilony and suche repruse. I may wel say, I am refuyse Off alle the kynges sones of Troye, When that I suffre of suche a boye Suche vilonye to me be done,\u2014 Ne se I neuere sonne ne mone! \u00b6 Hic venit sagittarius. But thow schalt dere thi strokes a-bye, Thi hardines and thi folye! I schal kembe MS. kemble . thi &yogh;elowe lokke!' He &yogh;aff the duk suche a knokke, That helm and coyfe In-sunder &yogh;ede; He cleue him doun vnto his stede, That he fel doun on that other side. 'Now wil thow &yogh;iff me leue for to ride, Where that I loue & thow not me lette! Now hastow that I the be-hette!' NOw cometh a-nother kyng Episcropus With many a kny&yogh;t a-venterus, Out of Troie comes he ridande With men of Armes thre thousande. \u00b6 With him come A quaynte Archer, That mad is on suche a maner: He is halff hors and halff man. With hem of Troye thedir he ran; This archer ran to fight al naked. Herkenes now, how he was maked! Fro his nauel dounward He was hors, and man vpward; As a hors hadde he foure fete That he ran on, whan he schete; Bak and bely of hors & tayle, Thus was he maked saunfayle; \u00b6 His [s]kyn was hard and no-thyng thenne, His pyntel was of hors-kynne. And al that was fro the nauel aboue, Al was man\u2014for goddis loue:\u2014 Sides and ribbes, hed and hals, Bak and brest, & visage als, Armes, scholdres, chekes, & eres,\u2014 Al was of man that he op weres. Saue that he hadde of man no voyce,\u2014 As an hors made he the noyce, As it were an hors\u2014for-sothe\u2014he neyed.\u2014 Many a man thorow him ther dyed!\u2014 Tethe and gomes and mannes mouth\u2014 Now lyues no man by north ne south, That euere saw suche a best In feld ne toun ne in no forest! \u00b6 Al was of man bothe nese & throte, And fyngres als for his schote; But alle his membris lasse and more Were al be-growen with hors-hore, Bak and bely, & legge and nase, Brest, Armes, & his visage; As he were a hors, he neyes & ondes Line 7729 after 7730 in MS. . His eyen were lyke to brennande brondes; He fferd, as he scholde men haue brent With spark of fire that fro him glent; His vice was red as any fir. Bowe and arwe was his atir. WHan he was comen, he bent his bowe; Alle that euere him sawe Were ferd of him and strongly wondred; The horses snored, as it hadde thondred\u2014 So were thei of him agrysed, So brend his eyen and dredful glysed. Ther durst not on loke to him ward, Here hors turned aweyward; \u00b6 Thei wolde haue fled out of the feld, But eche a man his hors held: With mochel wo thei hem resteyed, To make hem dwelle thei offte assayed; Thei held hem stille with bridel & reyne, With mechel wo and mechel peyne. THis Archer schotes & sendes Arwes, He slees the Gregeis, as men take sparwes With lym or net or lym&yogh;erdes, Hors & man that Archer ferdes; And Ector slees al that he hittes. Ther is no man that on hors sittes Off hem of Grece, that may restay Ther hors lenger, but fled a-way; Ther is no man that ther abydes, But eche man aweyward rydes To here tentis & Pauelons. Achilles with his Murmondons MS. Murmondous . Vnto his strengthe a-weyward prikes; Ector faste afftir him strikes With hem of Troie; and that archer, He schet aboute him fer & ner With arwes that were wel I-heded Line 7765 after 7766 in MS. ; The Gregeis offte In-sunder hem scheded. \u00b6 A wonder chaunce he did hem thore: When thei of Grece discomfited wore And to ther tentis a-weyward fledde, Her Archer faste Afftir hem spedde; The Archer hadde so smartly ronnen, That he hadde lond of hem wonnen. As he thus ran aboute schetande, He saw a&yogh;ein him come prikande Diomedes vnto his tentis; The archer thenne an Arwe out-hentis, He smot at him\u2014so was he thare\u2014 Diomedes was wel ware, \u00b6 To schote at him so was he prest; He wiste neuere, whedir he my&yogh;t best To his pauyloun for to ride, For he most ride that Archer be-side,\u2014 \u00b6 Hic Diomedes occidit sagittarium. Or if he turned a-weyward, \u2014 His enemys come on him bakward: For if he come a-monges her hondes, For al the godis of Gregeis londes Wold thei not lette the kyng quyk go, With lyff and lym hem go fro. \u00b6 He was In gret a-visement, How he myght passe and be not schent; He saw be-fore him that foule best, The Troyens afftir him with many a crest. \u00b6 The Archer was the kyng so hende, To scle that kyng wel he wende: To that kyng he gan to hale, And drow an Arwe vp to the vale; And as he was In his losyng, Diomedes, that dou&yogh;ti kyng, Hadde his sword al redi drawe, That many of Troie hadde done of dawe. \u00b6 He strok his stede & to him rode, Ar euere arwe fro him glode: He smot the best vpon the bak And &yogh;aff him right an euel knak; He smot his bak [right] in-sunder, That he fel doun his hors fete vnder. NOw are the Gregeis fayn and bolde, The Archer lyes vpon the wolde Sclayn and dede, as men telles; None is ther that langer dwelles, Thei turned a-&yogh;eyn and toke the feld, Thei droff Troians fro tent to teld. \u00b6 To Ector rennes Achilles,\u2014 But [of] him &yogh;eues he not two strees, He kepte him and not for-soke. A stalworthe spere to him he toke And smot Ector with myght and mayn, And he smot him for-sothe a-&yogh;eyn, That eyther fel doun, er euere thei wiste, That bothe her eres the grounde kiste. \u00b6 But Ector was hurt the sorrour, For he come doun fro the fferour As he had ben a man [a-]rage. He toke Ector at his a-vauntage, Wher-by Ector In his ffallynge Toke wel more the brussynge, And lenger lay his hors beside Then Achilles dede that tide. \u00b6 Achilles ros op witterly And lepe on hors sicurly, He layde his hond on Ector stede And went a-way wel gode spede. ECtor was risen and vp-stode, He loked aboute as he were wode, And swor I-tened MS. & tened . and he sporles, The blod ran out at his nase-throlles; When he fro him his hors saw lede, Mouthe & nase began to blede, For tene & wo his hew chaunged. Ector afftir Achilles sewed, \u00b6 Opon his feet faste he hyes,\u2014 To his men faste he cryes: 'Se &yogh;e not, how myn enemy Ledes a-way my hors &yogh;ow by? Iff he him lede thus fro &yogh;ow alle, Foule reproues &yogh;ow schal be-falle! But &yogh;e him sonner ouertake, &YOGH;e bene not alle worthi an hake!' \u00b6 Eche man than afftir rides, Is none lengur that then a-bydes, \u00b6 Hic Greci tenuerunt Antynorem Regem.

Many of Grece bowte his takyng, Men my&yogh;t se thenne speres schakyng: \u00b6 Ector sclees and Ector felles; His hors takyng dere he selles; He riues helmes and cleues hedes; Ther is no Gregeis that him MS. that thei him .

ANtenor rode aboute strikande,\u2014 Fro Ector was he fer fyghtande On that other half of that batayle, And that was him to wrothe-haile: For thei of Grece opon him throng And him be-closed hem among; His men bacward fro him frusched, And many of hem to grounde crusched. \u00b6 Antenor did that In him was, But he myght not fro hem pas, For thei of Grece were more then he: Thei toke him at that semble And sent him to her MS. his . pauylons With-outen any hauylons, And held him In her prisoun. Polydomas of gret renoun Therfore was he ful sori,\u2014 At the head of this page, not very distinctly: Aynesworth . That was his sone, was him bi: His hert forsothe wex al cold, When the tydandes were y-told. \u00b6 Gret meruayles tho in hem he wrou&yogh;t, Off his lyff as he nad rou&yogh;t, But he ne hade no space at his lykyng, For it was thenne ney euenyng; \u00b6 The day was gon, thei hadde no lyght, For it was wel with-Inne nyght. To dwelle lenger was erased between lenger and thenne . thenne was not gode, The[i] leue ffyghtyng, as hem be-hode, And turned hom with weri bones,\u2014 Eche man to his owne wones,\u2014 Vn-Armed hem, and wente to reste; To house come many a weri geste. \u00b6 Thei layde borde & clothe & &yogh;ede to mete. Polidomas my&yogh;t not for-&yogh;ete Off al that ny&yogh;t for no thyng His dere fader takyng: Ful litel he drank and les ete, The teres fel to his fete. \u00b6 Off alle that ny&yogh;t my&yogh;t he not slepe, Al that ny&yogh;t he lay and wepe, Til hit was day, the sonne gan schyne, Euermore dured his pyne. Then he ros vp, as most nede, To arme him, his men to lede, A&yogh;eyn Gregais to fight to-morn. Wo was him, that he was born, For sorwe and care and mornyng That he toke for his lordis takyng. \u00b6 The nyght is passed, hit is day, The sonne hath dreuen the sterres away, Ther is no sterre opon the sky; The sonne is resen & schynes on hy, Fair & bry&yogh;t he schewes his bemes. Thei risen vp of here dremes, Off Troie and Grece [the kny&yogh;tes] bothe; Many of hem schal be wrothe: \u00b6 Hadde thei of here sweuen taken tent, That thei hade wyten, what it hade ment, When hardi thynges thei did mete, Tho that schold her lyf for-lete! But ther-of toke thei kepe no-thyng, But busked hem In the dawyng, And Armed hem In sail & schip; And than thei &yogh;ede and toke a sop, Thei ete a sop, and afftir dranke, For In batayle thei wolde be strang. \u00b6 When thei wente out of here hale, Many drank nother wyn ne ale Affter that, ne ete, ne drank, But layen ded & foule stank! Eche man sclow other & felle doun, Many of hem come neuere to toun Hole a&yogh;eyn, as thei &yogh;ede out; Some lefft his hed, and som his snout, Some to-hewen and foule ferd with; Some les his lyff, and som his lyth. WHan bothe parties to-gedir wore, Thei smetyn to-gedur strokys sore: When thei were comen out of her hales, And thei of Troye out of here sales And passed her &yogh;ates & here dikes, Eche man at other strikes; He drow his swerd, and he his bowe, Mechel sorwe ther was y-sowe: He anon, his knyff he drawes, \u2014And he is ded,\u2014and ouer-thrawes, He schakes his spere, he rides owerre, And he fel doun I-hurt MS. and hurt . wel sorre, He is ded, and he is sclayn, And he is born thorow the brayn, He ses his lyuer and his entrelles; Michel is the wo that hem ayles. ANd thus ferde thei fro that thei ros Til the day a-weyward gos, And nyght was comen, and lyght was fayled. Ector euere aboute rayled, As MS. And . faucoun doth opon his pray; The bodyes thikke aboute him lay, That ther lay with dethis wounde; Many a kny&yogh;t fel to the grounde. Ful sorily he hem ransaked Fro that morwe that he waked Til euen-tide that home he &yogh;ede, For he hadde neuere so moche nede To help and socour his meygne, As he hadde at that Iorne. \u00b6 For Gregeis were so styff and stronge, That thei his men doun sclow & sclonge, As thei of hem hadde &yogh;eue right nou&yogh;t; But euere among thei it dere bou&yogh;t: For Ector sclow hem al a-boute, Many Gregeis made he loute; \u00b6 Ector hem sclow, as it were mys, Thei died faste on bothe parties Off hem of Troye & of Gregeis, Thei lefft liggyng many karkeis. Echon wolde other sclo, Off Grece died fele, of Troye wel mo. Glad was he that ther ascaped. The better side the Gregeis schaped As for that day\u2014as I herde telle. With hem of Troye so it be-felle: Ne hadde dou&yogh;ti Ector ben, Thei hadde not lefft a cyteseyn With him In the feld, that thei nad fled; So were the Troiens sore adred, For thei of Grece were so strongful, That thei vnnethe stode hem a pul MS. apul . . BVt Ector mayntened his syde For al here strengthe and here pride, He brekes her hedes, her helmes & scheldes, Ful nobly his men he ledes. And thus he heldis with gret labour A&yogh;eyn Gregeis al day that stour, Til ny&yogh;t was comen and day gon, And thei departid euerychon On bothe parties more and les, For it was so gret derknes. \u00b6 Thei &yogh;ede euen home to her hous, Thei fond ther many a sori spous, That sori were for here husbondis; Some lay dede on the sondes: \u00b6 The wyues of Troye made gret mornyng; Amonges the Gregeis was gret roryng, Thei blew and cried\u2014as wilde bere brayes\u2014 For her frendes that died tho dayes; Thei wende neuere that day abyde, That thei scholde hom with her lyff ride, To passe ouer the Grekissh wawes. Thei hadde In honde wel carful sawes A-mong the grete and the smale, Al ny&yogh;t ther-of thei hadde here tale. \u00b6 That Agamenon was vp rysen, That hadde Antenor In his prison; When he saw it was day cler, He sent out his Messanger To Priamus and to his baronage, Trewes to aske and trewes to wage,\u2014 Off thre monthes thei him besought, Til the ded MS. he did . to erthe was brought. DIomedes and Vlixes To Priamus were sent in pees, To aske this trewe, and make it stable On bothe parties with-oute fable: That non of hem schuld other dere With non harm In maner of were Lastyng the terme of that trewe, And who-so did, it scholde him rewe; Thei be Iugement const[r]eyned To suffre therfore that men ordeyned. \u00b6 These kynges to here hors take,\u2014 Wel richely dyght ffor worschepe sake: Thei dede on robes that hem best payes, Off riche gold were alle the rayes, Off riche scarlet were bothe here champes, Poudred ful of golden lampes, With lilye-leues and fflour-delys; The robes were of mochel prys, \u00b6 Thei were parted with riche palle. The knyghtes were fair & clene with-alle, Here hodes dyght with gold ribanes,\u2014 Better weres non among the Danes;\u2014 Thei were with gold wel I-fret, The ffloures of gold on hem set, With wilde bestes and fflyande ffoules, Liouns, lipardes, ernes, and owles Off riche gold that louely schon; In hem stode many a riche ston, Saphur riche, and selidone, Erbe-de-bothe, & Cassidone, And euere among the dyamaund, Sewed wel with gode orfoyle-suand; \u00b6 The frette of gold was like a belle, So were thei gret & horrible; Worth michel gode thei were apraysed, Thei were so couched and hye vp-raysed. \u00b6 Thei rode to-geder with-oute debate; Thei are now comen to Troye &yogh;ate, In forme of pes thei aske entre: \"To lete hem In for charite, That thei my&yogh;t wende with-out outrage To Priamus on here message.\" THe &yogh;ates are opened and vndon, The kyng[es] were leten In son, Thei were I-kept with curtesye. Ther was a kny&yogh;t of genterye, A riche man, that het Delon, A gret courser sat he vpon; He was In Troye bothe geten & born, He saw the kynges come him be-forn. \u00b6 On his hors that he be-strode A&yogh;eyn tho kynges he thenne rode, And kept hem faire as kny&yogh;t curtays, And led hem In-to the kynges palays; He led hem bothe In-to the halle: The kynges were at the mete alle, \u00b6 Priamus and his kny&yogh;tes of my&yogh;t; Ther-Inne was a louely sight. When Delon broght thes messageres To the kyng and his consaleres, To speke with him, her erand to schewe,\u2014 Off his consayl were ther but fewe. \u00b6 Delon broght hem to the bordis, Thei gret the kyng with louely wordis, Thei told her erand and asked respit: \"That alle my&yogh;t reste, bothe knaue & kny&yogh;t, On bothe parties monthes thre By siker hostage & gode surte.\" With louely wordes and faire spekynges Kyng Priamus answered the kynges: \u00b6 'I holde him certes with-oute manhede, That loueth wrong or any falshede; I dar of trewe make myn avaunt: I schal helde siker that I graunt, I schal holde trewes I vndirtake; I schal hem helde and siker make, That non of myne schal do &yogh;ow skathe, Nother late, erly, ne rathe Lastyng the trewe; and &yogh;e also The same a-&yogh;eyn to me schal &yogh;e do. \u00b6 But &yogh;e wot wel: It is not skylle, That I assente the trewes tille With-oute red of my consayle, Off my baronage, & myn avayle That ar with me In myn enprise. But I for &yogh;ow now schal arise And herkyn, what my consayl sais; So longe &yogh;e schal dwelle In peis. Iff thei assent, I graunt for me: What thei wol say, &yogh;e schal sone se.' PRiamus wol no lengur ete, He settis a-way drynke & mete, For curtasie of his two gestis He settis a-way borde and trestis. He wolde thei were sone answerd, That ther drecchyng hem not dered. \u00b6 Priamus did to him calle Kynges and dukes and lordes alle; Thei stode aboute him on a rowe, He spak to hem with wordes lowe: 'Wol &yogh;e thus longe trewes fulfille?' Sayde Priamus\u2014'say me &yogh;oure wille: What schal I tille MS. telle . hem now say? Schal I seye: \"&yogh;e,\" or: \"nay\"? \u00b6 Avise &yogh;ow now alle In-fere, Now &yogh;e ben to-geder here: What is &yogh;oure wit? how thenke &yogh;ow? Hope &yogh;e hit be for oure prow To graunt this trewe? wol &yogh;e assente? Telle me &yogh;oure best a-visemente!' THe kyng[es] sayde by on name: \"To graunt trewe, it was no schame,\"\u2014 'Sithen thei it aske at oure request, Hit is worschepe to oure behest; And we may reste vs the whiles, For we ben ful of woundes and biles, That ben ful of quytour & wores; We may the while hele oure sores. We wol the trewe graunte and hauen, Sithen thei comen hit to crauen.' \u00b6 Ther was no lordyng In that halle, That thei ne graunte the trewes alle And wel apayed\u2014saue Ector one; Ther-to spak he wordes none; He saw what thei alle thought, Therfore wolde he say right nought; He saw it was al ther MS. alther . lykyng To be In pes and haue restyng; \u00b6 Hic Greci pecierunt pacem. And not-for-thi hit liked him ille, That thei schuld ligge so longe stille, And for he was not al wel payd, To hem thus mechel Ector sayd: \u00b6 'The Gregeis haue the trewes craue, For thei wolde her ded men graue; I dar wel say: hit is not so. But I wol not the trewes vndo, Sethen &yogh;e alle the trewes wol holde; I wole it be as &yogh;e haue tolde; But I dar say that thei thenke falsnesse MS. salsnesse distinctly. , Thei are purvayd of gret queyntenesse. \u00b6 I wot ful wel, her mete hem fayles, Thei haue defaut of here vitayles; Thei may not fyght, for strengthe hem fayles.

And we that while oure good schal waste, Hit wol vs faile now In haste; Thei wol mis-lede MS. vs lede. vs with a trayn. What good be-houes vs to sustayn \u00b6 The folk that is with vs her-In?

But now &yogh;e haue graunted to take hede THis trewes to holde, I say for me: I wole right wel thei holden be; For I schal neuere a&yogh;eyn calle That thyng that &yogh;e assenten alle.

I holde me payd of &yogh;oure Iugement, I wol not fro &yogh;ow disasent.' \u00b6 Then were the MS. we. Troiens mury & glad, When thei leue of Ector had, That thei scholde reste so longe; Many man for Ioye songe. Hit was gret murthe & Ioye To hem of Grece and eke of Troye, That trewe is tane and last so longe; That thei myght bothe ride & gonge To take her murthe and her solace, Eche man is glad In that place. THese lordes toke leue of the kyng And wente hom al hying; And to the Gregais hom he brynges Off his trewis gode tydynges, That thei of Troie hath graunt the trewes. Then my&yogh;t men here many glewes, Pipe and Trompe, and many nakeres, Synfan, lute, and Citoleres; Ther was so many a daunce. Thei made tho gret puruyaunce Off corn and hay, of wyn and otes, And thei songen wel merie notes; Thei hele her woundes In gret quiete, With mochel Ioye thei dronke and ete. And thei of Troye were as fayn Off here reste, bothe kny&yogh;t & swayn, And hele her woundes at here layser, \u2014 Kyng[es] and kny&yogh;t[es] & kayser. And al the while the trewes held, The[i] speke to-geder In toune & ffeld; And that riche kyng Thoas, That with Ector takyn was, Scholde go quyte to his Pauyloun, And Antenor home to Troye toun. \u00b6 Ayther of hem the prisons hom sendes With-oute raunsoun & with-oute amendes, For that on that other is gre; And so schal thei quyte be. THe trewes is graunt & schal be holden: Riche robes were then vnfolden: Many a coffre was vnstoken, To drawe out robes that were y-loken; Eche man his coffer vnsperes And takes gerdeles of riche barres With bokeles of gold and fair pendaunt, Wel anamayled with the mordaunt; \u00b6 Many a broche and many an oche, To stike on hede and on pouche. Thei toke out rynges and made hem gay, Thei leued In Ioye & mechel play, The whiles the trewes last; But al was lefft, when that past. Whil it was trewes, was many hode Gayli wered with mochel gode; \u00b6 When thei were gon, thei layde hem doun And toke the stelen haberioun, The ketil-hattes and stelen hure, And layd away the gay pelure; Thei toke her spores with kene roweles, And leyde a-way the riche jeueles MS. reueles. . \u00b6 Hic. Ector ibat ad Reges Grecorum in tempore pacis. HIt was a day lastyng the trewes, And eche a lord his clothyng newes; Ector was ffair and semely dyght. The day was fair, the sonne was bryght, Merye synges the nyghtyngale, The throstil, and the wilde wode-wale; It is gret Ioye to here the larke In toun and feld, fforest and parke. \u00b6 Ector sayde: \"that he wolde go Achilles to se and other mo; He wolde with him haue daliaunce, To se her hertes and her contenaunce.\" He rod him out of his Cite, The lordes of Grece for to se; \u00b6 With him &yogh;ede many a riche lordyng, Many a duke, and many a kyng. He was welcomed with gret honour To Agamenoun her Emperhour, The kynges did him worschepe alle; Achilles bed him to his halle, Ful Inwardly he him be-sought: \"That he fro him departid noght, Til thei to-gedir In his tent Hadde dronken vernage and pyment, And that thei my&yogh;t to-gedur carpe;\u2014 Hit were him leuere then note of harpe.\" \u00b6 Ector graunted alle his prayeres, He &yogh;ede with him and alle his feres. When thei were comen and alle doun set, The wyn was asked and forth y-fet; At here comyng thei made fair wedur And spak of many thynges to-gedur. Achilles euere Ector be-holdes, His legges anon on crosse he foldes, For he was naked, he was fayn. He my&yogh;t not his tong constrayn, He most nedes say out his wille, For the disorder of the MS. from here to line 9124 consult the Intro|duction, and my paper in the Engl. Stud. 29, p. 390 sqq. He my&yogh;t not holde his tonge stille; And that was mochel his vilony, He sayde to Ector al an hy: \u00b6 'Sithen I se the, I haue desired To se the, Ector, vn-atired; And now hastow me Ioyful maked, Now I se the vn-dight and naked. And I hadde sclayn the, Then wolde I fayn be; And I haue offte assayed my my&yogh;t, When we haue met to-gedur In fight; Ful sorefully hastow me gret, When that thow with me has met R iiij below this line in the right corner of the page. , Mi blod thow MS. that thow. hast offte y-tamed, I haue of the wel offte be lamed, Many a strok has thow me payed; By thi strokes haue I assayed That thow art stalworth and strong; Thoow I the hate, I do the no wrong, \u00b6 I am &yogh;it hurt of thi strykyng.

AChilles was gretly aschamed That Ector thus foule him defamed, He was a-schamed many-folde That he so litel by him tolde Among his men ther In his halle, That he asked him fight amonges hem alle Be-twene hem two with-outen mo. He was Angwysched so for wo, That of his forhede barst the swote, That al his face ther-of was wote; He ferde as he hadde ben araged, That Ector him that batayle waged, And seyde to him as man that yred: 'Thow schalt haue that thow hast desired!

But that thyng my&yogh;t not be hid: Among the Gregeis it was kyd, That Achilles hadde take on hande, The next day afftir ffolwande \u00b6 To ffight with Ector man for man. This thing wel swithe a-boute ran Fro kyng to kyng, fro halle to boure: So it was seyde to the Emperoure And alle that other kynges be-dene, How ffight was taken hem be-twene, \u00b6 And no man my&yogh;t here ire a-swage And thei hadde &yogh;euen to-gedur wage: And if it schape be-twene hem thore That Ector discomfit wore, Catel, godes, and the land Schal be-leue In Gregeis hand; And if it happe with Ector so That Achilles he my&yogh;t sclo, That he and his schul dwelle in pees, And alle the Gregeis on a res Out of that lond thei schul wende, And ther no lenger schold thei lende. THes thinges were y-told and brou&yogh;t, The Gregeis wondred In here thou&yogh;t, Hem wondred of Achilles, That he on that wyse graunted pes, To ffight with Ector al alone; Ther-fore thei maked moche mone, Off that couenaund that hem was told; The kynges seyde: \"thei wolde not hold\"; \u00b6 Kynges and dukes and lordes alle For the disorder of the MS. at this place cf.

Seide: \"thei wolde a&yogh;eyn that calle, Thei wolde for-sake it euery a dele, Thei nold not so put her quarele In a-venture ne In Iopardie.\" Thei seyde: \"it was but folye\"; Thei seyde: \"it was not so done.\" Thei made hem redi alle & some, \u00b6 Alle the lordes that ther ware, To Achilles for to fare; Thei hyed faste, wold thei not blynne, Er thei come to his Inne, Ther thei bothe to-geder stode. These lordes alle to hem &yogh;ode, \u00b6 Achilles his wordis alle with-sayde, Ther-with were thei euel ypayde Off his profre ne of his a-vaunt; That he hem bad, wold thei not graunt: Thei wolde neyther putte lyff ne lym A-&yogh;eyn Ector for-sothe In hym; Thei seyde: \"it was not equyte, That lyff & lym schuld so put be\"\u2014 'Off so fele kynges as are now here Be-twene &yogh;ow In such manere.' TRoiens come thedir gret won, The lordes of Grece ben ther echon; Ther standes a-boute hem many hundre To parte the kny&yogh;tes two In-sundre; Thei seyde echon at on assent: \"Thei wolde not holde that Iugement.\" \u00b6 Ector my&yogh;t not the batayle haue, He my&yogh;t no more ther-of craue, For thei of Grece with-sayd it alle, Kyng & kny&yogh;t, bothe fre and thralle. Hit was no bote hem to greue, Off hem of Grece toke he his leue, \u00b6 Opon his hors vpward he lyghtes And wente to Troie with alle his kny&yogh;tes, An-angered sore and alle his. Thei of Grece toke ther-of no pris, Hem angered sore that he come thore; Achilles schold abye hit sore. Thei wolde his hond were an harowe-tynde, His herte a mylleston for to grynde, His flesche & bon as assches smale, Ther-of wolde thei &yogh;eue no tale. ALas Ector, what was the schaped, When he fro the so skaped! Fals fortune was not thi ffrend, Whan sche delyuered him fro hir bend; Sche made the Gregais alle say \"nay,\" For sche hadde cast his endyng-day. Kyng Priamus, where was thi grace?

The E in blue paint. ECtor fightes with Achilles, He hewys his mayles res by res, He hewys hem alle In taterwagges, His hauberk heng alle In ragges; And he &yogh;eues him a-&yogh;eyn good pay, The grettest strokes that he may. \u00b6 But Ector &yogh;aff Achilles one And claff his flesch on-to the bone, Hit barst his helme & his coyfe eke, And it made him the grounde seke: The stroke was gret\u2014as I &yogh;ow tolde,\u2014 Achilles my&yogh;t not his sadel holde, Opon his hors my&yogh;t he not sitte, When sir Ector hadde him so hitte. \u00b6 He lefft his hors and fel to grounde And swoned sore In that stounde; Top ouer tayl he gan loute. The Gregeis gadered him aboute, His Murmidones were alle agast He hadde be sclayn, for he was cast; Thei stode aboute him alle fyghtande, For Ector scholde not come him hande, Til he were rysen & vpward couered: Many a man aboute him houered, His body al for to fende, That Ector schold not come him hende. \u00b6 Then my&yogh;t men se strokes ride, Gregeis feld on eche a syde That thedir come In his defence, For thei made ther thanne resistence A-&yogh;eyns Ector & his Troians: He sclow that tyme a thousand Danes That then defended sir Achilles, Many on swalt In his owne gres. \u00b6 Ector wolde Achilles take, And the Gregeis defence did make: Thei wolde rather dye right ther, Then Achilles I-take wer. Achilles stode on fote & fau&yogh;t, Til he was almost out of mau&yogh;t: \u00b6 He was careful and wel drery, For that he was so wery, He my&yogh;t not wel his scheld vp bere, He my&yogh;t not him fro Ector were, He my&yogh;t not wel his breth blowe, He was In poynt to ouer-throwe; His vertu hadde he clene lore, But Ector wolde not lette ther-fore. \u00b6 But than come thedir Thelamon, With alle his men Agamenon, And the dou&yogh;ti Menescens: That halp him wel a-&yogh;eyn Troyens, With mychel wo and gret trauayle Halp thei him In that batayle. \u00b6 Thei brou&yogh;t him hors, and brou&yogh;t him vp, He hadde lau&yogh;t many a pop, For ther was many a strok &yogh;euen;\u2014 But it was welney euen. ECtor was sori that it was ny&yogh;t, Er thei of Grece were discomfit: For hadde thei had the lyght of day, Achilles hadde not went a-way To [be] taken then vnto his teld, But hadde died In that feld. Thei departid on bothe side\u2014 For it was ny&yogh;t and derk that tyde,\u2014 \u00b6 Ector to Troye ouer the downes, And Gregeis to here Pauylones. The clothis were layd, and thei doun lyght: To soper were thei alle dyght, Thei sette hem doun and ete & drank; Many hadde his clothis al blank Off blod that thei hadde bled. Thei ete and drank & &yogh;ede to bed, And rested hem, til the sonne vp ros: To Arme him there eche man gos, \u00b6 The stour a-&yogh;eyn wolde thei be-gynne, For good on erthe wol thei not blynne; Her hors are brou&yogh;t, and thei vp lepe, Thei ren to-gedre on an hepe, As thei hadde don that day be-fore; Ther died be-twene hem many a score. BOthe parties In the feld were prest, In pees wol thei neuere rest; Eche man rides vnto his macche, Many a man here deth there lacche. Whan thei to-gedre were met with speres, Many on other ouer beres; Thei drow here swerdes of good metal; Er it be ny&yogh;t, manye dye schal. Echon on MS. or . other ffaste doth bete, Ryght as threscheres doth on whete; On smytes his felawe thorow the pap, And he &yogh;eues him a sori wap. \u00b6 Thei sclow or euen a thousand knyghtes, Men saw neuere suche other fyghtes\u2014 Sithen In erthe god made man,\u2014 That of so litel thing be-gan! Ne so fele lordes with-outen fayle Were neuere sclayn at on batayle, Ne men of Armes and also naked, As were at Troye\u2014sithen man was maked! \u00b6 Hic pugnant .xxx. dies absque respectu. Some were smyten of by the knes, Some thorow-out bothe thies, Some lay dede, & som cast doun, And some lay wounded and brostoun; Some In his body bar a tronchoun, As it were put In with a ponchoun. The while thei myghten endure, Thei threw doun men\u2014I telle &yogh;ow sure,\u2014 Thei smyten hors and helmes barst, The while the brethe wold hem last. MIchel sorwe hem was a-mong; Sicurly hit were to long Me to telle, and &yogh;ow to here, How thei ffau&yogh;t echon In-fere, I may not al the dedis devyse; Ther wolde no boke it al suffise Alle here dedis for to holde, Iff thai schulde alle be y-tolde, And I schulde alle here dedis say, How thei fau&yogh;t to-geder euery day. The bible ne no Missale, The legende ne no Iornale, The Grael ne the Tropere, Schold not holde here dedis plenere. \u00b6 For .xxx. ti dayes with-outen pes Thei fau&yogh;t to-gedur with-outen ses, Al was sprad bothe diche and bank With dede bodies that lay & stank. Men redes In gestes of dou&yogh;ti men, How thei fou&yogh;ten to-geder dayes ten,\u2014 Euery day with-outen rest,\u2014 To se whiche of hem were best; Men tellen of Ywayn and Wade In gestes that of hem ben made, How thei fau&yogh;t a day or two, And afftir that more than so: Thei ffau&yogh;t ffourtene nyght, And that was kampiouns right. \u00b6 But I say: Ector and his feris, Achilles als & his comperis, Thei fau&yogh;t to-geder dayes thre, And wold thei not in pes be; Thei fau&yogh;t to-gedir fourtene nyght, And that was the Troiens right; With-outen rest thei fau&yogh;t al-weyes, Til thei hadden fou&yogh;ten .xxx. ti dayes\u2014 Euery day til it was ny&yogh;t, That neuere be-lan whil thei hadde lyght. \u00b6 Now wol I of this thing telle, I may not alle here dedis melle; For mochel wo be-twene hem wex: Off Ector brethere were sclayn sex With-In the dayes that thei so fau&yogh;t, And Ector also a sore wounde lau&yogh;t In his visage on of that day, Wherby Ector In his bed lay In Ylion a ful gret stounde, Er he were hol of that wounde. THretti dayes when he hadde foughten With-outen reste bothe euen & oughten, Priamus sente to the Gregeis Kynges two that were curtays, And other lordes mo wente hem with, Trewe to aske a six monyth. And thei it graunte al at her wille, Thei were fayn to holde hem stille And rest In pes al that terme; The trewes is graunt and holden ferme, \u00b6 Hic ceperunt pacem ad inuicem per vj. Menses. And therto haue thei trowthes plyght: \"That nother of hem be dayes ne nyght Lastynge the trewes schal other wayte With vilonye ne other desayte; And if any man be gylti founden, Hand and fote schal he be bounden, On galowe-tre to honge hye For his ffalshede and his folye.\" \u00b6 The trewes be graunt a ful half &yogh;ere Be-twene kynges, dukes, & bachelere, Alle that on bothe sides wore: Now euery man helis his sore, Alle taken medycine that myster hade, To reste that while alle were glade. And Ector is to Ilion brou&yogh;t, A riche bed ffor him was wrou&yogh;t, He was leyd In that paleis, That was of riche werk Sarsaneis; \u00b6 His bed was made In that riche halle And y-couered with many riche palle: To him come fycisiens, The beste of alle Troyens, And soughte his woundes on eche halue, And leyde ther-to plastres & salue, And &yogh;aff him herbes & gode raysyns, And heled him vp with gode medysyns. IN Ilyon Ector was layd In that riche halle\u2014as I sayd;\u2014 For alle these lordes & the ladyes, That were of worschepe and of pris, Scholde him comforte In his penaunce And with the speche do him legaunce And of his Angwis and his sekenesse, To come to him bothe more & lesse. Hit was an halle of gret noblay, Aula In red paint. . The halle ther-as Ector lay; The toures were of out-done hight, I-made with wonder art and slight. If thow wolt that halle discryue, Sicurly &yogh;e wolde not leue The wonder werk of the Pyleres; Men wolde holde hem grete lyeres, Man wolde wene that men did lye, And holde it alle for fairie. \u00b6 But man wolde wene In his thoght, That suche werk myght neuere be wroght; For now is non so glorious, Ne non In this world so vertuous, As Ilion was the while it stode, I-set ful of stones and perles gode; Rofe and wal and euery a gable, Dore and wyndowe, trestles and table, Courbel, beme, and euery a ston, With riche gold was vmbygon. \u00b6 Alle the walles of that wones Were thikke y-set with precious stones; A thousand rubies on a rowe Were set a-bouen on the wowe. Ther stode a-long & eke a-crois Many a riche erbe-debois; The matistre and a riche saphur, And other stones many & sur; Ther stode many a charbocle-ston, That as bry&yogh;t aboute hem schon In that halle aboute mydnyght, As doth the somerday lyght. That halle was brode & long, Off semely werk sicur & strong, \u00b6 Qualiter palacium Regis Troiani factum est. Two hundred fet was it be-met. On stones twelue was hit al set Off Alabaster that wele were wrou&yogh;t, It was gret meruayle how thei were bou&yogh;t Vnto that werk to rayse that ground, It was meruayle where men thei found. \u00b6 He was worthi be called a clerk, That of twelue stones made suche a werk. The halle flore was paued al Thorowout with clene cristal; In euery a hirne was set a post Off worthi werk with mychel cost; On euery a post stode an ymage As he hadde ben In fauntel-age; Alle were wrou&yogh;t of gold ffyn, Hede, body, visage, and eyn. \u00b6 Ther was no man MS. noman . In al that land That he ne wende thei hadde ben lyuand: So vereili thei loked and smyled, Many a man ther-with was giled; Off here makyng and of here lokes Many meruayles In his bokis. DAres wrot\u2014I telle it &yogh;ow,\u2014 That I wol not speke of now: \"The walles of that halle strey&yogh;t Were two thousand fet of hey&yogh;t, \u00b6 Altitudo Murorum In one line, sign blue, words red; but on the left side in MS. . And &yogh;it ther-to ffyue hundrid als,\"\u2014 As Dares seis that neuere was fals. \u00b6 Dares seis: \"the toures were so hy, That thei wente to the sky, So ney were thei the firmament A-boue the cloudes verament, A man that stode with-oute doute On hem, my&yogh;t se al the lond aboute, And other londes a-cost also On euery a side, that marches ther-to.\" \u00b6 Then were thei hye verament, Thei hadde nede of a good fundement; Euery a ston of Marbil was As smethe as any glas, Euery a ston was smethe schauen. The walles were with bestes grauen, Ther was no best In wildernes, Forest, ne feld, more ne les, That thei ne were ther wele entayled, Wilde ne tame non ther fayled. BEfore the dore was set a tre, \u00b6 Arbor ad hostium Sign in blue, words in red (in two lines thus). . That fair and semely was to se: The tre was al of riche gold Fro the grounde vnto the mold, And alle the bowes of that erberye Were siluer & gold with-outen lye; For euere was on of siluer bry&yogh;t, A-nother of gold that was so ly&yogh;t. \u00b6 Ther was neuere fruyt that euere grewe That thei ne hongen ther In here hewe, But al was MS. But al that was . siluer and gold with-Inne. This werk was mad with quaynte gynne. In that halle ende was mad his dese, Richeli made it was alweyes: \u00b6 Ther was a bord of gret richesse, In al this world such another ther nesse MS. wesse . . In that other ende of that riche halle, Wel fair vpright a&yogh;eyn the walle, He let make a riche auter, But ther-on was neuere seid no sauter. And afftir that he sette In that ende His god Iouys, he held his frende; For whan he wolde his help craued, He wende he my&yogh;t him haue saued. \u00b6 A ffair ymage that kyng did make Off ffyn gold ffor his goddis sake; On that auter did he sette hit, Off pure gold was hit I-bet; Hit was .xv. cubitis long. He sette hit there with mochel song, With ffythel, harpe, and mynstrasie, With mychel merthe and melodye. \u00b6 He spende on him gret tresoure, Certes he loste al his laboure. He made to him a redy way Off twenti grecis of marbil gray, That he & other my&yogh;t come him to, When that thei wolde him worschepe do. And thus was maked that riche halle, As I haue told to &yogh;ow alle. ECtor liggis In Ilioun; At his hed sat kyng Menoun And Hectuba, his Moder, the quene, So did Eleyne and Pollexene; That louely lyff dame Andromede To Ector takes sche gode hede: Wel tenderly the kny&yogh;t sche &yogh;emed, That fair lady that wel be-semed. \u00b6 Kynges fele a-boute come And comfort him alle & some Off his hurtyng & malady, For his sorwe were thei drery. Kyng Priamus let bery With careful herte and no-thyng mury His sixe sones that died tho dayes, Euerychon be-sydes other he layes. \u00b6 Hic Ector sanatus est. He bad that echon schuld haue By him-self a riche graue: Here graues were sone y-made Bothe with schouele & with spade; And leyd hem ther-In bothe body & bones, And heled a-bouen with riche stones. And so was grauen eche a brother, A litel echon fro other. \u00b6 Thei of Grece her riche kynges Graued also, here lordynges; And tho that were of lasse renoun Thei gadered to hepes with-oute the toun And brende her bodyes alle by-dene, And made the feld of hem ful clene, That no stynk of hem schulde rise, Hem to dere on no wyse. ECtor heles and coueres faste, His Angwys almost a-way is paste, He may bothe go & stande, In that halle is he walkande; And alle these other ben ner-honde heled. Delful dyntis were ther deled, When thei were heled and comen samen; Ther by-gynne a grisly gamen: Many on schal to the dethe wende, Er thei efft-sones make an ende. \u00b6 For Ector was fful sore a-greued That his visage was so cleued; He het his men for euene or od, That ther hors be faste y-schod, And her harneis redi dight, Her aketoun strong, her brynys bryght; 'That hors ne harneis &yogh;ow not faile A-&yogh;eyn the tyme of oure batayle.' WInter is went\u2014as I wene\u2014 The leues growen In greues grene, The ffloures sprede & spedly sprynge, The thrustil sittes & mury synge, The sonne is hote, the terme goth out. The Troiens are bothe stiff & stout, And so ar Danes and eke Gregeis: Alle &yogh;are thei ben In here harneis For to fare & that stoure mayntene, But thei schal passe with moche tene. \u00b6 The trewes is passed and alle termened, And alle ben redy & haue dyned, Many an helme is set on hede That long er nyght schal ligge dede; The ladyes for her lordes caren, For thei wot neuere how thei schal faren; Thei made gret mornyng a-mong, Thei tare hir heer, hir handis wrong. \u00b6 The lordes hem busked & toke here caples, Men brynge hem speres of gode maples, And scheldes stronge thei brynge als, To honge semely a-boute her hals. \u00b6 Ector bad thei schulde ride, Thei wol not lenger here abyde: Thei riden forth out of the toun With scheld and spere & gonfanoun. And thei of Grece were gadered alle With-oute the diche be-fore the walle, In-myddis the feld ther standis her stale. And thei of Troye riden doun a dale, Til thei mete to-geder bothe; Two hundred thousand schal be wrothe Er thei do parte fro her frende, That schal be sclayn, er thei thennes wende. NOw are thei bothe In the feld arayed, Adhuc bellum In the top right corner, in a very fine hand. . Baneres brode ther ben displayed; On nother side was non so bold That thei ne be-gynne sone to cold, Whan thei schal mete thore: The beste of hem a-bached wore, Saue Ector on that neuere was ferd; He &yogh;eues of hem not a &yogh;erd, Off alle her fare, of thai were mo, For he blan neuere to wende and sclo \u00b6 Alle he myght mete with & ouer-take; He be-gynnes a-boute him to make Wayes to driue In bothe cart & wayn. Many Gregeis other gan frayn: \"How thei my&yogh;t sclo him ther he rode?\" But ther was non that him a-bode: He &yogh;ede doun or lost his lyff. He sclow a thousand In that stryff, When bothe parties to-gedur were; Many a man died there. \u00b6 Ther was gret del to se hem mete, So fele fel doun vndir hors fete, That neuere my&yogh;t afftirward arise, Thei made a schrewed marchaundise: Eche slo other, as thei were wode, Thei made no ruthe of mannes blode; Some is cloven In-to the shere, Some has lorn bothe cheke & ere, Some hath lorn lyuer & gut, Was many man ded doun put, Many hath lorn eye & browe; Euerychon wolde his frend rescowe, Than comes he & he also And girdes his bak euen a-two. And thus ferd thei fro that thei met, Til the sonne was doun set MS. pet . ; Thei blan neuere to smyte ne slo, Many a bak thei made al blo. ECtor fyghtes with his enemys, Thorow here ost he rod thris, Fro man to man a-boute he skyppis, Thei fel afftir him as hit were shepis: For siker, sithe erthe by-gan, Was not made a better man, That so stronge dedes In Armes did; Alas that euere him mys-be-tid! \u00b6 Off man was neuere so moche reuthe, For he was good & loued trewthe; Ther was no man that did suche dedis Off alle the kny&yogh;tes that men of redis, Ther was neuere man his strok my&yogh;t stande, That toke a ful stroke of his hande,\u2014 Saue Achilles that strong kny&yogh;t, For he was man of moche my&yogh;t.\u2014 Ther was no side of al that ost That he ne rode thorow ffor alle her bost. \u00b6 He sclow to grounde al that he toke, The beste of hem for drede quoke, Thei were alle aferd of that on kny&yogh;t, For he was man of moche my&yogh;t. The Gregeis alle his sword knewe, Many a man to grounde he hewe; And tho he bar doun or ouer, Ful ffewe a-&yogh;eyn ne myght couer,\u2014 Vn-til that lyff so sore he smot. The sonne schon bry&yogh;t, the day was hot. \u00b6 Hit greued hem sore of Grece, Thei sat toterynge as it were gece\u2014 What for the strokes & the hete! The Gregeis wel sore he gan bete, He made of hem gret martirdam: I trowe, sithen god made Adam, Dud neuere man so gret meruayles, In fightes fele and gret batayles He sclow so many grete of renoun, Armed with helme and hauberioun, As Ector did his owne hand, The while he was In erthe lyvand. \u00b6 Gret voyce was tho hem among, Swerdis ther on helmes rong, Many an helme was ther clatered, And many hede al to-batered MS. alto batered . . Ector makes of hem grete hepes, Fro man to man a-boute he lepis; As thik as leue on the tre He sles hem doun by two or thre. Thorow the feld hit is wel sene In euery stede ther he hath bene, For it is layd with dede bodies Thikkere than trees ar set In ris. \u00b6 He makes a-boute him roume & way. Achilles wot not what to say, Offte hath he that day him met, But he my&yogh;t neuere his proues bet, Ne he durst not for ferd of gyle Dele with him that ilke whyle, And if he scholde not haue grace, To parte with him out of that place. THe Gregeis saw this fare was nou&yogh;t A-&yogh;eyn the dedis that Ector wrou&yogh;t, Thei my&yogh;t not y-wis lenger endure, Thei swalt almost In her Armure; \u00b6 Hic Greci ffugerunt. Thei fled euerychon, and that was best,\u2014 The sonne was drawen to his rest, And that was fair to here be-houe,\u2014 For thei hadde elles euel proue. The Gregeis fled with michel hast; Wo was hem that was the last,\u2014 Ector sclow hem In that chace. Men my&yogh;t ffolwe hem by the trace Off dede bodyes he lefft ligande, The Gregeis he sclow fleande. \u00b6 Achilles was not then the laste, That he were then he hyed faste; And Ector faste afftir him prikes, He drof him home vn-to his dikes And turned a-&yogh;eyn\u2014for it was ny&yogh;t,\u2014 He fau&yogh;t lenger than he hadde sy&yogh;t: He rod to Troye with his prisonnes And lefft hem In her pauylonnes. ECtor is to Troy riden, Priamus him hath abiden. Off his mete and his sopere, Thei are now set to-geder In-fere, Thei are wel serued with many metis, With murthe & play thei sitte In setis: His fader him makes mochel Ioye, And so did alle that were In Troye. \u00b6 The fader blessed offte his sone; He hadde ther many a benysone Off lordis faire & fre ladyse, Of kny&yogh;tes kene and men of pryse. For ther died mo at that semble, That Ector sclow at that Iorne With his hand\u2014as thei seyde alle\u2014 Then alle that euere fre and thralle. So fele men died then In o day Off no mannes hond\u2014I dar wel say\u2014 In hard batayle that Armed. were, As Ector sclow with his hand there;\u2014 He was wel serued, honourd & kepe. When thei hadde souped, thei wente to slepe And rest hem, til the sonne vp rose: Eche man then to arme him gose, \u00b6 Thei toke her horses & here a-tyre With swerdes gode aboute here swire, And ryden forth vpon a res. &YOGH;it wol thai not be In pes, Ten thousand schal her lyff for-sake, Er thei thenke reste to take. NOw haue thei taken the feld bothe, Ful Irrous & Inly wrothe. Thei are now MS. not . to-geder met, Her speres ar broken, and arwes schet, Thei drowe her swordes of here scauberkes, Ther cleue scheldes & hauberkes, The riche armure thei al to-kerue; Ther schal a thousand er euen sterue: Echon other al to-drawes, Thei cutte In-two bothe lyuer & mawes, \u00b6 Hand & hede, lunge & mylte; Many a gode man was ther spilte. Whil thei hadde day & my&yogh;t out se, Wolde thei neuere In pes be. Thei fau&yogh;t thus clene dayes twelue, Til thei hadde nede here dede men delue, And thei of Grece mouth not ordayn To fyght for-sothe no more sustayn; So were thei ouercomen & taken And with Ector holden waken At the foot of the page are some scribblings upside down. , That thei most rest or elles dye. It was past afftir the Maye, The weder was hot, the sonne schon, The Gregeis made ther-fore gret mone: For thorow ffight and the hete Many on lefft that day the swete. TWelff dayes fau&yogh;t thei to-geder With-outen rest In that hote weder; Be-twene hem died many a lord, Whil thei were at that discord; Many a lord on ayther syde Were ded In tho twelue dayes tyde. The Gregeis my&yogh;t fyght no more, Thei asked trewes with sikyng sore, \u00b6 Off xxx ti dayes thei faire be-sou&yogh;t, Til the dede were In the erthe brou&yogh;t, And til that hete were al doun; For elles hadde thei ben ded echoun: So gret was thanne the hete In feld, Thei my&yogh;t not lyue In tent & teld That wounded were or hurtyng hadde. A, Priamus! that thow was madde, When thow the trewes so ly&yogh;tly graunted! For haddes thow thenne that batayle haunted, Thei schulde haue died with gret vilte, With swerd at that gret mortalite! \u00b6 But ffortune was thi foo mortel And schop thi wo perpetuel; And for sche wolde thi blysse were doun, Sche made the graunte the trewes soun. For sicur I wot with-outen drede: The formast day the trewes out &yogh;ede, That thei to-geder In feld were met, Her blis & Ioye for euere was let. \u00b6 Hic Priamus concedit pacem xxx. dies. PRiamus hath graunted the trewe: The Gregeis maken murthe & glewe, Thei were neuere of trewe so blythe; Thei thanked her god fele sithe, For thei saued hem by her pauste Fro that gret mortalite; Thei maken to him gret offeryng With many broche & many ryng, And thanked hem of here dede, For thei wende efft better spede. \u00b6 Thei were ful fayn thei were at rest, For thei ther-of hadde mychel brest, Thei heled her woundes lesse & more, That woundes haue or any sore. So were thei hole or thritti day, For thenne was the grette hete away, And thei were styff & stout To renne & ride al a-bout, And do al thyng that mister was, Thei dredde not the Troyens a gras. \u00b6 Thritti dayes are now ful-filled, Alas! noble Troye, thow schalt be spilled, Thrawen doun & ligge al wast, For thow schalt lese thi lord In hast! This is the day of thin vnwyn, Alle may wepe that the ben In, Kyng and quene that to the longe; Wele may thow wepe & leue thi songe! Alle Troiens may say: weylaway!

Whi fares thow thus? what ayles the? Whi art thow ferd? what may this be?' 'Alas!' seyde sche, 'my gentil lord!

WHen Andromede saw hir lord go, Lord god! what hir was wo! Sche skrat hir face\u2014as sche were wod\u2014 Til it was ronnen al on blod, Sche rente hir clothes & hir heer tare; Mechel sorwe made sche thare, Sche was almost of hir wit.

The kyng anon with-oute abode To his hors that he on rode, And lepe vp sone with-outen tariyng And rod afftir him with herte sikyng: \u00b6 He priked his hors on the pament, That afftir his feet the fir out glent; For no thyng wolde the kyng abide, Or he sey him where he gan ride. \u00b6 Adhuc Magnum bellum. He rode and toke him by the rayne, And pulled his stede wrothely a-&yogh;ayne, And seyde: 'Ector, thow art to blame!

ECtor offte his fader with-sayd, But he his stede to him brayd, And brou&yogh;t him thanne a-&yogh;eyns his wille, With his praieres, the Cite tille. In the paleys Ector doun lyght, But he wolde not him vndyght \u00b6 Off his armure & his a-tire; He lefft at home with moche ire, That he was not at that sau&yogh;t. The Gregeis with the Troyens fau&yogh;t With hardi herte and gret reddure: Ther was be-twene hem a grisly stoure, Many a kny&yogh;t on grounde ther lay, And many an hors ther wente a-way,\u2014 Her guttes trayled on the grounde,\u2014 That neuere afftir her maystres founde. \u00b6 Troylus woundes Gregeis and sles, And he by-holdes wel Diomedes, He hadde to him wel gret envy: He thought to do with him Maystry,\u2014 That him were leuere then gret catel,\u2014 That he myght scle him In that batel; He hated him for his lemman, Cresseida Cress , possibly by same hand, on erasure. , that fair womman. He toke a spere stalworth and strong, To bere doun Troyle a-mong the throng; But Troyle saw him come ridande And toke a stalworth spere In hande, And rode to him with my&yogh;t and mayn, [And Diomedes him a&yogh;eyn,] No gap in MS. That thei fel bothe opon the grene: And toke here stedis as kny&yogh;tes kene, \u00b6 And bothe her swordis out thei drow And ffau&yogh;t to-geder long y-now, Til thei were stoned hede and brayn. That on that other wolde haue sclayn, Ne hadde than comen Menelaus With al his ost opon Troylus; For he come thenne with gret meyne And made these kny&yogh;tes departye. And elles I trowe with-outen les Troyle hadde sclayn Diomedes! MEnelaus is comen doun With many kny&yogh;t and bold baroun: When his men with here Ioyned, Many a man was ther assoyned Off ther lyff ther at her mote, That neuere afftirward come to bote. \u00b6 When Menelaus was In that presse, He saw a kyng\u2014het Messeres,\u2014 He smot that kyng vpon the scheld, That he fel doun opon the feld. When the Gregeis saw him falle, Thei gadered a-boute him alle: \u00b6 Messeres wolde defende his cors, But sicurly he hadde no fors; Thei made a serkel al a-boute, That he my&yogh;t not go with-oute. Thei toke that kyng a-mong hem a-none And with him gan a-wey gone, To lede him to here pauylouns And put him with ther other prisouns. But Troyle by-gan theder to loke And say, how thay of Grece him toke: He vowed to god, \"he scholde be wo, Or thei that kyng with hem lete go.\" \u00b6 He rode thedir with-oute dwellyng And be-lan neuere of men fellyng, Til he hadde take him fro her hondis And delyuered him out of his bondis. The Gregeis saw that thei mow&yogh;t nou&yogh;t Lede him a-way, as thei hadde thou&yogh;t: Thei thoght his hede of for to strike And leue him liggand vpon the dike, \u00b6 But come Troyle, the dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t, And many of hem sclow In here fy&yogh;t And made that kyng a-way to scape For al that ost & alle that frape; Then MS. But then. were Troyens bold and Ioyus. But than come doun Thelamanyus With thre thousand of dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;tes, To helpe Gregeis with al her my&yogh;tes; On that side come he doun ridande, Ther Polidomas was ffyghtande. \u00b6 Thelamanyus with a spere To Polidomas rode with were And bar him doun, er he was war, And with that Iustus he smot him sar And threw him doun ouer his hors ers, That long afftirward he was the wers. He was In poynt tho him to &yogh;elde, But then come Troyle to that felde And Thelamon my&yogh;tily assayled And so hertly on him trauayled, That on hors brou&yogh;t he Polidomas Swyfliche as he rather was. PAris hath his men araied, His baner is before disp[l]ayed, He gaderes his men aboute him nowe And biddis that thei schal him folowe: To that assaut wil he now wende, His men echon her bowes thei bende, And sette In takel long and brode; To that assaut thei with him rode And schotte Gregeis & did him skathe. But Achilles was al to rathe,\u2014 Armed wel & redi dight,\u2014 To come then with many a kny&yogh;t: With al his ost come he doun tho, The Troiens faste be-gan to sclo. \u00b6 He hem sles & doun hem kest, Scheldes ryued, & helmes berst; His men were euere more him ner And halp him wel at his mestier: Thei leyd on Troiens strokes large, And so thei gan hem ouer-charge With stalworth strokes of her hand, That thei my&yogh;t no lenger stand. \u00b6 The Troiens thanne be-gan to fle, Faste ridande to here Cite, As faste as thei myght prike; Thei spared nother doun ne dike, Til thei come at here cite &yogh;ates. Achilles folwed hem algates Ouer dales & ouer dounes With his Gregeis & Murmidounes; He sclow of hem that tyme gret won, Thei fled a-way fro him echon. This line in red paint at this very place. Hic Achilles occidit Margariton filius [ sic !] Regis Troiani. THe kynges sone Margariton Saw he come hem vpon, And sclow his men\u2014as lyoun bestis That is for-hungred In wilde forestis;\u2014 He my&yogh;t him no lenger suffer In no wyse For al the gode that was In prise: He turned his stede vn-to him son, To fyght with him was he bon, He smot vnto him strokes thore As breme as any bore. \u00b6 He made Achilles leue his chace, That he no lenger mordur mace; Off his chasyng he him restayed: Many a strok ther was payed, He lent him fele and him qwyt; But Margaritoun was so hit, Er he partid fro his handes, That he fel ded vpon the sandis. The Troiens made an hidous cri, When he was ded so sodanly. The dou&yogh;ti Thelamanyus To hem of Troye was envious, He chased the Troiens & thret And many of hem to grounde bet. \u00b6 But Paris harde his men defendis, Many an arwe he hem sendis; But for au&yogh;t that he my&yogh;t do, And al his ost with also, Thei were put vnto fly&yogh;t, Wenkyst foule, & discomfi&yogh;t.

To saue her lyues for thei hadde nede,\u2014 And brou&yogh;t with hem that ded body, And &yogh;ede ther-with by strete & sty, Til thei come at Ilion And leyde ther doun Margariton Vpon the grounde al bledande: Many on for him was wepande. ECtor saw his brother slayn,\u2014 And for him wepes kny&yogh;t & swayn,\u2014 His colour chaunged, his herte ros, For tene Ector he wode gos: He rolled his eyen as best ramage, As he hadde fallen In a rage; He lased his helme & toke his stede, 'Tel me,' he sayde, 'who dede that dede? \u00b6 What is he that my brother sclow? I schal him venge, if I mow!' Thei seide: 'it was sir Achilles That sclow him with-oute les, And put vs to discomfiture, For we my&yogh;t him not endure; A-&yogh;eyn him may we make no defence With-oute &yogh;oure help & &yogh;oure presence.' \u00b6 Ector thanne with wrothful herte Vpon his hors lepe vp smerte, He strok his stede so with his spores That he lepe ouer lond & forwes; He spared no ston ne cause, Til he mette with his meyne. \u00b6 Right at the &yogh;atis met he his men, Fleande be twelue & ten; To hem wold he speke wordis non, But to his enemys &yogh;ede he alon: His fomen were sone of him dred, And thei wex bold that furst were fled, \u00b6 Hic Ector ibat ad prelium. For whan thei hadde of him a syght, Thei were not ferd of kyng ne kny&yogh;t. ECtor is of Troye y-went, He brak his fader comaundement, He thoght not on his benysoun That dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;t of gret renoun: He schal lese his lyff or euen MS. euel. -tyde, A&yogh;eyn to Troie schal he not ride. With his lyff hit rewes me sore, That he that day come thore! \u00b6 Allas! that day he hadde no grace To be at home, as him radde wace; But sicurly he myght not fle On no manere his destane: His ffader wist not of his wendyng, He &yogh;ede ther-fore to his endyng. He sclow Gregeis and kest hem doun And droff hem alle out of the toun; \u00b6 The rayn fel neuere so thike on rise As Ector sclow his enemys; Was non so stiff hem among That he ne sclow hem or doun sclong, That he my&yogh;t take or ouer-reche. Off Margaritoun toke he wreche, He venged him with dynt of sword, He sclow that day many a lord. Alle that feld was vmbesprade Off dede kny&yogh;tes that lay & bledde: For sicurly he was so wroth, That wham he hit to dethe he goth; \u00b6 Among Gregeis he rayked, treled, With his swerd that wel was steled, Was non so strong that him sittis The strong strokes that he hem hittis. He sclow alle tho & fellde MS. fell do. ri&yogh;t With dynt of sword that he reche my&yogh;t. \u00b6 Achilles then, that lordly sire, Wolde not abide him In his Ire, But euere [held] fro him alone, Euere til Ector were gone. Hadde he a-biden him In his wratthe, He scholde haue had an euel batthe, He scholde haue bathed In his blode. Was none so strong that him with-stode, That he ne lay ded vpon the sondes With stalworth strokes of his hondes. If a man hadde with him ben A-mong Troiens, and hadde sen Alle the meruayles that he wrou&yogh;t, He wolde euere haue In his thou&yogh;t Off his endyng and his myschaunce, And of his foule encombraunce As he hadde of his lyue. He sclow of hem hundres fyue And ten ther-to MS. &yogh;er to. , er he wolde sese; He droff a-&yogh;eyn-ward alle the prese, He droff hem alle a-&yogh;eyn bacward For drede of dethe her tentis toward. ECtor fightes vpon that hethe, Many a man doth he to dethe: Was non so bold that durst him mete, That he ne fel doun In the strete; He deled a-boute him euel knockis, Her armure ferde as it were frockis. Al that euere stode In his way He felde hem doun as clottis of clay, He smot a man som-tyme on-two, And som-tyme man & hors also; He sclow and wounded &yogh;ong and olde, A&yogh;eyn his strok my&yogh;t no stel holde. \u00b6 Hit was a wonder for to se, What men he sclow at that Iorne; To se the syght hit was delful, How euery plud of blod stode ful MS. stodeful. Off men that he ther slees & felles, The blod ran doun as water of welles. \u00b6 He barst her mayles and al to-tatred, The scheldis of hem he al to-clatered. Thei knewe wel sone that it was he, And fro his strokes gan [t]he[i] fle; He sclow of hem many a score. His men that were y-fled MS. yfeld. be-fore, He turned a-&yogh;eyn In that assaut, And bitterly with hem he faut. ADou&yogh;ti duke, Euripolus, An[d] an other, Hastidius, He saw how Ector scheldes roff And al that ost a-&yogh;eyn-ward droff: He ffau&yogh;t his on a-&yogh;eyn alle, He sclow her men and made hem falle, The blod of men a-boute him flowed. Vnto her goddis thei bothe a-vowed \"For al his fare he scholde be b altered from h. met, And of his dedis he scholde be let.\" \u00b6 When these dukes hadde bothe y-sworn, With alle her men thei wente be-forn And layd opon him strokes faste, And al a-boute him thei be-caste. But I wot neuere, what it a-vayled? For whan he was with hem assayled, He sclow hem bothe In-myddes the ost For al here Iangelynge and her bost; And many an-other moder sone He brak of bothe the scheltrone: Thei fled a-way as thei my&yogh;t go,\u2014 For thei saw he MS. he saw thei. wolde hem MS. him. slo,\u2014 Thei durst therfore no lenger dwelle, But fled fro him\u2014the sothe to telle. \u00b6 The stoure was gret and perilous, The noyse was gret & hidous: Troiens were than a-&yogh;eyn turned, That furst for drede her fomen scorned; Opon her foos &yogh;ede thei hedelynge And wounded sore bothe kny&yogh;tes & kynge. But thei of Grece Polidomas toke And faste a-weyward with him schoke, \u00b6 Thei wende haue had him prisoner, But thei be-fel foule encomber MS. encombranser. The scribe first wrote encombranse , and then forgot to strike out the rans , when he altered it to encomber ; cf. l. 1617. Off his takyng & his ledyng: Thei my&yogh;t him not to her tentis bryng, As thei wende to haue y-done, For Ector come to hem sone. \u00b6 Whan he was war of his takyng, He come to him faste schakyng; Among that hepe strok he his stede Polidomas that then wolde lede, And dalt ther strokes on eche a side To his fomen that were vnride. He bar here feet ouer thaire hede, Many of hem did he to dede; He sclow that tyme two hundred & mo With his hond for-sothe tho. POlidomas that thenne led, Thei lete him go, and fro him fled. He made a-mong hem suche debate, That thei were ferd of him & mate; Thei lete go quyte Polidomas, And seide euerychon that while 'alas!' Hem Angered sore, whan he was tan. For he was two hundred mennes ban Or it was passed myd-ouer-none; Hadde him last lyff, he hadde for-done The Gregeis alle with-oute lye, But he most nede that day dye; For destane ches his chaunce so, That he most nede that day go to, That day forsothe, or it were euen\u2014 As Andromede saw In here sweuen. \u00b6 Herkenes! as &yogh;e schal here, How he died & In what manere: For ther byfore long y-gon He fau&yogh;t with Gregeis many on, He fau&yogh;t somtyme with ten thousand, &YOGH;it my&yogh;t thei not his strokes with-stand; Was non so strong on Gregeis side, That durst him In his yre a-byde. Achilles met neuere with him &yogh;it, That he ne &yogh;af him an euel fit; For al his my&yogh;t & his prowes He partied neuere fro him harmles, That he ne was wounded & euel dyght For all that he was so hardy a knyght. ECtor hath quyt Polidomas And brou&yogh;t him out of al that cas, He rightes his helm & wele amendes, And to his meyne he him sendes, And askes of hem: \"whether that thei slepe, Whi thei the lord no better kepe?\" \u00b6 He turned him then to hem of Grece And hewes her bodies al to pece; Thei falle afftir him as doth the leues In wynter-tyme that growes on greues; He layde hem doun alle be-dene And made the way of hem ful clene. Ther my&yogh;t non stande that he smot; The Gregeis made a sore lot And seyde: \"but god did bote, Thei were euerychon vndir his fote.\" \u00b6 Ther was o Grece an Ameral, That saw how Ector wrou&yogh;t bale A-mong Gregeis, how he hem &yogh;eled, And with his swerd he hem steked: He felde hem doun as hadde ben tres. The duk men cleped Leochynes; Him thoght for sorwe his herte bledis, Ful faste to Ector he him spedis And stroke him with al his my&yogh;t, For he him fond In suche a ply&yogh;t That he wende for-sothe certayn That he scholde him haue sclayn. \u00b6 But hit was noght as he supposed, Thow he were duk & kny&yogh;t a-losed, Thow he were duk & kny&yogh;t a-pert And fond him thenne at discouert: He sclow him not, but hurt him so That helm & coyfe cleue In-two, And carf of him bothe heer & hide, And &yogh;aff Ector a wounde vnride. \u00b6 But Ector stille on his hors sat, That he fel not to grounde with that; But whan he felte that he was smetyn,\u2014 As men fynde of him y-wreten,\u2014 He was so wroth, & wex ner wode, That he of him hadde so rau&yogh;t blode: \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit leochiden. \u00b6 Then he smot him vpon the hede, That he ete neuere afftir brede; He smot him vpon his croune, That to his hors he cleue him doune; He cleue him euen in-two amyddes\u2014 'Go on deblis Cf. note to l. 10027, p. 296. !' he him biddes, 'Ho made the,' he sayde, 'so bold To smyte me thus, and not me told?' \u00b6 The duk hade of him suche houselle, On bothe the sides his hors he felle; As he hadde ben a clouen hogge, The duke hanged as a frogge. For wratthe & tene that Ector was hirt, Many ffro her lyues sterst; He made suche hepes of dede bodies Off dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;tes that were of pris, That non durst him than a-byde Ne In his way not ones ryde. AChilles houes euere atrayn And saw what lordes he hadde sclayn, Lordes and kny&yogh;tes In his wodnesse, Mo then he coude nombre or gesse. Achilles than In his herte thoght: \"But if Ector were to dethe broght Hastily with som qweyntyse, Or scleght, by som skynnes wyse, The Gregeis scholde neuere day y-se That thei of Troye schuld Maystered be; For no strengthe my&yogh;t a-vayle, For nou&yogh;t that he coude assayle.\" He ceste therfore In his wit, How thei my&yogh;t of him be qwit With som quayntyse that he my&yogh;t do, That he were the deth sone brou&yogh;t to. Many a sleght & many a compas Achilles In his hert cast, How he my&yogh;t Ector ful-fille His strong compas & alle his wille. Whil Achilles him be-thoght How Ector scholde to dethe be brou&yogh;t, \u00b6 Ector saw a duk ridande Among that prese with sword In hande, He felde Troiens In many stedes, And on her bodies rides & tredes. The duk was cleped Polynetes, He come thedir for Achilles At him his sustur for to craue, For he wolde hir to his wiff haue; \u00b6 He was a man of moche hauyng, Ther was non richer kny&yogh;t ne kyng A-mong hem alle In that route Then was that duk with-oute doute; Fro the ferthest side of Inde Come he thedir, so was he kynde To Achilles for his suster sake, For he wolde hir haue to his make. As he rode thus a-boute r[a]ykande, With hem of Troye thus laykande, He met Ector right In his way; That Angred him sone\u2014I dar wel say: Ector saw how that he sclow His men of Troye wel y-now, He felde hem doun & hurt hem ofte: He spake to him nother loude ne soffte, \u00b6 He layd at him with gret dispite, He asked not ones what he hite, But lete a strok to him fle Opon his hed a-bouen his eye; \u00b6 Hic Ector occidit Polyneten. He cleue his helm & scheld eke, He cleue him doun In-to the breke. The Gregeis than be-gan to daren, When thei the duk say so faren; Ther were none armes that him with-stode,\u2014 Were thei maked neuere so gode,\u2014 A-&yogh;eyn the strok that he smot, That thei [ne brast] a-none fot hot. \u00b6 Thei seyde: \"he was the deuel of helle, And thei were foles ther lengur to dwelle, A&yogh;eyn him fight lengur to holde; Ne were thei kny&yogh;tes neuere so bolde\"\u2014 'He cleues oure men as him-self lykes, He kylles oure men & to dethe strikes.' Thei seyde: \"the deuel of helle pit! Out of here land myght thei not flit, A&yogh;eyn Ector batayle to rayse, So wele as thei were alle at ayse At home vche-on on over line, but by the same hand.

W Hat . duk was clouen In two parties, On eyther halff his hors he lyes; Hit was ruthe se how he honged, A-boute the sadel the hors him flonged, Til he him ouer his sadel cast Vndir hors feet at the last. \u00b6 To se that duke was it lothely; Achilles loked then wrothely Vpon Ector with-outen les, For he hadde sclayn Polynetes. He swere \"he scholde venge that kny&yogh;t, If his god wolde, with al his my&yogh;t.\" \u00b6 Achilles than to Ector rennes,\u2014 As lyoun doth out of her dennes, When thei are hungred, afftir bestes That thei se walke In wilde forestes:\u2014 He wende haue smeten Ector sore; But he was hurt, or he come thore, For Ector was war of him wel, He wiste his purpos euery del, He wiste wel al that he ment. A darte to him Ector sent, And at Achilles he it threw, That he hit wele, he knew; Thorow his scheld a dart he droff, That scheld and hauberk al to-roff; Thorow his Aketoun & his hide He smot him eueli thorow his side. \u00b6 Achilles saw that he was hurt, Off his purpos was he lurt; He saw he hadde euere the werre, He held his hors & wolde no ferre, But rod him to his Pauyloun, And kest of helme and aketoun, And bond his hed & wel stopped; His herte for Anger ffaste hopped, That he toke of him suche dispit. He byndes his woundes & wel dit Cf. note to ll. 2303-4. , And kest vpon him newe a-tire, And rides a-&yogh;eyn In mochel Ire And thenkes that he schal Ector sclo, Thoow he ther to dethe go. AChilles now his stede be-strides, To fight a-&yogh;eyn faste he rides; His wounde is wel & wisly boundoun, He MS. To. take a spere was kyndely groundoun. The spere was tow & long, Gret, & styff, & wonder strong, Off two thousand was hit the best, For it scholde not on him berst By no manere In his strikynge, Hit was a spere at his lykynge; He thouthe to sle Ector with-al\u2014 Alas the while! for he so schal! ECtor rides & raykes a-boute, Off no man hadde he no doute, Off no mannes pride he ne thou&yogh;te, Off no mannes leuyng told he nou&yogh;t, To kyng ne kny&yogh;t &yogh;aff he no tent; That gode body ther-fore was schent, He fau&yogh;t euere-more In one, He leues stondyng be-fore him none, He is to hem an euel gest, He fightes euere with-outen rest: He sclow two thousand, er he be-lan; Thei seyde he was non erthely man. \u00b6 Ther was a duk of gret astate, A&yogh;eyn Ector held debate, Among Troiens faste he skayred, And hurt him sore, & euel hem payed. Ector loked toward that duke And saw his men of him rebuke, He hied him thedur with mychel hast, And quyk be-gan him for to cast: \u00b6 Ector him droff so with his my&yogh;t, That he defende him ne my&yogh;t, He &yogh;eld his swerd & his knyff And bad Ector saue his lyff. And Ector sayde: \"he wolde him saue, But he wolde him prisoner haue.\" \u00b6 Hic Achilles occidit Ectorem. \u00b6 Ector was thanne faste a-boute Off that prece to haue him oute MS. sute . ; But men stode so on euery a side, That he my&yogh;t not out with him ride: To haue him out was he not ethe, He put his swerd In his schethe, He kest his scheld on his bak, To saue the kyng fro alle his pak; To other &yogh;af he no tent, But he were with-oute, as he hadde ment. AChilles held him euere a-rome, And saw that Ector &yogh;aff no gome To no man thenne but for to bryng Out of that prece that riche kyng: He hadde that tyme no spere In hand Ther-with to dere no man lyuand, His swerd was put In his skauberke, He was al bare but his hauberke On his brest & his stomak, His scheld was casten on his bak. \u00b6 Achilles ther-to toke good hede And thoght, \"but he that tyme spede, That he scholde neuere to dethe him do, But he my&yogh;t that tyme come ther-to.\" He stroke his stede & helde him faste, And to[k] his spere that wel wolde laste, And rod to him, er he were war, And thorow the bodi he him bar: \u00b6 Thorow the bodi he him thrist, Er he were war & er he wyst; He bar him doun vpon the grounde Fro his hors with dethes wounde. ODemon saw Ector was dede, He saw his blod aboute sprede; The deth of him sore he rewed. Whan that he saw he not remeued, Whan he saw him ligge so In pees, He stale be-hynde Achilles And smot him with a pollax sore, That of his hors he fel thore: He fel ouer his sadel bowe And lay In swoun a long throwe. And Odemoun flees a-weyward faste, Many a dart thei afftir him caste; To the Troyens he gan him spede, That was his best, for he hadde nede. \u00b6 Thei toke Achilles of that throng, That he died not here hors a-mong, And layde him soffte vpon his scheld And lad him hom to his teld; And he my&yogh;t nother ride ne go, So was he sore smyten tho. And thei of Troye Ector out drow For drede of hors, with sorwe y-now, And lad him hom to his paleis. And thus died Ector\u2014as Dares sais. \u00b6 That batayle that day thus gan to ende, Bothe the ostes hamward gan wende: Thei of Grece with Achilles, Ioyful and glad for his res; And thei of Troie with Ector the gode, Al ded In his owne blode. LOrd, the Ioye that Gregeis made! Thei ete & drank & made him glade With pipes & daunces & Iolyffte; Gret Ioye it was her murthe to se.

And thonked here godis In that place That hadde sent hem som grace, To scle him that hadde hem most anoyed And her Gregeis so foule distroied. NOw is he ded, that gode kny&yogh;t, That no man my&yogh;t with-stande In fight! Now is sclay[n] that gode body That men tolde so moche by! That was so moche with alle men dred, Now liggis he ded and for-bled! In Troie was neuere so gode kny&yogh;t born, As thei of Troie hadde than for-lorn!

Off massi gold that were y-bet Were grauen ther with leues diuerse: Al can I not reherse,\u2014 But ther was corue & semeli schorn The leues of Oke & of hawethorn, The louely leues of the vyne, And many then I can not devyne: \u00b6 The vyne-braunche with alle here grapes, And many other skynnes Iapes, Many a pomel wel enbosed, Hit was wroght & wel engrosed With ffloures & leues wel en-leued. Now haue I MS. I. In . this werk discreued, Off that tabernacle that riche bothe; Now wol I telle &yogh;ow al the sothe, How it was dight wel & fair, That he myght neuere rote ne pair: WHen thei haue maked this al,\u2014 This Tabernacle that was rial,\u2014 Off gold made thei a riche cheyere And sette it In that faire celere, The tabernacle stode hit y-myd, And gode Ector ther-In thei did. Ector sat vpon that dese As he hadde lyued\u2014with-oute les,\u2014 He sat pertly bolde vp-right As man that hadde ben In his myght; So priueli was he ther tyed, That he toward no syde wryed. He hadde vpon him his garnement That he In erthe on lyue [In] went, In his owne clothes was he clad\u2014 For Priamus the kyng so bad. BVt herkenes now her ordinaunce: What was the Maystres puruyaunce, What was her sleyght and her cure, That thei MS. thei thei . him saued with-oute blemure Off fflesch or bon, of hyde or hewe, But held him euere y-liche newe? Thei made an hole In his haterel & set MS. Y set . ther-In a fair vessel That was ful of riche bavme,\u2014 The some ther-of can I not avme;\u2014 And other thyng ther was with melled, That was noble & wel smelled. Hit ran so doun to his foreheued, That no colour him was by-reued; For thanne ran it doun to his eyen And saued the liddis and [the] brien MS. vrien , distinctly. , And so be-gan him for to lese Vnto his thrillis of his nese; And afftirward faste it sekes, Til it come doun to his chekes, And kepes his gomes & rennes so lite MS. solite . , And his tethe makes faire & white, And al the face with the her Was hole and sound, whil he sette ther. That licour ran so to his hals, To his scholdres and his brest als; \u00b6 Ther is no Ioynt aboute his tharmes, It rennes so doun by his Armes, And by his hond it so doun wendes, Til it come at his ffyngur endes. And gret ffusoun ther doun rides Ful wonderly by bothe his sydes, So ffaste that licour dounward droppes, That no thyng his rennyng stoppes, Til it were comen In-to his theis And so &yogh;ede doun In-to his kneis; So it ran wonder schete, Til it come doun to his fete. \u00b6 Another vessel thenne ther stode, Ful of baume ffresche MS. ff'resche . & gode, And kest vpward his gode reles And keped him so In flesche & gres. That on &yogh;ede vp, that other doun, Fro his ffete to the croun; When it aboue with that was met, Bothe his feet ther-Inne was set. Thei &yogh;aff In him suche odour, That he was saff with-oute sauour: Thus thei him made with here my&yogh;t And keped him bothe day & ny&yogh;t. WHen this werk was thus be-went, Thei made foure morteres \u00feat euere brent; Thei brenned nyght, thei brenned day, With-outen sese thei brenned ay. Thei were alle mad of gold schire, On hem stode euere a flaume of fire, That neyther water of broke ne of bek Ne nothyng In erthe thei my&yogh;t slek. Thei made afftir a parclos That al a-boute that fair werk gos, With Gemewes folden on euery a side That bothe my&yogh;t spere and open wyde, That Ector schewed & seen my&yogh;t be To euery man that him wolde se. NOw of Ector lete we be, And of Achilles speke we! Off that strong knyght\u2014as I sayde, How Gregeis In his bed him layde; His woundes greues him so sore, That al his my&yogh;t hath he for-lore; He may wel euel ete or drynke, Off merthe ne play may he non thinke. \u00b6 His grete woundes him greues sore, That he dredde to lyue no more. The leches him comfortes wonder wele And leues that he lyue schele, And makes him couere more & more And by her power heled his sore, So that he may somdel ete And haue sauour vnto his mete. AGamenon the Emperour Sendes Messanger & corour, That thei scholde bidde the kynges alle To MS. And . speke with him In his halle, And alle the lordes grete & smale To holde a counsel generale. \u00b6 The Messangeres also swythe Thei fond the lordes glad and blithe Off Ector and his myschaunce,\u2014 Thei were so fayn of his lyueraunce,\u2014 The Messageres bad alle & some: \"To Agamenon thei scholde come; \u00b6 Hic Greci tenuerunt consilium. Schold non be-leue that corovne beres, Ne sercle of gold that on hede weres, That thei ne schul come to his hale, Kyng & duk and Amerale.\" AGamenoun ful hendeli Kepis hem alle ful curtaysli, And did hem sitte more and lesse, Euerychon afftir his state[l]i[ne]sse. Agamenoun the Emperour Spake to him with honour, He sette his speche fair & hende And seyde: 'lordynges, my dere frende, Wel au&yogh;t vs to glorifie Oure goddis that &yogh;euen vs the Maystrie Off oure enemy that we haue sclayn; Ther-of we ben alle fayn And gret worschepe & honour do, For elles hadde we neuere comen ther-to, \u00b6 Whil he hadde leued, to oure purpos. But now may we wel suppos, Sithen he is ded that hem defende, That thei haue alle theire endyng ende, And we schal lordis & maystres be Off here godis & here Cite. For whil he leued, my&yogh;t we not spede, So was he dou&yogh;ti In his dede; Vs my&yogh;t no grace for him by-falle, For he on vndid vs alle. \u00b6 We hadde no let but him alone, But now is he ded & from vs gone, We schal that Cite lyghtly wynne And alle that ben hit with-Inne; For thei are now of no power To kepe hem fro oure daunger, Sithen he is ded & fro hem went That vs al day so foule schent. It is to vs wel more a-vauntage That he is ded & loken In cage, Then we hadde sclayn In fight felle Halff the men that with him dwelle. \u00b6 For he sclow mo him-selff alone Then alle that other did euerychone, And we ben now\u2014I vnderstande\u2014 Mo then sixti ti over the line, inserted by another hand. hundred thousande Off Mennes bodies gode and able, That ben a-pert and defendable. THe dedis of Ector ben wide y-kyd, That thei may not wel be hid: How fele kynges sclow he of oure With his my&yogh;t & his vigoure! How he sclow In his reuery The dou&yogh;ti kyng Prothesaly! \u00b6 Patrodus also, Achilles cosyn, In his strengthe sclow he him! \u00b6 How sclow he In his gret Ire Kyng Mennon, that lordly sire! We were echon of him a-dred. How sclow he the gode kyng Ced! So did he kyng Polenete. He fond no man that to him was mete. He sclow also kyng Alphynor, And so he did kyng Prouenor That was a kyng of gret genterie, Off dou&yogh;tines and chiualrie. \u00b6 How sclow he with his force The myghti kyng of dou&yogh;ti Corce! He died with dynt: so he gart The noble kyng Pilo&yogh;enart. \u00b6 He sclow also the kyng Yside. No man durst him a-byde. He did also to dethe sone The dou&yogh;ti kyng Letabone. Ne sclow he not the kyng Humere? I wist neuere man that was his pere. \u00b6 He sclow oure kyng Archilogus, And the kyng also Episcropus; And so he did kyng Archomene, And the hardy kyng Palymene. Ne sclow he not the kyng Antipe? And so he did kyng Sanxipe. \u00b6 He did vs moche sorwe and tene: He sclow the gode kyng Philoxene; He smot to dethe vndir his fete The noble kyng Polibete, Kyng Phiebete, and kyng Leankes, Alle he sclow oure gret vnthankes, He smot her bodyes euen In-two; So did he other mo also. We au&yogh;t wele his bodi wary! \u00b6 He sclow kyng Fume & kyng Dary, And Many duk and Amerelles; He sclow oure lordes & robbed oure halles, And bar a-wey coffre & chest. He that him sclow mot be blest! For now\u2014I hope\u2014he is ded That did vs schame and qued, That oure men so foule sclow, And we hem alle schal Maystre now With-Inne a while at oure wille. But herkenes now! this is my skylle: \u00b6 Thoow it be so that he be slayn, Hap of ffyght is no certayn; n is struck out after ma. \u00b6 No man wot how it schal schape, Who schal dye & who schal skape. Wherfore I say: sithe it so is That by Achilles dou&yogh;tines We are now brou&yogh;t to oure aboue, Me thinke it were to oure behoue That we In feld fight no more, Vn-til Achilles heled wore; For we ar noght alle sure & sekir With-oute him to wynne this bekir. With-oute him & his pouste In certayn hope we may not be To haue of hem the victorie, Thoow thei for Ector be sorie. \u00b6 Wherfore this is my menyng: That it were good, at my wetyng, That we sende by kyng or kny&yogh;t To Priamus, to aske respit, That we .viij. wekes the pees may haunte, If thei the trewes so longe wol graunte, And the dedes were enseled. By than may Achilles be heled, And we may make oure-self clene Off sore woundes that doth vs tene.' WHen Agamenoun thus hadde sayd, The lordis were alle wel a-payd: Thei held his conseyl good & lele, To haue the pees til he hadde hele; Thei held it alle wel y-do, Thei graunted echon his conseyl to; This lordes alle &yogh;aue ther assent To his counseyl & Iugement: That with-oute him and his absence Wold thei not fight in ther presence. \u00b6 Hic Greci pecierunt pacem Troianorum MS.

Saue the kyng Palamides\u2014 He was neuere no tyme In pes, He playned him of his Emperour That was her alther gouernour, And seyde: \"he was not worthi To haue of hem suche seruageri; Ther were other better then he To haue forsothe that dignite.\" \u00b6 Vpon a day it so befel: Agamenoun\u2014the sothe to tel\u2014 Hadde sent afftir the lordes alle \"Thei scholde come In-to his halle\"; And as thei sete at most spekyng \"How thei scholde to ende bryng Ther purpos & her gode espleyt,\" Palamides be-thou&yogh;t him streyt To put him out of his office: And ther-of did he as the vn-wyse. \u00b6 Hit was a&yogh;eyn his genterie To haue to him so foule envye With-oute disert MS. dishert. or any mysdede; But not-for-thi so longe he &yogh;ede: At the laste was he remeued, And another mad & newed. PAlamydes as he sat there, Off his spekyng coude blynne neuere, To Agamenoun offte he flote And made to him wordes hote; He seyde: \"it was a-&yogh;eyn resoun That he hadde ben alle sesoun So longe vndir his gouernayle; Ther were other that coude more a-vayle And were more profitable, For he was not\u2014he sayde\u2014able Suche a state to reioye.\" Agamenoun sat wel stille & coye, When he hadde sayd his gret gole; Agamenoun ful entempre Answered him soburly,\u2014 For he was euere wis & sly,\u2014 \u00b6 He seyde: 'Palamides, I haue gret wondir thow can not sese Off thi wordes & thi carpyng, Whan we be thus In oure gaderyng.

THese lordes were alle gretly dered, Ther was non that answered; But bad hem: \"be In pees bothe, For thei wold not that thei were wrothe\"; Thei bad hem alle: \"thei scholde not greue,\" And ros vp alle and toke here leue; Thei wente alle hamward MS. hamward. sone, Off that was ther no more to done.

Her-of spake the Murmidones And told this tydynges to Achilles Off that newe lord Palamydes: \"How he was chosen here alther lord By the lordis comune acorde.\" When Achilles herde this tydandis, Out of his bed sclong he his handes, As he that was euel payde Off these tythandis that him were sayde; His woundes bledde for-sothe & brake. With so gret herte Achilles spak To alle that stode aboute his bed, And seyde: \"that this was euel y-red To make among hem suche a chaunge\"\u2014 'Now hope I that alle thei caunge! \u00b6 For of vs alle\u2014so mot I the!\u2014 Was ther non so wys as he, Ne non that coude so lede oure ost With witt and skylle, with-outen bost.

Many dede bodies lay ther on grounde And lite went ther hole & sounde; \u00b6 For hadde thei had lyght of sonne, The Gregeis the pase thenne had wonne. But thei departed for faute of lyght And riden home with al her myght; The Troiens riden to the toun, And the Gregeis to ther pauyloun. THe Troiens now her sorwe reherse For the kynges deth of Perse: Ther was non that longed to Troie, Kyng ne kny&yogh;t, sqwyer ne boye, That thei [ne] made gret del & sorwe Bothe an euen and on morwe. Was non that made such wayment As did Paris verament: He sorwed day & also nyght, For he him loued with al his myght. \u00b6 This was ther-fore Paris rede: \"To boyle him and put him In lede, And lede him hom to his contre With taper & torche & gret rialte, With gret plente of fele candeles; That he myght haue his burieles And ligge among his antecessoures, The riche kynges, his predecessoures, And be ther grauen honorably By-fore his sones that dwelles ther-by, \u00b6 Hic pecierunt pacem ad inuicem per magnum tempus. In his londis that kynges schal be Afftir him In gret pouste.\" NIght is comen, & day is gon, The[i] gon to bedde & slepen euerychon. On morwe when it was day lyght, The sonne was resen & schon bryght, Kyng Priamus sente doun his sonde To alle the Gregeis liggand on the stronde, To Aske the trues\u2014as Dares sais\u2014 A certeyn tyme to ben In pais. But it is In his bokes wane How longe the trues were tane; How long that thei schold holde, Dites ne Dares non ther tolde. But thei haue graunt & surte founden This line on erasure, but by the same hand. , Many a rop was thanne vn-wounden, Many a cope & many an hode That were praysed worthe mechel gode, Off gold, of silk, and som of say, For then was Ector put a-way, That thei scholde holde riche festis\u2014 As I fynde In here gestes. NOw Ector Menyng-day schal be holden: In Troye bene robis riche vnfolden That were layd vp be-fore the dayes, With silke y-filed and riche arais, And other newe lordis did make For honour of that festis sake. Thorow the toun was hit done cry: \"That riche & poure, lowe & hy, That euere longed In-to Troye, Off ffyftene dayes schuld make no ioye, But lyue In wepyng & gret sorwe The .xv. dayes euen & morwe, With-oute karole, with-oute daunce, In gode Ector remembraunce.\" \u00b6 In his remembraunce & his mynde Ther was that heuynesse\u2014as I fynde\u2014 Off Priamus and of riche kynges And of other grete lordynges;\u2014 \"And whan the ffyfftene dayes of wo Were fulfilled and a-go, Thei scholde make rialte, Mechel daunce & mechel gle.\" THe while the festes thus endured, And eueryche were to other ensured, Thei of Troye hadde here comyng To hem of Grece & here spekyng; And Gregeis come In-to the toun And where thei wolde vp & doun, Saue & sound where so hem liked; Thei fond no man that hem be-swiked. \u00b6 Achilles wolde that tyme gange To se her festes and here sange, He thoght algates he wolde se In Troye gret solennite. Here contenaunce & here porture, Here myght, here sorwe, & here voysure, Here doyng of there chere deuout, And how thei did Ector about. \u00b6 Achilles made him redi swithe, In-to the toun wente he blyue, And to the temple Apolynys &YOGH;ede he to se, what Ioye & blis Aboute Ector Troyens made: He fond ther non that was glade, But makyng dele & gret wepyng; Be-fore Ector saw he sittyng \u00b6 Ectuba, the semely quene, And hir dou&yogh;ter Pollexene; And fele ladies of gret genterie Here ther In that companye. Thair heer faire a-boute hem spred, On eyther halff hit was fair sched, Hit henged doun by-nethe her pappes, By-nethe here mydeles, by-nethe here lappes. \u00b6 Thei made gret del & sykyng, Thei were echon In euel lykyng, Mechel del & mechel mone A-boute Ector made thei echone. Ector &yogh;it sat als entere And so fair In his solere, As he was furst ther ordeyned; The baume so his body susteyned Fro al appayryng & alle sauour, And ffro chaungyng of his colour. THe tabernacle on eche a syde Was vn-done and opened wyde, That eche man, bothe &yogh;ong & old, On eche a syde Ector behold. \u00b6 Achilles loked on that werk faste; As he his eyen aboute him caste, So was he war of Pollexene Faste sittynge by the quene, He loked vpon the damysele And saw the teres fro hir fele. But thoow that lady fair & swete Wonder sore & hertly grete, \u00b6 Not-for-thi for alle hir payne Sche wex nother pale ne wayne, Sche lost not of her fayrnesse, Off hir beaute ne hir swetnesse. \u00b6 Hic Achilles Amat Pollexenam Filiam Regis Troiani MS. Troian. . Al hir wo ne al hir pyne Made hir not hur fayrnes tyne, The teres that so fro hur ran Made hir nother blo ne wan; Hit for-did no-thyng hir sight, Hir eyen were euere clere and bryght, For alle here wepyng were thei not dym, Ne sche not apayred In neuere MS. neuere y. a lym. Ther is no man that is on lyue, Hir fairnesse that myght discryue\u2014 For siker sche was as fair a woman As man scholde sette his eyen vpan. AChilles loked euere In on; So ffair a thyng as sche was on Saw he neuere In al his lyue\u2014 Widwe, ne mayden, ne non wyue. As he loked In hir vysage, His herte torned & his corage, Him hadde leuere than any thyng He hadde ben siker of that swetyng: Alle his herte and his delite Was to haue of hure a sight, He loked on hir as he were mad. The more lokyng to hir he had, \u00b6 His long lokyng hir louely sight Be-rafft him clene of his myght; But he myght not his lokyng leue, That thoght myght no man him byreue: He loked to hir the while he myght, Til the day was gon, & hit was nyght. Off alle thinges that euere was wroght Was non so mochel In his thoght; Him thoght it &yogh;ede thorow his hert, So sore sche made him ake and smert. WHen it was ny&yogh;t, the quene vp ros, And Pollexene home with here gos; Achilles loked afftir that wenche With more longyng than man may thenche, Til sche out of the temple was went. Achilles In hir loue then brent; And this was al the bygynnyng Off his sekenes and his lyggyng, That he afftir In his bed lay For loue & longyng of that may. \u00b6 When he myght hir no lenger se, His herte for sorwe brast on thre, He turned him hom to his tent And In his bed as-tite he went. That nyght for-sothe litel he scleped, He turned him offte & sore weped; Hir loue hade wounded him so depe, That he myght not that nyght slepe. He saw hir loue on him was gret, Al his body brast on swete, He tholed for hir gret penaunce, He waried thanne that foule myschaunce: \u00b6 'Alas,' seide he, 'that I was born! That I am now thus foule lorn Thorow a mayden that is so tendre, With-oute my&yogh;t, feble, & sklendre. And he that was so mychel of myght, The strengest that was In any fyght, Ector of Troye, that doughti man, That price & honour of alle men wan,\u2014 That alle the men that stalworthe wore He ouercome with strokes sore, Alle that were styff & strong That doughti kny&yogh;t to dethe throng; \u00b6 Lamentacio amoris Achillis.

Sche hatis me & al my kyn For hir brother that I slow; I may not keuere,\u2014I wot neuere how? For I may not vnto me drawe Her hert for-sothe for loue ne awe! Ne with prayeres may I not spede; I may not to MS. so . hir my loue bede, \u00b6 I may not so of loue hir pray, I may not so that lady assay. Ne my richesse ne my gret &yogh;iffte May not hir hert to me lyffte, For sche is richer for-sothe then I; I wot neuere how to come hir by?

The wo is gret that I am Inne \u00b6 Hic Achilles mandat nuncium ad Reginam. In gret wodnes am I now broght! Alas! how com I in-to this thoght! I can not wete\u2014so god me saue!\u2014 How that I here loue schal haue?' He leued that ny&yogh;t In that gret sorwe; The sonne was risen faire at morwe, A carful ny&yogh;t he thenne hadde lede, Til he was risen vp of his bede. AT morwe whan he was rysen, Off him selff was he a-grysen, Off his sorwe so strong In my&yogh;t That he hadde al that long ny&yogh;t. He called to him a siker man, Al his consayl him telle bygan And sayde: 'if thow wol trewe be, Ful riche &yogh;ifftes &yogh;eue I the; For-sothe schal I faile the neuere, I schal the make riche for euere. \u00b6 Go to Hectuba, the quene, And say: \"I loue so Pollexene, That I schal falle for-sothe In rage, But I haue hir In mariage.\" Bid hir sicurly my wordes byleue, And if sche wol me hir doghter &yogh;eue To me hastly In wedlak, That I schal remewe al this pak: The Gregeis alle schal I make go To the lond that I come fro. \u00b6 Al this ost schal I remewe\u2014 As I am a kny&yogh;t trewe!\u2014 Kynges & dukes, lord & sires,\u2014 To gret honour to hire & hires With couenaunt & condicioune, Iff sche wol haue me to hir sone. Ne thei schal neuere amendes make, Harme ne schame ne sclaunder take, For alle the harme & vylony, Slau&yogh;t of men, ne robry Some indistinct scribblings under br .

HEctuba, the quene of pris, Was ful witti & ful wis, Sche seyde to him as lufly hende: 'Abyde me here, my louely frende! This thyng may not be ent With-outen my lord kyng assent. I schal ther-fore vn-til him gange, Sicurly I dwelle not lange. What he wol say, I wol the telle; Ful longe schal I not fro the dwelle.' \u00b6 Vnto the kyng the quene hir hyed, To him this consayl sche discryed: \"What Achilles to him bed, For-whi his doughter he most wed; How he scholde alle the Gregeis gare In-to ther contre for to fare, \u00b6 Hic Priamus miratus est. And remewe & leue the sege, And be-come his man lege, And Elayn leue with Alysaundre With-outen amendis, with-oute slaundre.\" PRyamus chaunged al his blod, When he al this vndirstod; Al his blod be-gan to colde, When Hectuba thes wordes tolde; In his herte ran many a thoght, That he the quene hadde be-soght. An hundrid sithe sore he siked, When he thoght how he be-swiked His sone Ector that he sclow; At his herte was care y-now, He thoght on his deth so fast, The water of his eyen out-brast. 'Alas, the while!'\u2014the kyng seyde tho\u2014 'To graunte this thyng that me is wo! How scholde I fynde In my wil His askyng now to fulfil? How scholde I loue In body or gost Thing In erthe I hate most? That refft me al my worldis Ioye, That slow my sone, Ector of Troye!\u2014 But for to eschewe al other perrel, That more harm not to vs fel, A&yogh;eyn this thyng may I not stryue; That I may haue myne other on lyue, Myne other sones to haue lyuand, I graunt his bone myn vn-willand: So that he do furst alle these thynges That he sente hidur In tydynges, That we be [be-]trayed noght, When we haue graunted al his thoght.' \u00b6 Hic Priamus concedit Pollexenam Achilli. Hectuba, worthi In wede, To the Messanger a-&yogh;eyn &yogh;ede: 'I haue'\u2014sche seide\u2014'thin erand sayd To Priamus, that wel is payd Off his askyng; so is Paris: Bothe are thei payde of his y-wys. And I for-sothe anendis me \u00b6 Schal do his wille, that schal he se; So that no thyng be broght to ende, Or euere my doghter fro me wende.' The Messager held vp his hondes And thonked hir of tho tythandes; When he hadde graunt of his askyng, On his way &yogh;ede he syngyng: He toke his leue, for he was blythe. Ham-ward wente he thanne swithe, He made his lord bothe blythe & glad, He tolde him what answere he had Off Priamus, and of Hectuba, And of Paris; he seyde alsa: \"How thei hadde alle graunt his bone\"\u2014 'Alle thi wille for-sothe schal be done; Iff &yogh;e wol do that &yogh;e haue hete, Al schal be done with-oute lete.' IN somer was neuere no nyghtyngale, The throstel ne no wodewale, The throche ne the lauerok, The papeiay ne the throstel-cok So mery syngand In thaire note, As he be-gan thanne to lote; When that he was of here assured, Ne hadde not elles his wo endured. But than be-gan he for to kest, How he myght do this thing best. \u00b6 Hic Achilles mandauit post Reges Grecorum. That he be-het to the quene For hir dou&yogh;ter Pollexene By his man, his Messager; For hit was not In his power To remewe that company. He thoght he hadde done foly, That he hadde hight hem suche a thyng That he myght not to ende bryng. \u00b6 But not-for-thi, what vp so doun, He traist so mechel In his renoun, In his grete dedes & his chyua[l]rie That he hadde done be-fore here eye, That if if inserted over line. he leffte hem In that byker, In his herte was he sekir That thei scholde leue al her querel, For drede of harm & perel That hem schulde falle In that stour, Iff thei for-&yogh;ede his socour. HIt was a day whil trewes last, Achilles In his hert cast That he wolde make the lordes alle That were of Grece come to his halle: His Messager anon he sende To alle the lordes that were him hende, And bad hem come al at ones To speke with him In his wones. \u00b6 Ther was no lord that with-stode, That ne thei als sone to him &yogh;ode. When thei were comen thedur euerychon, Thei sat as stille as any ston; Achilles sayde: 'lordynges, my peres, Herkenes now to me and heres, Why that I sende afftir &yogh;ow For thing that is for &yogh;owre prow. I haue meruayle what vs ayled That we the kyng of Troye MS. Troyl , the l only badly altered to e . assayled, Whi that we this werre be-gan For the loue of a womman?

Ne here is non a-monges vs alle That wot w[h]at wol him by-falle; For the beste of vs echon May haue harm, and thei non, In woundes sore & gret brosures. He is a fole that him ensures In his strengthe & In his myght, For I my-selff haue ben euel dyght: \u00b6 Many a wounde haue I here tholed, My body hath ben y-holed. Was I not hurt so sore now last That I wende neuere to haue I-past?

Another womman may we serue Menelaus for to haue To his wyff,\u2014so god me saue!\u2014 That schal be genteler than was sche, In many landes & many contre. \u00b6 And we may remewe by skyl With-oute blame, when so we wil; For we haue take shenful vengaunce Off the wrong and of the greuaunce, Off the schame & of the slaunder That to vs did Alysaunder: For we haue sclayn the dou&yogh;tiest man That lyued In erthe, sithen we be-gan\u2014 \u00b6 Ector that we haue don to dede, He was alther lord and hede, He was alther mayntenour.

And with-outen any schame, With-oute reproues or any blame, When so we wil, hamward wende To oure contre & oure frende. And sicurly I rede also With-oute dwellyng that we go.' ANon that riche kyng Thoas, That Achilles Cosyn was, And the duk Menescene With-sayde him with mychel tene And seyde: 'Achilles, wold neuere god That we scholde now for euene or od Leue the sege we haue by-gonnen, Er we this Cite hadde y-wonnen, Sithen he is ded, roten & graven That the toun & hem did sauen! Iff we leue it In suche a wyse, Hit scholde be holden for cowardise; Men wolde holde vs recreaunt. God for-bede we to this graunt!' \u00b6 Achilles was wonder wrothe; Be-fore hem alle he made his othe: \"That he scholde neuere day ne ny&yogh;t Helpe hem more with his my&yogh;t; He nolde no thyng do for hem alle For no thing that my&yogh;t be-falle! \u00b6 But thei wolde saue thaire lyf or lym; And as thei loued derly him, That thei scholde helpe no more Gregeis, But holde hem stille & be In pays, And let hem do echon her best, For he & alle his wolde be In rest.\" \u00b6 And thus partid thei ful hirously, Thei hadde meruayle how-gatis & whi That he was broght In suche a wille; But thei sayde not, but helde hem stille. Achilles was euel apayed That thei his wille so with-sayd, To helpe hem more has he not ment, He sayde: \"thei schal sore repent That thei haue a&yogh;eyn him spoken\"; He thoght on hem wel be wroken, He wolde no more &yogh;iff tent to thaym Thenne he hadde MS. halde . neuere ben on of hem. \u00b6 In this tyme her mete hem fayles, Thei haue gret faute of her vitayles: Hem MS.

Agamenoun faste him rapes With alle his schippis to take the se, For he was frau&yogh;t as he wolde be; \u00b6 The wynd was to hem good y-now, Thei turned ster, and sail vp drow, And sayled forth all by the wynde\u2014 Some be-fore & some be-hynde\u2014 With alle her schippes & dromondes To Troy a&yogh;eyn to here bondes.

And day is went out of her trewes, Michel bale among hem brewes; Eche man lokes now al his gere, That it be stiff & strong to were, That no thyng wante of hem ne fayle, That thei may helpe with clowe or mayle. \u00b6 Thei are now redi In her armures And heled aboute with couertoures Off siluer & gold, riche & dere, Eche a man In his armure, Thei of Troye & Grefounes. But thei hadde the Murondones; But thei therfore leuen now In pes With hem that tyme with Achilles. Troiens thoght hem ded & foy, Sithen thei hadde sclayn Ector of Troy; But &yogh;it fond thei, when thei were met, Off her purpos wo that hem let, And did gret schame & vylony To alle the grete company. IN fel[d] ben thei now prest & proude, Thei blew her hornes schrille & loude, \u00b6 Incipit Bellum. The batayles faste to-gedir drow, The baneres with the wynd blew. These ostes were bothe long & brod: When thei with spere to-gedir rod, On ayther syde faste thei die; Her horses MS. sorses . snoure wel faste & nye, On eche a syde thei strike & wynse.

But Croseus was to grounde cast, That he myght neuere vp arise; He died anon In that ilke wyse. \u00b6 Ther was noyse and eke cry Amonges the Gregeis witterly, When thei saw him his lymes out-streke, And that he my&yogh;t no more speke. Tho layd thei on as thei were wode: Many walowed In his blode, Thei sclow ther Troyens that it was wonder; Ther was sclayn many an hunder For the deth deth inserted by another hand over line. of the riche kyng, Many a Troyen toke ther his endyng.

Thelamaneus come with him This word in the MS. is very indistinctly written, and looks more like han than him . als, With his sword aboute his hals, With alle his men of gode assise Come he doun to that porprise. Thelaman rode to sir Sisene, A noble kny&yogh;t, a good Troyene, The kynges sone y-bore on bast: Thelamon rod to him In hast He smot him so\u2014with-oute fable,\u2014 To fyght was he euere vn-able; Afftirward In al his lyff Might sir Cisene neuere thriff. \u00b6 When Dephebus saw the wounde, And his brother falle to grounde, Wel sore him greued In his red blod: He rod to Thelaman as he were wod, He smot him with so gret affray, He bar him fro his hors a-way; Wel sore he fel vpon the grounde With a wide grysly wounde. PAlamydes saw that he was doune MS. done , the v inserted by another hand. , His feet hiere than his croune; He swor he scholde that strok venge, Er that he went out of that renge. He toke to him a stalworthe spere, To Dephebus he gan it bere; To Iuste with him he him biddes, He bare him thorow the scheld ymyddes, Thorow his plates In-to his brest; Opon the grounde ful stille he rest, For In his body lefft the stompe, That he fel doun as it were a lompe. \u00b6 Sir Paris saw Dephebus falland, For he was him ner-hand; He weped for him with bothe his eye, He wiste wel he scholde deye: He drow him fro MS. for . the horses fete With michel care & herte grete, He bare him ney vn-to the toun Liggande ther In a ded swoun; Thei leyde him doun vnder the walles, And Paris fast opoun him MS. his . falles: \u00b6 His eyen be-gan he than to open That were faste to-geder stoken, He loked vp vpon Paris, He sayde: 'Paris, thow art not wys.' He seyde: 'Paris, my brother dere, Whi stondis thow by me here? Wolde thow suffer me to tyne My lyff, Paris, my brother myne, Er I be venged on my bane? Out of my brest schal neuere be tane The spere, til I haue herd tythandes That he be ded of thy two handes. As I haue loued the, Paris, brother, In al my lyff be-fore alle other\u2014 Go a&yogh;eyn & worche wisly, That he be ded rather than I!' PAris sone did him to gone With carful herte & mochel mone, He hadde of him gret compassioun, That al-most he fel a-doun: In-to that fight &yogh;ede he wepande, And lefft his brother ther lygande. When he come ther, a bowe he hente That was strong & wel y-bente; He kest aboute In al his wit Where he my&yogh;t that kyng best hit, \u00b6 Hic Paris occidit Palamidem Imperatorem. So that he my&yogh;t him sone sclo, That he on lyff went him not fro. He soght afftir Palamydes, Were he myght fynde him In that pres; He was war, where he stode Fyghtand fast as he were wode A-&yogh;eyn the gode kyng Sarpedoun MS. Sarpedon . , And he toke gode kepe ther-on. \u00b6 Sarpedon hadde he assayled, That the blod fro him doun rayled; But that kyng Palamydes Lefft Sarpedoun not so In pes: Opon his hede smote he him so, That he cleue it euen at-two; And he fel doun vpon the grounde And died with-Inne a litel stounde. When Paris saw what harm he did, What gret sorwe ther was be-tid, He toke an arwe that was entouched With foule venym\u2014as alle men souched:\u2014 \u00b6 His bowe was bent, his takel redy, And of his schot he was spedy: Paris neuere be-lan for to wayte, Til he hadde dreuen him to a bayte: When he saw him, at him he schet And hitte him In his gorget, That it &yogh;ede thorow his pesayn And cut In-two his mayster-veyn, And smot him thorow-out his gorge That he fel ded\u2014by seynt Iorge! DElful cri & hidous, A gret noyse & a meruelous Among Gregais was vp raysed; He my&yogh;t not a-monges hem be pesed. Thei hadde suche del of here gyour, That he was dede so In that stour: Afftir Paris thei folowed faste; But he was tho ful sore a-gaste, He smot his stede and hamward rode, For drede of hem no lenger a-bode. \u00b6 The Gregeis turned to her tent, The Emperour was sore bement. The Troyens sone that aspied, And to the Gregeis thei sone MS. fone . relied: Thei folwed hem with bryght swordis, As bestis gone be-fore the herdis\u2014 For-sothe at my discrecioun: The Gregeis fley to her pauyloun. But whan thei come to here hales, Ther the Gregeis made here stales, Off her hors thei gon descende And here dikes thei gan defende. \u00b6 When thei of Troye were y-war What arest thei made thar, Doun of her hors echone thei lyght,\u2014 Kyng & squyer, duk & kny&yogh;t,\u2014 And sette her fet a&yogh;eyn the dykes, And euery man at other strikes. Thei entred In at the laste; Tho were the Gregeis sore a-gaste, For her dikes thei hadde wonne And In here Pauylons thei were ronne. Thei robbed & refft alle that thei founde, Thei sente to Troye many a fair sonde: Coupes of gold, siluer vesseles, Clothes of gold, and other Iuweles, And al other thing that thei myght lacche: Broches, rynges, what thei myght cacche. PAris thenne & MS. to . Troylus &yogh;ede To the se with mochel spede With xxx ti thousand strong men, The Gregeis schippes for to bren; Thei kest wildfir In here schippes, Fro schip to schip aboute it hippes. The schippes were sone on a blase, Thei brende bothe mast & wynlase, Sterne & stere, ore & spretes, The schipmen In the water fletes. Ther ros a-boute hem many a spark, For the wynd was sumdel stark And made the lowe rise on hey, That it be-fflaumed al the sky; Thei myght it se wel In-to Troye, Thei hadde ther-fore mychel Ioye. \u00b6 But then come Thelamanyus, That noble kny&yogh;t & vigorous, And duk Nestor, that noble knyght, With Men of Grece, with mochel myght: When thei come to-gedir & met, Troyle bad faste the fir be bet, But Thelamon bad his men hit slek With water of broke or of bek. Gret was the assaut that thei be-gonne, Euery man on other ronne; \u00b6 Hedes reled aboute ouer-al, As men playe at the fote-bal; Thei lay a-boute hem wonder thikke. The fight was lyther & eke wikke, Hit was gret ruthe for to se What men died at that medle! Sicurly the sothe it is: Ne hadde it be Ayax prowes, And Nestor, the duk, that with him went\u2014 Alle her schippes hadde ben brent, That thei made brenne al to coles, With mochel wo that day thei tholes. \u00b6 The Gregeis were wel foule to-hewe, Off hem vn-hurt were ther but fewe, For al the gras that was so grene It was for-bled with knyghtes kene; For thei myght not endure For gret hete In thaire armure: Many drow out of that batayle And kest of helm & her ventayle; To cacche the wynd thei were fayn, And went to batayle sone a-&yogh;eyn. THe kynges sone of Trase, Heber, He rod doun by her tentes ther, He was wounded with a spere Thorow his body In that were, Hede & tre lefft bothe In him; His eyen be-gan to waxe dym, For sicurly his lyff was ent. Vntil Achilles Heber went, That MS. Thei . dwelled at home with mochel tene For the loue of Pollexene; He In his herte Gregeis defied, To wende with hem he denyed. \u00b6 The kynges sone that so was lamed, Achilles strongly he tho blamed: \"That he that day at hom him held With alle his men\u2014so hit is teld,\u2014 And lete ther naue so be brend, And Gregays foule slayn & schend\"; 'And thow myght saue hem fro this wo, Iff thow wolde to fight go, \u00b6 Hic Heber mortuus est. With thi strengthe & thi myght, Iff thow hadde ben to-day at fight. Hit comes the of euel wil, That thow schalt holde the thus stil And wol not helpe thi contre-men, Thow hast lorn of hem M ten.' \u00b6 Thus Heber foule Achilles myssayd And of vnkyndenes him foule vmbrayd; 'How myght thow'\u2014he sayde\u2014'In herte fynde To thi peple be so vn-kynde, And wold not haue of hem mercy? It is so sothe thi vilony! Men wol say opon the tresoun, Sithen thow leuest with-oute resoun.' \u00b6 Heber bad that men scholde drawe The spere that sat thorow his mawe; Achilles men that spere out-drow, And he fel doun ther In a swow: He died by-fore Achilles eyene With mochel wo & mychel pyne. Alitel while\u2014as I &yogh;ow telle\u2014 Herkenes now, how it be-felle! Achilles cleped him to a seruant, A strong man, a gode seriaunt,\u2014 At that batayle hadde y-bene, That hadde the slau&yogh;t of Gregeis sene, How thei died & how thei fore;\u2014 He come then ridand In at the dore, Ther his lord Achilles standes. Achilles asked: 'what tydandes? How done the Gregeis, by thi fayth? What was that noyse that was so layth? Is any lord of oures sclayn? Loke the sothe thow not layn!' \u00b6 Hic vnus homo narrauit Achillem de prelio. The seriaunt seide: 'I was, lord, thare; I schal &yogh;ow telle how thei fare: Thei may say the wrother-hayle That thei this day &yogh;ede to batayle; For sicurly: but better schape, I trowe non of hem skape With-oute deth or dethes woundes. Thei haue brent many of oure dromondes And many schippes & cogges, And sclayn oure men as frogges; \u00b6 Some are ded, & some home fle. Ther is suche novmbre & plente, My lord, for-sothe of hem of Troye: I trowe forsothe, not a boye, Ne man that may his heued were, Swerd or staff to batayle bere For-sothe with-Inne the Cite walle, That thei ne are come to batayle alle. And Palamydes, oure Emperour, He is sclayn In that stour; For that he sclow Dephebus, Paris hath him sclayn thus. But wold &yogh;e, lord, do my rede, &YOGH;e scholde do a worschip-dede, \u00b6 Iff I durst hit to &yogh;ow speke: &YOGH;e my&yogh;t now on hem be wreke, &YOGH;e myght now take suche vengaunce, For euere &yogh;e scholde &yogh;oure los enhaunce; The Troiens alle &yogh;e may now schende And wynne &yogh;owre los with-outen ende. I can &yogh;ow schewe to batayle nowe, &YOGH;e may se In batayle, howe The Troyens ar so for-fou&yogh;ten & weri; Thei schal be ferd and so dreri, And thei saw &yogh;ow thedur ride, Thei durst not on of hem abide For al the good of mydelerd; Thei scholde of &yogh;ow be so aferd, And thei hadde ones of the a sight. For thei ben now al out of myght, Thei may hem not defende longe; And thei dreden &yogh;ow, for &yogh;e ben stronge. \u00b6 Thorow al this world scholde it be spoken, How &yogh;e haue &yogh;ow of hem wroken,\u2014 And say that &yogh;oure selff alone Discomfited hem of Troye euerychone, And that &yogh;oure selff In &yogh;oure persone Did more then kynges and kynges sone, And more than al the men of Grece; To &yogh;oure honour gretly it lyse. &YOGH;e MS. &yogh;e . schal sle hem as ratons and mys, And wyn gret los for euere & prys.' AChilles stode as he were founden; Wel stronge he was In loue bounden, That maketh a man to morne & pyne, And makes hem offte his worschipe tyne, Hit makes men leue her honour, And makes hem take gret dishonour. And so ferd it with-oute les By the lord sir Achilles: He herkenes al that euere this man Off the batayle telle can, \u00b6 But he wolde not for his prechyng, Ne for al his sermonyng, Ne for no gode knyghtes dede Turne his herte & do his rede; For he loued so dame Pollex[e]ne, And he was ferd he scholde her tene; And leuere him was his los for-go Then for to falle In suche a wo. Loue hath broght him In hir chare, On his bak derne loue he bare; Fals fortune of him now filles, He put him ri&yogh;t In hir thilles, And sche be-lan neuere that kny&yogh;t to chase, Til he by hir his lyff lase. \u00b6 The fight was sesed of that day, Thei wente homward In aray; It was ny&yogh;t, the sonne wente doun, Troyle & Paris &yogh;ede to toun, And thei of Grece went al at ones MS. atones . To her tentis with weri bones. \u00b6 Dephebus was &yogh;it on lyue, When Paris come be-fore him blyue, And Troyle, his brother, sore wepand; Dephebus was &yogh;it lyuand. Thei wepe & crye as bestes braye, Thei wolde her lyff hadde ben a-waye; For his deth were thei so wrothe, Thei wolde ther die with him bothe. DEphebus lyfft vp his eye-lid, And asked his brether what thei did; Than Dephebus to Paris saythe: 'Telle me, Paris, by thi faythe, My dere brother, if that thow wot: Where he be ded that me thus smot?' \u00b6 Paris saide: 'my brother hende, God let me neuere my bowe bende Ne drawe tacle of Aspyn wandis, But I sclow him with my handis!' He bad hem than that stode him next, Draw the spere out of his brest; \u00b6 Dephebus mortuus est. Thei drow hit out byfore his eyen, Anon Dephebus gan to dyen. Thei wepe In Troye for his deth, Thei spilled for him meche breth. Bothe Priamus and Hectuba, Polexene & Cassandra, \u00b6 Paris als and dou&yogh;ti Troyle, Thei prayed her god his soule assoyle; And the Citesens & ladies alle That were tho In that halle. But what scholde I longer dwelle, What del thei made &yogh;ow to telle? I my&yogh;t not to-day ne to-morwe Telle for-sothe her grete sorwe! PRiamus let make a molde Off Iasper-stones & riche golde, And layd ther-In his sone so dere With sore wepyng & heuy chere. Another tombe dede he also make For Sarpedoun the kynges sake, And led him by his sone there With wepyng sore of many a tere. For sicurly kyng Sarpedoun Was In his tyme a stalworth man, A noble kny&yogh;t of vasselage, Hardi, & bold, and right sauage. \u00b6 Among the Gregeis with-oute wenyng Was mychel del & mornyng For that kyng Palamydes. A newe leder the Gregeis ches, For thei myght not be with-oute An Emperour for that were doute. Thei toke consayle, wham thei wolde haue That best coude ordeyne hem & saue; \u00b6 Hic Agamenoun electus est ad officium Imperatoris. Agamenon a&yogh;eyn thei chase; The eleccioun The second c may be a t . of hem alle he hase; And that was most by duk Nestor, For he spak most ther-for. AGamenoun is now Emperour I-mad a-&yogh;eyn with honour; Alle the lordes he comaundes, That thei be redy In the landes Erly at morwe, whan it was day; For &yogh;it wol thei efft assay, How thei may spede a-&yogh;eyn Dardanes, And venge hem on tho fel Troianes That haue thus slayn the dou&yogh;hti kyng Dispitously with thair schotyng. \u00b6 The sterres passen and alle the cloudes, The day dawes, the Crowe croudes, The larkis synge, the cokkes crowe, The waytes faste her pipes blowe: The Gregeis risen vp of her couches With many woundes & many bocches, But thei let not ther-fore to go Vnto the fyght that thei come fro. The sqwyers toke her harneis, Her knaues ordeyned her palfreys, Thei[r] sadel-stedis & her cou[r]seres; And rides forth kny&yogh;tes & sqwyers. \u00b6 Agamenoun In that matyne Ordaynet hem as thei schold bene. And thei of Troye by than were &yogh;are Toward Gregeis for to fare. With-Inne a while come thei to-gedur; But it made tho a lothely wedur, Hit raynes faste, thondres, & blowes, That wel was him that was with-Inne wowes. But for al that wedur & the rayn Many a gode man ther was sclayn, Many a kny&yogh;t was ouer-throwen, Her bodies lay thik sawen. \u00b6 Off Troye died many, but mo Griffons. Troyle come ouer the dounes, With hardy hert & gret fferte Come he thedur to that poygne. When he was comen a-mong that pres, The Gregeis faste to dethe he sles; Thei were In poynt to lese the plase; But then come\u2014as thei hadde grace\u2014 The gode dou&yogh;ti Diomedes With his felawe Vlixes, With twenti thousand doughti In place; The proude Troyens MS. Gregeis . thei gone to chace. \u00b6 Gret slau&yogh;t was on bothe side; But thei my&yogh;t not longe abide, The thonder & lyghtyng was so strong, That gret sorwe hit wrou&yogh;t hem among: Thei with-drow hem sone for that wedur, And toke her conseyl al to-gedur To go home for that gret tempest, For hem thoght hit was the best; For so faste doun the water &yogh;et, That thei were alle thorow wet. NOw are thei alle herbared & housed Al be-rayned and be-toused, Thei did of armes & ded on clothes; Many of hem her lyff loses For the wo that thei are Inne. I holde: he hadde gret synne That furst the were of hem by-gan, For he was bane of many a man. \u00b6 When thei were comen, thei &yogh;ede & souped, And many on for his frend drouped And for hem-selff thei seide 'alas' Thei wende neuere to passe that plas; And &yogh;it were thei so envious, So ful of Pride and meruelous, That hem was leuere echon to dye Than any of other mercy to crye. When thei hadde souped, thei &yogh;ede & sleped, And many a wydwe thanne weped, And made gret del & sikyng sore For her ffrendes thei hadde lore. WHen thei hadde scleped & saw tyme, Thei ros vp be-fore the prime And tok her hors & her atyres, Swerd, bowes, and heded vires, And &yogh;ede a&yogh;eyn In-to the ffeldes Out of her toun & here teldis, And mete to-gedur with strokes hard. Amonges hem alle was no coward, Echon other to sle coueytes, And alle men to sle waytes: Many a man to grounde was feld; But ther was non that euere him &yogh;eld, Whil thei myght hold swerd In honde, Or on her feet whil thei my&yogh;t stonde. \u00b6 But Troile come thanne with his couyne; He bar a scheld of asure fyne, A lyoun of gold ther-on was paynt. When he was comen to that prasaynt Ther Troye MS. Troyl . & Grece to-gedur ware, Many a man to grounde he bare, Many a lord that day he slow And fro her horsis doun hem drow. \u00b6 Then come thedir Diomedes, And his falawe Vlixes, And the gode Thelamanyus, A strong kny&yogh;t & a vigorous, Duk Menescene, and kyng Thoas; Thei made ther sone a ferly chas. And Agamenoun, her Emperour, Come to that peple In that stour. Lord! the Peple that ther was ded! Thei smot of many Troyen hed, \u00b6 The Peple lay as thikke as strawe, Or the corn whan it was sawe. Thei held to-gedur fight mortel Seuen dayes continuel; They fau&yogh;t to-gedir seuen dayes With-outen rest, with-oute delayes, Til al the feld ouer-al a-boute Was be-sprad\u2014euery a cloute\u2014 Off gode bodies that lay ded Off Troye & Grece\u2014so god me red! Seuen dayes to-gedir thei fau&yogh;t, That thei rest neuere but the nau&yogh;t. When thei hadde fou&yogh;ten a ful seuen nyght, The Gregeis asked then respit, Thei asked trewes & gryt[h]e To haue reste a two monethe, Til the dede men were leyd in graue; No \u00b7lenger wolde thei then craue. THei sent her men to Priamus, Ful witti men, & seyde thus: \"That al the feld lay be-throng With dede bodyes with sauour strong\"; Thei asked the trewes wekes ey&yogh;te, For elles myght thei not fy&yogh;te; \u00b6 Hic ceperunt pacem ad inuicem .viij to . septimanas. Til alle the bodyes were y-graue, So long wolde thei the trewes haue. The kyng hem graunted by a-visement And ther-to made he his surment To holde hem stable, and thei also, And no dissait ther-In do. THe while that the trues last, Agamenon In his herte cast, How he my&yogh;t best Achilles brynge With hem a&yogh;eyn to here fyghtynge. He sente afftir Diomedes, Duk Nestor, and Vlixes; When thei were comen, he bad hem tho: \"That thei scholde to Achilles go, And thei scholde him by-seke With faire wordes and with meke, That he wolde come with hem to fyght\"; 'Now,' seyde he, 'kythe &yogh;oure slyght! \u00b6 Let se now &yogh;oure qwayntyse, That he ne late vs In no wyse!' Thei did her princes comaundement, \u00b6 Hic miserunt ad Achillem On the left side in MS. . To Achilles alle thei went; Off her comyng was he glad, The lordis to sitte by him he bad; Thei sette hem doun\u2014as he hem bade,\u2014 Thei dronken the wyn and made hem glade. ULixes, that most was wis,\u2014 Coude non so wel say his devys,\u2014 He seyde: 'Achilles, be &yogh;oure leue! That I schal say, take it not on greue: I haue meruayle with-oute any othe, Whi &yogh;e be with vs so wrothe? That &yogh;e of vs on this wise fille, And haue turned &yogh;oure hert & wille A&yogh;eyn vs alle and &yogh;oure owne dede, And &yogh;e ben not with vs at rede.

Was it not furst &yogh;oure oune entent, And alle the lordes that with &yogh;ow went, Kynges, & princes off gret power, And alle the lordes that now ligge her,\u2014 Oure owne londis for to leue And Priamus his landis be-reue?

ME is leuere lese my name, Alle my los, & my gode fame, Then here to dye In wo & pyne And lye here stynkyng as a swyne.' \u00b6 Nestor duk and Diomedes Thei prayed bothe sir Achilles And seyde: \"her Emperour him be-soght, That he wolde leue that wil & thoght That he was In, and Armes bere, And help hem to mayntene the werre.\" But alle her prayer and her sawe Were not that tyme worth an hawe. \u00b6 Her fair speche my&yogh;t him not brynge, Ne prayer nother of duk ne of kynge Put of his herte & his purpos, For noght that euere thei myght glos, Ne her alther Emperour. But sayde \"that it was more honour At Priamus to aske the pes, Then be to-hewen as other wes.\" \u00b6 The kynges saw thei myght not spede, Thei toke her leue and home &yogh;ede; Thei fond her Emperour In his halle, Wel curteysly thei gret him alle.

With-Inne a while were thei alle met Ther to-geder and doun set. \u00b6 Agamenoun tolde his tale To alle the lordis In that sale: \"How he hadde sent Diomedes, Duk Nestor, and Vlixes, To pray Achilles for charite,\"\u2014 'And for the loue of &yogh;ow and me, That he wolde vs helpe In oure werre.

And thoow it be that Achilles Help vs not, but holde his pees,\u2014 With-oute his help & his vertu We schal these other sone vencu.' \u00b6 But then ros vp Duk Nestor That I spak of right now be-for After this last word n is erased. , And the wise kny&yogh;t sir Vlixes That sat to-gedir on the des; Thei seyde: 'it is no wonder, sir, Thoow thow batayle more desir.

Off no thyng are thei a-bayst, In her goddis haue thei suche traist; With-oute Achilles ar thei bold The fyght a&yogh;eyn to take & hold. He is for-&yogh;eten with feble & strong, As thoow he hadde not ben hem among. Thei wente alle hom to here ostel, Thei daunsed & sang & made revel. The terme is went & passed a-way, The morwe next schal be her day That thei schal fyght to-gedur In feld, Ther schal be reuen many a scheld, Many a bryght basenet Schal be with blod foule y-wet. DAy is went out of the trewes, Ther is gret noyse among the Grwes, \u00b6 Hic faciebant Magnum Bellum. Thei Arme hem faste at that tyde, To hem of Troye thei faste ride, Armed wel In her harneis. Now gon to-gedur Troiens & Gregeis: The vanwardis met with gret hidoure, Thei rod to-gedur with gret vigoure; \u00b6 A thousand speres brast In-sonder, Ther died kny&yogh;tes many hunder. When thei to-gedir with speres rides, Many on the dethe ther abydes; Thei toke ther many an euel garter, Some loste al his on quarter, Some his hede, & som his guttis; Eche man other doun puttis. \u00b6 The stour was strong & perilous, The day was hote, the men yrous: Thei schotte arwes & keste gauelokkis, Thei dyght foule her paltokkis; Knyghtes falle, and stedis stray, The dede bodyes on hepe lay. BVt then come theder dou&yogh;ti Troyle And be-gan amonges hem royle, Among Gregeis be-gan he pugne, That thei made many a lothely groyne. For his brother that thei sclow He did hem sorwe & wo y-now; His brother deth he hadde In mynde,\u2014 As thei of Grece fforsothe fynde,\u2014 Ful shrewedly hem dyghtes, He slow that day many knyghtes. \u00b6 Then come Menelaus ride With men of Armes And mychel pride, And the doghti Diomedes With mychel peple to that pres, With many knyghtes stronge & gode; Thei sclow Troiens as thei were wode, And felde hem thikke vpon the grounde. Ther died of hem many thousonde, On bothe halff thei scle men faste Al the day, til euen laste. For hit was nyght, the sonne goth west, Thei drow hem homward to her rest, Thei parted so fro that fyght And &yogh;ede hom alle, for it was nyght. THei of Troie are In the toun, And Gregeis In her pauyloun; Euery man goth to his rescet, Her mete is dyght and to hem fet, Thei sitte alle for to soupe With many a lyuer, longe, & croupe; Many a man among hem drouped And &yogh;ede to bedde, whan thei hadde souped, And rest hem til hit was day, That thei my&yogh;t make a foule deray. \u00b6 For thei of Grece were sore a-gramed And gretly tened and sore a-schamed Off hem of Troye for that day be-forn, For her gode men thei hadde lorn: Thei samed hem alle on an hepe, Thei toke her hors & vpward lepe, Thei rod so forth vpon a renge, For thei wolde hem fayn venge; \u00b6 Thei alle are went of here hales, Thei passe her piles & her pales. Wel hard thei to-geder rode With baneres faire & eke brode, Som of sandel, som of ynde, To-geder betande with the wynde. The Gregeis toke thenne the feld; And thei of Troye that be-held That thei were so to hem comande, Thei &yogh;ede a-&yogh;eyns hem faste ridande Off gode aray & gode manere, With many a spere and brod banere. When thei come ner, to-gedur thei ran, And sclow be-twene hem many a man; Scheldes and helmes &yogh;ede al to dust, Thei toke ther many a sori crust. BVt the dou&yogh;ti Diomedes Ful wondirly the Troiens sles: He smot of hondis with alle the nayles, He made hem greued\u2014it was meruayles,\u2014 He pared her chekes al aboute, That al here tethe fellen oute. He sclow and woundid & bar to erthe Two & thre and so the fferthe, \u00b6 He smot of hedes, leg, & arme; That day did he moche harme To hem of Troye & her meygne. Troyle knewe, that it was he That did his men that vilony; He vowed to god: \"he scholde a-by; Iff he my&yogh;t ride as he hath ment, On of hem scholde haue a dent.\" \u00b6 Diomedes he ascried, And afftirward he him defied: 'War the wel'\u2014seyde he\u2014'fro me! For thi dedis I defye the!' 'And I the!' seyde the knyght, 'Her my treuthe to the I plyght: I wol the not certis refuse, Ne thow schalt the fro me ascuse.' Thei to-gedur as ffaucouns fflyes, For-sothe that on of hem a-byes: Diomedes brast his spere, But he did Troyle no-thyng dere; \u00b6 But Troyle smot him with al his mayn That ney-hande he hadde ben sclayn, He fel him fro his hors swonande Among her hors ded neyhande. When he was thus on grounde y-layd MS. A second thus between grounde and y-layd in MS. , Troyle ful foule him missayd For Brixaida that was his leff, He reuyled him as he were a theff. But his men were for him dred: Thei drow him fro her hors tred, Thei leyd him on his scheld soffte And led him hom vn-to his loffte; Wel sore y-hurt, In a swone, Thei bare him to his Pauylone. \u00b6 When Menelaus that was him by Saw Troyle that knyght so sturdy For that wounde that Diomedes laught, He hadde ther-fore wel mechel aught, He wyste ful wel that he was hurt. Menelaus to Troyle sturt, He by-gan sir Troyle ban[n]e For him & rode to him thanne To venge the kyng Diomedes; For or thei parted, he bou&yogh;t that res: \u00b6 Troylus spere was with-outen brekyng As he felde with that other kyng; To Menelaus Troylus whirled That scheld and hauberk bothe thrilled, He bare him vndir his hors fete, Off his blod he was al wete. His men then qwyk him drow,\u2014 For him thei hadde sorwe y-now,\u2014 Thei toke & layde him on his scheld And bare him home vn-to his teld. WHan Agamenoun, her Emperour, Saw his men so fare In that stour,\u2014 Thei were almost with-oute myght, Thei were ney-hande put to flyght,\u2014 He gadered his men to-gedur samen, And than be-gan a newe gamen; Then come thedur Vlixes Something erased after ' Vlixes. ' With men of armes, a huge pres, \u00b6 And the gode kyng Thoas That sori was ffor that kynges cas, And the gode kyng Thelamaneus, And the gode kyng Menesceus. Lord, the sorwe that ther by-gan! Ther was slayn many a man, Many a man and many a knyght Was sclayn that day In that fight. Thei sclow Troyens doun to grounde, And many flowe with hidous wounde. \u00b6 Thelameneus tok a spere And to Troyle began it bere: He &yogh;aff Troyle suche a weshayle That he flow ouer his hors tayle, And &yogh;aff him a wounde bitter and sore That on his scheld he was hom bore; His hors was eke tho y-slawe, Out of that batayle he was drawe. \u00b6 Paris ferd as he were wod, Many a Grew ther lost his blod; Thei leyde hem faste to grounde With many an hidous wounde. Gret was the slau&yogh;t and the wo That among the Gregeis was tho. \u00b6 Agamenoun, her Emperour, Was sore hurt In that stour, And so was many a gode kny&yogh;t Dede & wounded In that fyght. The stour was gret, the fyght plener, But Gregeis were of non MS. nom. power A&yogh;eyn hem lengur to holde fight; And eke it was ney the nyght, For to her Pauyloun anon he went; For hadde thei abeden, thei hadde ben schent. \u00b6 Thei fledde echone with-Inne the diches With gret sorwe and sore sikes, The Troyens ffolwed with her myght; But it was tho al at nyght: Thei wente hom to her Cite With her kny&yogh;tes & her meygne. AGamenoun coude no gale, He hadde y-bled, he was pale; He saw what wo & perel To him & his that day befel, How Diomedes, that doughti kyng, Was hurt so sore at that Iustyng, And he my&yogh;t not him selff helpe; His sorwe coude he to no man &yogh;elpe. And Menelaus MS. Me\u00f1elaus. , his brother, eke He was so hurt that he lay seke. Bothe thes kynges In bed lay For harm thei toke of Troyle that day; Wonder sore and delfully He was hurt & greuously, He dredde him sore to ffyght lengur, Til thei & he myght be strengur; \u00b6 Hic ceperunt Pacem ad inuicem per .vj. menses. For if he did, he hoped wele Off his men to lese gret dele. He sente ther-fore to Priamus, To Paris, and to sir Troylus, To haue a trewe a six moneth, That thei myght rest In pes & grith. \u00b6 Priamus and his consayle Graunte trewes with-oute fayle. And that was certis a&yogh;eyn her wille Off many of tho that longed him tille; Thei seyde: \"it was foly strong To graunte Gregeis a trewe so long.\" But wham it likes & wam it rewes, On bothe parties ben graunted trewes. BRyxeida that louely was,\u2014 The Biscop[es] doghter Calcas, That fair louely womman, That sumtyme was sir Troyle lemman,\u2014 When the tydandes to hir was seyde That Diomedes In bed was layde, A&yogh;eyn hir fadur comaundement To vysite him ful offte sche went; For sche wiste he toke the falle Off Troyle that was hir specialle. \u00b6 Sche wiste wel In hir thoght Off Troyle scholde sche neuere haue noght; Sche hoped neuere of him mariage; Sche chaunged her wil & corage: Doghti Troyle sche gan forsake, To Diomedes sche gan hir take: Sche sayde sche wolde with him dele For any man, whan he hadde hele; For to him sche &yogh;aff al hir talent, For he hadde mechel on hir y-spent, And loued hir wel, and sche him als\u2014 As wymmen doth that offten ben fals. hAlf h inserted by later hand, erasure of some three or four letters after lf ; the first writing seems to have been Affter . a &yogh;er may thei now reste, The trewe is so be-twene hem feste; Thei may hele wele the whiles Alle her bocchis & her biles, Thei may hem hele In here soiornyng.

He sent affter by a knyght Afftir duk Nestor, that man of myght; He come to him at his sendyng, And he was fayn of his comyng. To Achilles bothe thai &yogh;ede To loke if that thei may spede; \u00b6 Agamenoun his wil assayed, Ful ffaire Achilles he ther prayed: \"That he wolde turne his herte & wil And let the Gregeis so not spil, And come with hem In her batayle And at her nede no more hem fayle.\" But for al that thei be-sou&yogh;t, Ne my&yogh;t thei him chaunge right nou&yogh;t; He swore his othe & made a vow; 'I wol no more helpe &yogh;ow!

Agamenon . bad the Grwes: \"To Arme hem and dight hem faste, For it was tyme that thei were paste \u00b6 Aliud Bellum. In-to the feld a-&yogh;eyn her fos.\" Eche man to Arme him gos. Ther was thanne a semely syght Off many a gentil man & knyght That semely set vpon her stedis; . . . . . No gap in MS. Many a sadel was ouergiltis, Many a sword with golden hiltis. Many baner blew a-boute, Ful loude the wynd hem made route. \u00b6 Achilles gadered his knyghtes alle Aboute him thanne In-to his halle, He bad thei scholde her Armes take For Agamenoun loue MS. lone . and his sake; To alle his men worthi & digne Delyuered he a newe signe As red as any blod, And &yogh;aff hem leue with heuy mode To wende forthe to her batayle, Here foos boldly to assayle. AChilles weped an hundred teres At her wendyng vpon his leres; His men echon forthe stalked; Vnto the folk ful soffte thei walked. Ther was by-gonne wel that tyme, For it was thanne half way Prime: \u00b6 The Troyens felde & slow Gregeis Ful wonderly\u2014as Dares says;\u2014 Troyle falles al that he hittes, Many of hem her hert-blod spittes. And thei of Troye died faste As thikke as men myght caste . . . . . No gap in MS. The Gregeis hem cleuen alle doun And bere hem ouer her hors arsoun That men myght here a perlusoun. \u00b6 Duk Menescene defendis his folk, He smot many In the nekke holk; And duk Nestor him wele halpe: Thei &yogh;aff the Troyens many a talpe; On ayther syde thei fel to grounde With many a grym hidous wounde. \u00b6 Thei fau&yogh;t al day whil the sonne schyned, Fro the morwe that thei hadde dyned Vntil thei hadde of day no lyght; Thei &yogh;ede home for defaute of syght, And euery man wente to his Inne\u2014 Til thei my&yogh;t efft her note by-gynne. DAy is comen, & nyght is gone, The Gregeis are vppe & dyght echone, And thei of Troye are comen doun, Armed wel, out of the toun. Thei ran to-geder as wode thinges, Echon other al to-diggis; Many of hem ligge In a dwale, May no man make acorde fynale. \u00b6 In erthe was neuere suche a semble: And that may alle men here & se That romaunce may vndirstonde & rede, Other therto wol take hede. In alle the bokes that men haue sene Off dou&yogh;ti men that haue bene, When thei are thorow soght, Sicurly ne fynde men noght That suche a fyght In erthe befel, Sithe Eue bare Caym and gode Abel; \u00b6 That so fele kynges, dukes, and lordes Were gadered to-gedur for on discordes. Hit was neuere, lord! In geste ne sang Off werre In erthe that last so lang, Ne that so many men to dethe wente As did ther, or the batayle ente;\u2014 Ne neuere of sege that so longe lay, Ne neuere schal to domysday;\u2014 Ne men that myght so longe endure To fight euery day In her Armure With-oute reste and with-oute sese, That thei toke neuere trewe ne pese. \u00b6 Ne held thei not sumtyme assaut, Day be day to-gedur thei faut, That thei rest neuere ful doughtyly A ful monethe contynuely. But men may se ther-by that can, What strengthe & my&yogh;t ther hadde a man; \u00b6 For now lyues nother man ne kny&yogh;t That if thei were put to that fy&yogh;t, That thei ne scholde be for-done, Long tyme or it were none; And thei be-gan at sonne rysyng. But that liggis not In my spekyng, I wol speke ther-of no more, But turne a-&yogh;eyn ther I was ore. THe stoure haue thei of Troye be-gonne, And thei of Grece ben to hem ronne And made In her armure many a brek, Many a man lay slawe ded sterk. A riche kyng was called Philomene, A worthi kny&yogh;t, a kynde Troiene, And also sir Palidomas,\u2014 Thei two to-gedir met kyng Thoas: \u00b6 Thei layd vpon him bothe at ones, Thei brosed his flesch and eke his bones; His myght vayled him not of two lekes, Thei toke him maugre his chekes. Off that prese drow thei him out, And drow him forth fro alle his rout. \u00b6 But that saw thenne the Murmydones, How he was lad ffro his Gryffones; But thei wolde him not so lete passe, Thei gadered alle a-boute Thoas: Thei tere for him many a ribbe Off many lord & many sibbe, And many an hed thei al to-schyuered, And fro her hand thei him delyuered. THo was Troyle ful sore tened: That he was so dyght sore he mened, He swor by god & by his swyre: \"Thei scholde abye that dyntes dere.\" He strok his stede amonges hem alle, Some he sclow & some mad falle, He brak her hedes vnder her hode. But thei manly a-&yogh;eyn him stode, \u00b6 Thei sclow vndir him his stede That Troylus doun to grounde &yogh;ede\u2014 As he most nede\u2014when his hors fayled. But he lepe vp & hem assayled, Gret defence gan he make; But thei were besy him to take, But he was closed him-self alone Amonges hem on fote echone. \u00b6 But Paris thanne\u2014whan he it wiste\u2014 Amonges the Gregeis In he thriste; His halff-brother with-al him with, And many another of that kyth: Thei brak with force her scheltroun, And sclow ther many a Murmidoun. Another hors to Troyle was broght, And he lepe vp\u2014as he neuere roght Off no lyues man that was his foo\u2014 He lepe vp sone as a roo. For sir Troyle delyueraunce An hard batayle & gret distaunce Be-gan Paris & hem be-twene, For Murimdones hadde mochel tene, Gret Angwys, & mochel wo That Troylus scholde so qwit go: Thei leyde thanne Troiens hard vpon, Thei sclow that tyme Margariton, That was sir Troylus half-brother; Ther died of Troyens many an MS. & . other For the delyueraunce of sir Troyle, Many a Troien to dethe did royle. TRoyle was horsed atte devise Vpon a stede of moche prise. He thoght thei scholde not pas qwite; He thoght to venge that foule dispite And vilony that thei hadde tan, Off hem that were his brothr ban: He wounded hem, he felde & sclow, And of her horses doun hem drow; But thei were wyse of werre & sclye, Styff & strong, & ful dou&yogh;tye: \u00b6 Thei saw thei were In gret perel, Thei drow hem alle on a roundel And of hem-selff made thei castel. But that vayled hem not a wastel\u2014 For Troyle was euere on hem so asper, That many a riche ston of Iasper Smot he a-way vpon her crestes, And sclow hem as thei hadde ben bestes; Thei lafft the feld & fledde hamward. Then was comynge thedirward The Emperour Agamenon And The duk Thelamon, With alle here men Vlixes, So did the gentil Diomedes; Menelaus come with hem thanne With many a thousand armed menne: The Murimdones thanne wel reschewed, To the Troyens than no game growed, For thei were some I-bore to grounde, And many ther dede In that stounde. But when Troyle saw hem come socour And sclow his men so In that stour, \u00b6 No lenger thanne sir Troyle abode 'Hic deficit ' written in the margin by another hand. , In-to that Cite sone he rode Ther his men were most trauayled, And he the lordis alle assayled: He sclow her men & fouly fouled, With hem so Troylus toyled, That only thorow sir Troylus myght So were the Gregeis al discomfyght And flende faste as thei were wod, That Troyle reved many his blod.

Duk Nestor with alle his my&yogh;t Come theder tho with many a kny&yogh;t, And the noble kyng Thoas. Tho by-gan a grisly cas: Thei that fledde turned a&yogh;eyn, Thei sclow the Troyens with my&yogh;t & mayn; \u00b6 The Gregeis wan a-&yogh;eyn the feld And droff hem than fro her tent & teld, \u00b6 Hic Achilles Interrogauit de hominibus suisque nouA. And droff hem thanne a-&yogh;eyn her wil With gret sorwe that place vn-til. But for Troyle & al his myght The Troyens were y-put to flyght, The Gregeys folewes & made hem falle, Thei flow to Troye the Troyens alle. The day was gon, the nyght was comen, The Gregeis went hom al & somen, Thei wente home al vpon a rase With her prisouns & her purchase. THe Gregeis were fayn that it was ny&yogh;t, For thei hadde trauayled a-&yogh;eyn her my&yogh;t; For if the sonne had lenger schyned, Off her folk schold thei haue tyned. The Murimdones to-gedur alle &YOGH;ede to her lordes halle, Alle for-wounded & for-bled. He asked hem: \"how thei hadde sped.\" \u00b6 Thei made to him a lothely playnt And seyde: \"thei were alle a-taynt For gret angwys of that Iornay That thei hadde suffred In fight that day.\" Thei seyde also: \"that many of his Were sclayn at that gret appris.\" He made hem come before him than And tolde the bodyes of euery a man: \u00b6 When thei were rekened & told be tale Be-fore Achilles In his hale, He fond a thousand of hem fayled Off kny&yogh;tes that were y-rolled & tayled. When thei were soght & alle ded founden, He seyde: 'alas, that I was bounden In womannes loue & womannes bounde!' Whan so many were ded founde, He siked sore for hem & drouped. Ful litel mete that nyght he souped, To his bed Achilles went With carful herte & gret torment: He wolde him-self hadde ben ded, He wist neuere what was his red, Whether he myght to batayle wende To venge his men or eke his frende, Or he scholde &yogh;it abyde To wete wat grace my&yogh;t be-tyde. He thoght al nyght so faste & wepe, That he myght for no thyng slepe: \u00b6 He thoght he wolde go at morne And venge his men that were y-lorne, That thei of Troye hadde foule sclayn; But then thoght he a&yogh;eyn That if he [to] batayle &yogh;ede, Off his erand he scholde not spede, Ne haue that louely to his wiff That he loued more than his lyff: That kynges dou&yogh;ter Pollexene\u2014 For he hadde het trewely the quene \u00b6 That he scholde neuere helpe Gregeis, But lete hem worthe & holde his pays. And if he &yogh;ede tho & bikerd A&yogh;eyn the trouthe that he hadde sikerd, He myght lyghtly that louely [greue], And thei scholde him no more leue, But sey it were a fals couyne\u2014 And so scholde he that lady tyne; And leuer were him his lyff to-gang, Er he for-&yogh;ede hir loue out lang. MAny dayes lyued he so lange In these paynes styff & strange, With-oute murthe and eke Ioye, Til thei of Grece & thei of Troye Scholde assemble to-gedur efft, For that wolde thei for no thyng were lefft. Til that on part Maystres were, Wold thei not leue her werre there. \u00b6 But it were ouer-gret takyng, And wel gret the makyng,\u2014 To telle the fightis that thei fau&yogh;t And alle her dedis at alle her sau&yogh;t, To telle here dedis and here fyght Be-twene Troy & Grece\u2014by goddis myght! Alle her dedis may I not telle, For ther-vpon I wol not dwelle. THe day is comen thei schul mete; That foule baret wolde thei not lete, Thei hadde to-geder so gret envy That thei wold not leue her foly. Bothe Bothe over But inserted by another hand. parties were redi dight, Thei wente to-geder with al her myght: And whan thei were to-geder met, Echon of hem on other schet\u2014 As thei hadde ben wode & mad. Ther died many a lord & lad, Many knyght & eke baroun, And many other proude Gryffoun. \u00b6 Many a lord & gentil man Was ded ther, er thei be-lan, Many a kynges sone of kynde\u2014 I may not make of alle mynde. But seuen dayes with-oute les Fau&yogh;t thei to-geder with outen pes, Day be day with-oute trewes, Til thei hadde lorn many of the Grwes. \u00b6 Achilles euere In pes him held, That he bar neuere helme ne scheld Off al that while a-&yogh;eyn Troiens, To dere none of here Citesens. The Grewes by-gan faste to fayle, The Emperour seyde thanne: 'hylhayle! We may now sone be al for-done, But if this lord helpe vs sone; But Achilles on vs rewe, Ther schal not skape of vs a Grewe!' WHen thei hadde fou&yogh;ten seuen dayes, Agamenon Priamus prayes To graunte a trewes by othe & treuthe; For it to se hit was moche reuthe, How alle the feld lay ful of men And lay & stank In that fen. Trewes longe wolde thei haue had, For Agamenon was sore a-drad That he scholde many of his men lese With hem of Troye & of Frese, Iff thei mayntened lenger that stour; Thei asked therfore a long soiour. \u00b6 But the Troyens seyde: \"thei scholde non haue But that thei myght her dede men graue;\" Thei wold no lenger the trewes graunte, Thei held hem alle recreaunt. And that rewed Agamenon sore And alle the Gregeis that with him wore, Thei my&yogh;t no lenger the trewes haue; That rewed hem sore\u2014so god me saue!\u2014 For thei were wounded and al to-bete, And hadde biles and bocches grete For strokes thei &yogh;aff & eke toke, Whil thei to-gedur ffau&yogh;t that woke. But &yogh;it were thei of that trewe fayn That thei my&yogh;t bery that thei hadde sclayn, Thei gadered alle the bodyes colde That lay ther ded vpon the wolde; And did alle the bodyes be brende, Or the trewes was fully ende,\u2014 Longe or the trewes was comen to ende, That thei scholde efft to batayle wende. THe trewes ar went that thei had set, The day is comen of her baret: Thei toke ther many a strok & ffylche, Thei tare her plates and her pilche, When bothe the parties to-geder were comen; Many Ane MS. Aue . his lyff was him be-nomen, When bothe parties were met thare, And to that batayle were alle &yogh;are. \u00b6 Sir Menelaus Paris sawe, To him he thoght for to drawe; He hadde gret wil & couetyse To se sir Paris feet a-ryse. He strok his stede & to him ran For the loue of his lemman, To grounde were thei y-bore bothe,\u2014 The kny&yogh;tes were that tyme so wrothe. \u00b6 Polidamas, Antenor sone, With gret envy & gret raundone For alle the men and al the pres With his swerd he smot Vlixes; But he &yogh;aff not ther-of an hawe, For he him held with swerd y-drawe. The noble vaylaunt Menescene Smot Antenor\u2014& that was sene,\u2014 He &yogh;aff him suche a romelowe, That he wente ouer his sadil-bowe; \u00b6 Hic Archilogus interfecit Gryme Gwynel. He layde him as brod & flat As is a pike when he is splat. \u00b6 Then come ridande Philomene, A doghti kyng, a knyght Troyene: Agamenon he assayled That the blod of him doun rayled. Philomene, of so gret myght, Wolde ful euel haue him dyght,\u2014 But that him come socour sone, I trowe his dayes hadde ben done. \u00b6 But Thelameus to him toke hede And saw that he of help hadde nede, He toke a spere that was stalworthe, And turned his hors & rod forthe: To Agamenon he him hyed And smot Philomene that he doun syed Fro MS. ffor . his hors for his labour, For he wolde for to her Emperour. STrong was the stour, perelous, & fel; Ther was a kny&yogh;t, het Gryme Gwynel, He was on of Priamus sones\u2014 As I fynde In thes Canones\u2014 That he hadde geten In his purchase, In his murthe & his solace. Duk Nestor hadde a sone also, A doghti knyght, Archilogo; Thei mette to-geder, he & Gryme,\u2014 A gret vn-hap! a foule fortune! \u00b6 Archilogus bare sir Gryme thorowe, And lefft him ded In a forwe. The Troyens made gret del ther-fore, Ther died for him mo thenne foure score; For when that tale to Troyle was told, He my&yogh;t not for him fro wepyng hold, For he loued him with al his myght For that he was so doghti a knyght. Troylus eyen be-gan to slyse, The Gregeis sone he gan dispyse: Many for him he be-hedit, Echon fro other he sone schedit; Thei fled echon sir Troylus fro, Thei made him way & lete him go; He droff hem faste ouer doune & dale, Among hem wroght he suche bale. \u00b6 Thei were ney dreven to her Pauylons, Ne hadde thanne comen the Murondons; But the[i] styffly a&yogh;eyn him stode, But Troylus ferd as he were wode: Whan he saw hem a&yogh;eyn him stande, He rod to hem faste manassande; Vpon her hedes sette he suche dyntes, The fyr fley out as it were of fflyntes. \u00b6 He was so sore with hem greued, That many an hed he ther to-cleued, Here scheldes fro her scho[l]dres racched; Ful many a Gregeis he ther atacched, He bete hem so and so defouled, That thei with blod were al be-stouled, As thei were paynt with rede coloures; He made hem like tormentoures, Thei toke of him many a cloute. Tho with al the haste that thei moute \u00b6 Thei turned the bak and fro him &yogh;ede,\u2014 On rounsi prekand, and on stede,\u2014 Til thei were comen to her hales, To saue her lyff ther In her sales. But Troyle & his afftir hem sted, Thei sclow many of hem that fled; \u00b6 Hic fugerunt ad tentorias suas. To her tentis he hem droff. But ther turned thei a-&yogh;eyn & stroff, For thei of Troye her dyche wolde wynne, But thei wolde not that thei come Inne: \u00b6 Thei gadered alle vpon a route, To holde the Troyens tho with-oute; But Troyens doun of her hors lyght, And than be-gan the perilous fyght: For Troyens be-gan foule to fare; Than by-gan Gregeis kare, The Troyens felde hem In her dike; Tho by-gan thei sore to sike; \u00b6 Her my&yogh;t was nou&yogh;t a-&yogh;eyn Troiens. Troylus then, & Philomens, And kyng Mennon made thanne entre And made hem fro her men to fle; Thei flowe alle In-to her tentis, Many of the Gregeis her deth hentes: THei made of hem gret tormentry, Ther was an hidous noyse & cry, Thei sclow hem In her pauylons; Wel delful was of hem the sounes, So wonderful and meruelous That hit was dredful & hidous: Hit ferde as hit hadde thondrid, Achilles was ther-of a-wondrid \u00b6 Off wham he herde that delful cry, He saw men come prikande him by That flede fro that scomfiture, Makynge sorwe with-oute mesure. Thei seyde: \"alas that thei come thore, For thei were lorn for euere-more!\" With-out his tent smartly sterte he, To se what dele that myght be. AChilles was gretly meruayled What hem of Grece ayled. He asked hem: \"whi thei so ferde? And what was the noyse that he herde?\"\u2014 'How dos oure kynges, and oure Gregeis? How bere thei hem a-&yogh;eyn the Frigais?' \u00b6 'Louely lord'\u2014sayde thei that ffledde\u2014 'We are so hurt and so for-bledde, That we Are alle of nompower A&yogh;eyn hem to fyght any lenger. Iff &yogh;e wol off vs tydandis here, Carful tydandes may &yogh;e lere; \u00b6 Herkenes now of oure tythandes! Sicurly, lord, now vndirstandes: &YOGH;e schal neuere on lyue se Gryffons, Ne non of alle &yogh;oure Murimdons. We telle &yogh;ow, lord, that thei of Grece Schal sone be hewen al to pece, For thei are alle discomfit And alle haue taken the flyt; \u00b6 Thei are alle fled In-to her tentis, Ther many of hem the dethe hentis. Thei defended here entres, But thei felde doun bothe cordes & tres, And sclow oure Gregeis cruelly, Woundes & stikes with-oute mercy. Hem fayles now the grete socour, And this is, lord, the grete clamour Off hem that dye, that grysly bray,\u2014 That &yogh;e haue herd and &yogh;it may. \u00b6 Thei schal alle dye, er that thei sese; And &yogh;e that wene to stonde In pese, &YOGH;e schal se sone on &yogh;ow comande Mo then ffyue & ffyffty thousande Hic Achilles Iratus est.

For Ector deth\u2014by heuene kyng!\u2014 That were, lord, her herte wil, Might thei, lord, thi body spil.' AChilles chaunged al his mode, He loked aboute as he were wode When he herde this tydynges: He clapped his hondes, and alle his rynges Sicurly In-sonder brast; To and fro his armes he cast, As he hadde ben a wod man; Wel harde to swete he be-gan. \u00b6 Achilles seyde on that wolde To him that these tydandes tolde: 'Is ou&yogh;t Troyle In that place, That makes oure men thus to chase?' He sayde: 'lord, ther he is, And alle oure men he dos amys; For his wodnesse & his deray Alle oure men ben fled a-way; \u00b6 For he is so strong In his myght, Ther may non a-byde him In fight.' 'Alas!' he seyde, 'that euere Moder me bar! Whi ne were I right now thar? \u00b6 Hic Achilles Iratus est. Alas that euere me Moder bounde Or euere In MS. Or euere me In . cradel me be-wounde! That I scholde for a wommanes sake Let my enemys suche murther make Off my Men and of my kyn, And do ther-of no medicyn!' \u00b6 He was so ful MS. sul . of tene & ire That he bad fecche his atire; He for-&yogh;ate ther Polexene And al that he be-het the qwene. His stede was sone j MS. . -dight With clene harneis & bridel bryght, He lepe vp anon vpon his stede And sprang forth as spark of glede. AChilles rides as a man mad, For his men was he not glad; He myght that tene no lenger thole, He brende In yre as any cole; When he herde hem so grysly grone, For hem he made moche mone: As lyoun rampyng forth he went, Wel Armed, out of his tent, To socoure his men and helpe his Danes. When he hem mette a-mong the Troyanes, He sclow hem faste as a tyraunt, Many a man made he criaunt; \u00b6 He slees & felles al that he metes, Thei falle thikkere than heryng fletes In-myddes the se In here scole. Alle men, thei knewe by his tole: His sword was other halff fote brode; Thorow the Troyens bodyis it glode. Thei knewe him that smot so sore, Alle were a-drad that were thore, \u00b6 Hic Achilles pugnauit cum Troianis. Whan thei saw that he cam. Off hem made he gret Marterdam: Euery forow Achilles filled, With dede bodies the erthe he hilled That he hadde sclayn In that stour, Sithe he was comen, In litel hour. \u00b6 Ther was kyng ne kny&yogh;t so gode, That thei ne fled as thei were wode; His noble sword, his bryght bronde, Was blody doun to his honde For men that he hadde ther sclawe, Off many a knyght broght he of dawe. He fferde as it were a deuel of helle, Lord! the peple that he gan qwelle! Thei flow tho ffro her tent & hale, In the diches thei hadde mochel bale. The Murimdones come anon, Now many Troyen to dethe gon; Thei sorwed & cried as thei were wode, Many walwes In his blode. THe Gregeis tho were glad & blythe And thonked her goddis offte sythe, That he was comen to that batayl. Troylus then gan him meruayl: \"What deuel In helle hit my&yogh;t be That made the Troyens so to fle?\" By his swerd he him ches, He wiste ther-by hit was Achilles That made his Troyens so to fle; Wod & wrothe thanne gan he be, Durste no man aske whi he were wroth, When he bare armes a&yogh;eyn his oth. \u00b6 As a lyoun rores, to him he cried, With hardy herte he him defied: \u00b6 Hic Achilles wlneratus est. 'In helle'\u2014seyde he\u2014'mot thow be loken! Hastow now thin owne othe broken? Thow hast euere ben a fals faytour, A losenger, a fals traytour! Were the fro me, I the defy, For if I may, thow schalt a-by!' He let his stede to him flyng Als harde as he myght slyng; And he to him with al his myght, For he at him hadde gret dispit \u00b6 For his wordes & his reueri Bothe of falsnes & losengeri That he on him bare; that he wolde proue: And ther-to he profered forth his gloue. Him hadde leuere than al that I can telle, That he my&yogh;t Troyle qwelle. STrong & stiff & hardi bothe Were the knyghtes that were wrothe: Eyther on other her speres poygned, Wel hard to-geder tho thei Ioyned, Her scheldis roff, here speres brast, The knyghtes bothe to grounde were cast, That nother of hem with-oute wounde Thei myght not rise nother hol ne sounde. \u00b6 Achilles for-sothe was euel hurt, Vpon his feet wel sone he sturt And drow his swerd as man of myght, And wolde haue sclawe that gentil knyght. But alle the Troyens on an hepe By-fore him than wel sone gan lepe, And doghti Troyle so thei defende That Achilles myght not come him hende, And ladde him home out of that place. Tho was it tyme to leue the chace, For hit was al atte nyght, And thei were weri of that fyght, That hem lust to take her rest; For that were thanne alther best. Achilles gan faste hamward gange; Many day afftir & lange Lay he seke In his bed; Off his wounde was he sore dred, For hit greued him so sore, He thoght to venge him efft ther-fore. THe Troyens thanne to MS. of . Troye &yogh;ede alle And Troylus to his fader halle, He tolde him of the deth of Brunes; Then were mad hidus tuynes Off many a gentil damysel For the deth of Gryme Gwynel. He tolde him also of the Iornay: \"How thei hadde fou&yogh;ten to-gedur that day, And how Gregeis were discomfith And foule put to the fly&yogh;t; And how thei felde her Pauylons, And scholde haue sclayn alle the Gryffons \u00b6 Er euen-tyde at his hopyng, Hadde thei had no socoryng Off doghti sir Achilles, That foule ferde among her pres;\"\u2014 'That Ilke knyght him-selff alone Maked oure men to fle echone For any thyng that we coude do, And made vs lese oure worschepe so.' \u00b6 When Priamus herde these tydandis\u2014 That Achilles a&yogh;eyn couenandis That he hadde made & hem be-het At that MS.

HEctuba was sore aschamed Off here lord that sche was blamed, Hir Angred sore that euere spak sche Ther-of wordes two or thre; Sche cursed offte his wickednesse, His gylrie and his falsnesse.

The kyng & quene were euel lykyng For that dede,\u2014by heuene kyng!

And thei of Grece when thei beheld How thei of Troy hadde taken the feld, Thei sente to hem her vanwarde With brode baneres & hye standarde; And thei come afftir with many a kny&yogh;t, With kynges & dukes of moche my&yogh;t, With many a louely fair pensel Off gold, of Inde, of fair sandel.

I wil therfore &yogh;ow not fode, We mot be-twene vs bere euen lode: &YOGH;iff &yogh;e the trewes assente to, &YOGH;e may hele &yogh;ow, and we also.' PRiamus seyde: 'iff my consayle These couenandes wil entayle, I schal acorde to here Iugement By gode a-surte and sacrament.' He wente fro hem out of that halle And called his men abouten him alle. \u00b6 He seide: 'lordynges, &yogh;e ben alle here, &YOGH;e are of my counseyl al plenere, And &yogh;e haue herd what these men aske. Telles me now sone In haste: Hope &yogh;e hit be oure profite To take suche trewe & respit? What schal I say to thes lordynges, These Messageres, these riche kynges?

Thei seyde alle: 'sir, we be a-vysed: Thei haue the trewe wel devysed, We graunte the trewes a&yogh;eyns vs.' 'And I for me'\u2014seyde Priamus. \u00b6 Priamus ran to halle a-valed, Ther these kynges to-gedur taled; He sayde: \"that he and his baronage Wolde graunte the terme by gode ostage A six monethe til thei were heled, By siker dedes wel asseled.\" He bad hem go sauely a&yogh;eyn And holde the trewes for-sothe certayn,\u2014 \u00b6 \"For he & his scholde by her othe Holde hem stable for leue or lothe;\" And bad: \"that thei scholde do so als, That thei were not founden fals; And that euery man with-oute debate Scholde gon & come erly and late With-outen robbyng or reuyng, With-oute any debate-makyng.\" These kynges swor bothe this\u2014 \"So god &yogh;eue hem Ioye and blis.\" Priamus &yogh;aff hem gode conge, To wende her way and wel be. NOw ride these kynges murily, To-gedir rydande Ioyfully; Thei are ful fayn that thei haue sped, Off no-thyng now are thei adrad. Vnto her tentis are thei reden; Thei haue ther not longe abyden, Thei hied hem to her Emperour, Ther he sat vndir his couertour. In his teldis thei him fond, Thei seyde: \"thei hadde ben on his sond, And that thei hadde wele done his nedis.\" And [he] hem blessed for her dedis; He asked: \"whether thei treweus hadde A six monethe, as he hem badde?\" And thei sayde: '&yogh;e, sir, sicurly! Thei schal be holden treuly \u00b6 The trewes stable a six monethe, On payne to lese bothe lym & lythe; And ther-to haue we hondes holden And truthis MS. thruthis . ply&yogh;t & fyngres folden.' The tydandes ran fro halle to halle, Eche man tolde other this tale: \"How here kynges haue ben at Troye And brou&yogh;t tydandes of moche Ioye, How thei scholde reste a wel gode while.\" Eche man thanne be-gan to smyle. AGamenoun than was wel glad, And so was euery lord & lad, And euery a knyght that vndirstandis The right sothe of these tythandes. Now euery man helis his soris, Euery man his tentis restoris Off mete & drynke & other store, Wel better than thei were ore. \u00b6 Thei were fayn of that grace Off her trewe so long a space, Vntil Achilles were y-couered. Many a lord ouer him houered Eche day him to solace; He gan Troyle faste manace. \u00b6 He seyde: \"when he hadde hele, That he wolde with Troy[l]e dele, He wolde not lette for al Fraunce But he tok of him vengaunce.\" Thei sayde: \"that Troyens were dissayued, And that thei nere not persayued To graunte the trewes when thei it asked, For thei scholde now be euel a-tasted, Thei graunt the trewes In the dismole. For were it so that he were hole, He scholde scle Troyle and alle thos other, As he hadde done Ector, his brother.\" WEle was hem thei scholde soiorne, It was for hem a noble turne: Thei gadered grases on eche halue, And made plastres & eke salue, Thei dyght here woundes that sore gored. Off mete & drynke thei ben wel stored, Thei played at the chesse & tables, And ete & drank and tolde fables. And alle the leches that crafftly were In al the ost that tyme there, \u00b6 Alle that coude of surgerye, Off Plasteres and of herberye,\u2014 Hadde Achilles In that cure To hele his woundes & his visure: Thei &yogh;aff to him wel gode kepyng To brynge him to his right slepyng, Thei made him drynkes of gode licour And broght a-&yogh;eyn his fair colour; \u00b6 Thei &yogh;aff him drynke many skyns, And heled him vp with medycyns, That he was hole, stalworthe, & fere In his strengthe & playn power, Er euere the trewes come fully out. Then were the Gregeis bolde & stout, \u00b6 Hic Troiani ordinauerunt magnum Bellum. Whan he was hole & &yogh;ede on fete. For tene his herte wex grete, That Troyle did him the vilony; He hadde to him gret envy, He swore by god that dwelled In heuene He scholde him scle for odde or euene. AChilles is hol & clene In my&yogh;t, Bold and strong, semely In sy&yogh;t, For he is hol In flesch & fel, And as hole as any pykerel. Hit drawes faste vnto that day, That thei most nede leue her play And bygynne a&yogh;eyn the werre, For no man may ther-fro hem sterre; Vntil that on for ay & euere Be al for-done, thei blyn neuere. \u00b6 Euery man ordeynes now his gere, Sadel, & bridel, & stalworthe spere, Fresche atyre, wel gode newe helmes, And made hem gode staues of oke & elmes Ful of warres and of knottis, Piked staues with heuy bottis. Achilles thinkes day & nyghtis, How he may sle dou&yogh;ti kny&yogh;tis; He nolde it lette for non au&yogh;t That any man him &yogh;eue mau&yogh;t. WHen the trewes were alle gone, And th[e]i were heled euerychone, And day was comen thei scholde fyght, And thei were rysen & redy dight,\u2014 Eche man In his armure On gode stedis, be &yogh;e sure!\u2014 The Troyens ride to Ilyon; Kyng Philomene & Mennon, Odeman & Eueas, Antenor and Palamydas, And eche a lord &yogh;ede with his ost; And alle men houed then a-cost \u00b6 Aboute Ilyon, that riche palais, To here what Troyle to hem says: \"How he here batayles wolde devise, In what manere and what wyse; Ho schal haue the vaunwarde, Who the myddel, and ho the rerewarde?\" So were thei redi In that mornyng, Al redi dyght by sone rysyng. DOghti Troyle faste him payned That thei were wel ordeyned; When thei were ordeyned wele & clene, He bad hem go forth al be-dene, Euery lord with his Eschele, And come a&yogh;eyn with Ioye & hele. The &yogh;ate was than vndone & opone That we by-fore hadde of y-spoken, That &yogh;ate was cleped Dardanydes: Ther was of kny&yogh;tes mechel pres, \u00b6 At the &yogh;ates thei outward issed, As doughti Troyle hem hadde wissed; Thei ride to-gedir vpon a rase Toward Gregeis a gode pase, Til thei were comen nye here lystes. Thei houed stille at here tristes, Til thei se Gregeis oute comande With brode baneres a-boute wayvande. \u00b6 Troyle now rides and his Troyanes With his burgeis & Cite&yogh;aynes Out off Troye\u2014alas the wo! For he schal dye, er he then come ffro. Alas Troye! what is thi grace? To the fel neuere gode trace, To the fel neuere gode chaunce, Ne non of alle thi retenaunce! Thoow thow be gay & glorious, Thow were euere Some letters erased between were and euere. on-gracious! Off thow hede of Cites were, Blysful hap to the fel neuere! For better men were neuere lyuand, Than were that tyme to the longand; And &yogh;it was it here alther schap, That thei died alle by myshap. \u00b6 Ther-fore I trowe In my thoght: A&yogh;ens godis wille so were thei MS. we. wroght. Hadde destyne ben Ector frende, Or doghti Troylus that was so hende, The Gregeis nad not hem sclayn; But destene turned hem a&yogh;eyn, Destyne was here enemy And sclow hem bothe vnhappily. And also died alle that other kynde Off gode men that were In mynde. THe Gregeis saw the Troiens come Out of Troye alle on a throme, Armed wel In her maneres, With faire penseles & brode baneres. The wannward than to hem thei sende, The Middelward MS. Mildelward. come afterhende MS. asterhende. , The rerwarde dwelled lange. But when Achilles scholde out gange, \u00b6 He gart his men vnto him calle; And when thei stode aboute him alle, He sayde to hem with glad chere: '&YOGH;e ar my frendes leue & dere, \u00b6 Hic ibant ad prelium. I wot wel &yogh;e loue me mechel With trewe herte & no-thyng fikel, And to do my byddyng are &yogh;e meke; Now for my loue I &yogh;ow be-seke: To my sawe &yogh;e &yogh;eue good tent, And beth to me obedient. \u00b6 &YOGH;e wot wel what affray I toke of Troyle that other day, Wiche an harm and a wounde; And how I fel vpon the grounde; Bode I neuere scuche a dispit. Now helpis me that it were qwit; But I be venged of that boy, In myn herte gete I neuere Ioy. THer-fore for my loue I &yogh;ow pray That &yogh;e do as I &yogh;ow say: That &yogh;e this day &yogh;eue no gome To kyng ne kny&yogh;t MS. knytt , but the scribe has tried to alter the first t to &yogh;. ne to grome, Man to sle ne to take, Ne non assaut to non make,\u2014 But beth besi on alle thing, How &yogh;e may him among &yogh;ow bryng! \u00b6 When &yogh;e thedir comen are And &yogh;e of him may be ware, Be-closes him al a-boute That he fro &yogh;ow go not oute, And stondis a-boute him on a throme That non of his may to him come Him to defende fro myn hond. Ful stille aboute &yogh;it &yogh;e stond, And lete vs two oure myght schewe; And I schal that boy al to-hewe. But loke that no man to vs come, That fro my hand that he be nome; \u00b6 Hic preliauerunt. I schal him ful wel qwite That his spere did on me bite, And thus may I haue my wille That foule boy for to spille. \u00b6 Ther-fore I pray &yogh;ow alle\u2014 For any thyng that may be-falle, And as I am &yogh;oure a[l]ther lord\u2014 That &yogh;e be alle at this acord And &yogh;if to no-thyng elles kepe.' And with that word Achilles wepe,\u2014 So wolde he fayn on him be venged. The batayles ben to-gedir renged, Thei of Troye & thei of Grece; Thei hewe here bodies al to pece, Thei did gret sorwe & mechel wo, Whan thei gan to-gedir go. THe stoure is styff & strong be-gonnen, Euery man on other is ronnen, Thei haue her speres brosten & broken, Ful ffewe wordes ther were spoken; At that tyme were many kastoun A-&yogh;eyn the grounde that al to-brastoun, Ther died many at that torpel. But then come Troyle, y-armed wel, With mechel peple of Armed kny&yogh;tes Come he thedir at that ri&yogh;tes; With scheld enbrased & spere enbossed A-mong the Gregeis he ran & pressed: That he to ran, dethe was his dome; Wel euel was he thedir wel-come. \u00b6 When Troyle hadde broken his spere, He toke his swerd that wel coude schere, It was trenchaund & wel poynted, With Gregeis blod it was anoynted Fro the poynt to the hilte, Ful many Gregeis hadde it spilte. He rased scheldes ffro here neckes, He teres the mayles as it were sekkes, \u00b6 He bare hem doun to grounde al fflat, He &yogh;aff hem many a sori sqwat MS. sq wat. ; He droff doun alle that come him by, As doth bestes that ben hungry. Thei were noght to him worth a schelle, He blan neuere to scle & felle Fro he come thedir to the mydday, That thei fro him ffled a-way; Thei fled echon by on red, And elles thei hadde ben alle ded. HIt was a litel be-fore the none, A-boute mydday, that this was done That thei of Grece ffro Troyle fled, So were thei of his strokes dred. But Achilles ne none of hese Were comen not to that purprese; But when he herde hem criande, He loked & sey hem fleande, He saw hem flee fro that purprise, He bad his men be war & wyse. He was y-armed at alle rightes, Strong & hole In alle his myghtes; \u00b6 He tok his swerd that was so gode, Hit wolde bite as it were wode, Ther was none suche hard ne towe; Many a Troyen ther-with he sclowe. He bad his men: \"so mote thei thee\"\u2014 'Socoures now hem that now dothe fle! Helpis now, for thei haue nede!' Achilles than to hem &yogh;ede, \u00b6 He bad his men thenk on his spellis And attende to [no] man ellis; And thei bad him be not abayst,\u2014 \"But on him he scholde trayst.\" He passed forth with his meyne And socoured hem that he saw fle, Thei mette the Troyens In her wyse Thei bare hem doun at the burdise. \u00b6 Achilles and his Murimdones Socoured alle her Gryffones; For by her help and her comyng Thei were tho lettid In her chasyng, And Gregis keuered a-&yogh;eyn the feld And made good visage with spere & scheld To her enemys ful boldely And fau&yogh;t with hem apertly t very indistinctly inserted over line. . GRegais turned and gete the place, For Troyens were let of here chace. The Murimdones for-&yogh;ete no-thyng What was her lordes faire praying: Among Troyens bothe ner & fer Thei loked aboute In euery corner Off that batayle afftir sir Troyle, Iff thei saw owqher that kny&yogh;t royle. So were Thei war where he stode Scleande Gregeis as he were wode: \u00b6 He was that tyme hi[m]-selff alone, Off hyse that tyme with him were none; Him faste ffyghtand alone thei founde Opon the Gregais In that stounde. Thanne wente aboute him alle that frape, That he my&yogh;t no-wayes skape, And made a scheltrone him aboute And spered him fro alle his route. \u00b6 Hic Achilles occidit Troylum. Off Gryffons come ther many a kny&yogh;t And halp the Murimdones with her my&yogh;t. \u00b6 Achilles\u2014lord! that he was glad! Off alle the world no more he bad! He come ridande on his stede, Off sir Troyle toke he gode hede How he sclow doun right his men That thei lay dede In the fen. 'Turne the'\u2014he seyde\u2014'fals gadelyng! Thow schalt now dye\u2014by heuene kyng! My dispite schaltow sore abigge! Kepe the fro me! I the sigge.' \u00b6 Thei drow her swerdes that were gode And hew to-gedir as thei were wode, The rede blod ran by here side, Thei made hem woundes longe & wyde: Achilles hewys In-two his mayles, The rede blod afftir rayles; He hew the helme al of his hede, His scheld sone he him be-reued. But Troyle defendis him by his my&yogh;t With al his strengthe, that gentil kny&yogh;t. BVt Achilles was so strong That he my&yogh;t not endure long,\u2014 No man myght to him come For Murimdones that stode athrome, The Gregeis also with al here myght[es] Passyng twenty thousand knyghtes. \u00b6 Troyle was wery y seems to be corrected from i. , he myght not sitte, He was al faynt & out of witte For the blod that he gan blede, Tho fel he doun of his stede. Achilles tho lyght glad ynow And his noble swerd out-drow \u00b6 Lamentacio Troianorum. And smot his hed fro the body And throw MS. drow. it away dispitously; He tyed his body at his hors tayl And drow him tho thorow the batayl. \u00b6 Achilles has sir Troyle sclayn, And ther-of he is wonder fayn; Michel schame & vylony Did he tho that dede body: He tied him at his hors ers And drow him ouer myre & Mers, Thorow her ost & her batayle He drow him at his hors tayle\u2014 As he hadde ben a cut-purs, Ne my&yogh;t he him haue don no wors. \u00b6 When it was told sir Palidomas idomas written by another hand on erasure. , Antenor, & sir Eueas,\u2014 And his brother sir Paris When he herde telle of this, He myght not speke no MS. speken o. word, but swoun, Among hem alle tho fel he doun. \u00b6 The Troyens than hadde sorwe y-now, When thei saw how he him drow, Thei ran on the Grues alle on a res To reue sir Troyle ffro Achilles. But thei of Grece so with-stode With egre wil & sturdy mode, That thei myght not the Gregeis twyn Ne that body fro hem wyn. A wonder stoure and a cruel Be-gan thei thanne & a mortel, For alle the Troyens ther-aboute Gadered hem vpon a route, The ded body fro him to reue; But Gregeis wolde it not leue. Achilles cleues alle her bones, For sorwe thei crye & bitterly grones. \u00b6 But when Mennon, that noble kyng, Off Troyle herde this tydyng, Whan he wyste that he was sclayn And thorow that ost so foule drawyn,\u2014 An hundrid sithe he seyde 'alas!' So was him wo that he ded was: \"Alas!\"\u2014seyde he that tyme & tyde\u2014 \"That euere scholde he that day a-byde To se so noble a doghti knyght Be so distroyed & foule dyght!' With sore herte thorow alle that prese Cried Mennon to Achilles, \u00b6 When he was comyn to him neye; He sayde: 'traytour, I the defye! To thi MS. his. hors tayl that knyght to bynde, In thi foule herte how myght thow fynde? And drawe him thorow bekke & broke That gentil kny&yogh;t that thow so toke, That was so gode of vasselage MS. basselage. , Off dou&yogh;tines & of corage! Ware the, traytour, now for me! By him that made leff on tre: Thow schalt him no further drawe With-oute harm for loue ne awe!' LOrd, that Achilles was wode! That alle tho chaunged his blode! That he sette him so at noght, He thoght it scholde be dere a-boght; He smot tho kyng Mennon a-&yogh;eyn With al his power & his mayn, And kyng Mennon to him with that; But Achilles In his sadel sat. But thorow his scheld & Aketoun He smot Achilles In that raundoun; \u00b6 Achilles was sore aschamed And of that dede foule a-gramed, Opon his swerd his hond he layde And swere by othe and seyde: \"That he scholde doun for leue or lothe!\"\u2014 And therto Achilles swor his othe. \u00b6 Achilles smot that kny&yogh;t sore, That he fel doun of his hors thore Opon the grounde In a ded swone, And of his hors he fel a-doune. The Troyens than fro him wan; But &yogh;it ther died many a man With dynt of sword In that batayle, Thei suffred ther ful mechel trauayle. THe while thei were at this fight, The Troyens with strengthe & myght Troylus body a-way thei stale As faste as thei myght hale, Til it was stolen out of that ost, Vndir a dike layde a-cost. Than gan these ostis parte atwynne, For of that fyghtyng wold thei blynne MS. thei not blynne. ; And kyng Mennon a hors was brou&yogh;t, But arst with Troyens was hit ful tou&yogh;t. \u00b6 But it was euen, they my&yogh;t not dwelle, Thei departed, as I &yogh;ow telle: Hit was ney the euenyng, The sonne was ney at his settyng; And bothe parties hamward drow, For thei hadde foghten long y-now. The Gregeis &yogh;ede to here tentis; And Paris vp that body hentes, And a-none hamward gan royle, And ledde with him the body of Troyle. THei haue her fyght for this day ent; And thei of Troy hamward went, The dede body with hem thei ledde, Al of blod it is be-bled. At euery temple the belles ronge, Euery man wepe, and no man songe; And ther-by wiste alle tho of Troye That some of heres were dede & foye. Philomene & kyng Mennon That body bar to Ylion, And alle the Troyens on a rowe With loude criyng and moche harrowe. \u00b6 When thei of Troye hadde herd that cry, Thei asked \"how?\"\u2014the chesoun whi Thei cried so and wepe so sore\u2014 \"And what he was that thei bare thore? Iff he were lord of gret renoun? Or any kyng of any regioun?\" And thei answered & seyde a-&yogh;eyn: \"That it was Troyle that ther was sclayn.\" \u00b6 When thei of Troye the sothe wiste, Ther was wrongen many a ffiste. 'Alas'\u2014thei seide\u2014'now he is ded, Now are we alle with-outen red!' Thei wyste tho to lese her lyues, Bothe here children & here wyues, And alle the godis euere thei aught; Off here lyues tho rou&yogh;te thei naught. \u00b6 The sorwe that the fadir made! Ther was no man that him myght glade. Out off sorwe was not the quene, Ne his suster Pollexene. Sche made for him sorwe y-now, For dele hir body al to-drow, Hir louely heer sche al to-rent, Sche cracched hir face & al to-schent,\u2014 That it was ruthe & gret pite So fair a lyff so dyght to se. \u00b6 In gret mornyng was dame Heleyn, When sche wiste sir Troyle sclayn; And his brother, sir Paris, Gret sorwe made he y-wis: He sorwed bothe day & ny&yogh;t. And so did euery lord & kny&yogh;t, And alle that euere were In the toun; For thei seide alle: \"thei were a-doun,\"\u2014 And al the nyght til the morwe Lyued thei In gret sorwe. \u00b6 But the Gregeis were wel glad; Lord, the Ioye that thei mad That her strong fo was sclayn! Lord, that thei therfore were fayn! Thei sclepe al ny&yogh;t and made blythe, And thonked her god offte sithe, And solaced Achilles thei also For that prowesse that he hadde y-do. \u00b6 When day was comen, and ny&yogh;t gon, Thei toke her hors euerychon chon on erasure, but by the same hand. And rod a&yogh;eyn In-to the feldis, Out of the toun & of the teldis; And be-gan a newe assaut, Til hit was fer with-Inne the naut. WHen it was day, & thei sei lyght, And thei were armed & redi dyght, Out of Troye rod the Troyanes; A-&yogh;eyn hem come alle the Danes, \u00b6 Hic Pugnabant per vij tem dies. Wel arayed on horse rydande, With fair scheld & spere In hande. Many a man ther strokes toke, That many of hem her lyff for-soke; Many a body was ther to-koruen, And many gode kny&yogh;t was ther storuen. \u00b6 And thus ferde thay til it was nyght, That thei of sonne had no syght, That thei most nede take her rest. On morwe were thei al prest That ffyght a&yogh;eyn to be-gynne; For that wolde thei neuere blynne, Vnto that on were for-done,\u2014 And that scholde now be sone. \u00b6 And thus ffau&yogh;t thei to-gedur samen\u2014 Alle on ernest & not on gamen\u2014 With-oute rest dayes seuene; But alle her dedis may no man neuene, For that wolde be to longe dwellyng, To moche werk of my tellyng: For who-so wolde aboute that dwelle Alle her dedis for to telle, Many bokes myght men make; I wol not now vndirtake.\u2014 \u00b6 But seuene dayes with-outen pes, With-oute rest\u2014so saith Dares\u2014 Fau&yogh;t thei to-gedir day for day, Saue Achilles In his bed lay To hele the woundes that he hadde cau&yogh;t, When he & Mennon to-gedir fau&yogh;t Off that fyght that thei hadde meled. The seuenthe day whan he was heled Off his woundes wel & fyn, Off his Angwys & his pyn, \u00b6 Incipit bellum In die septimo. He Armed him as other did, To go & fyght the Gregeis myd. \u00b6 Then were the Gregeis bold & glad; Alle his men tho faire he bad Some letters erased after bad . , That when thei come to that batayle, That thei scholde alle Mennon assayle And close him alle envyroun, That him myght helpe no man; And &yogh;iff to no man elles entent, But that he were amonges hem hent, That he myght do hem wreche, And sle him for his s on erasure. last speche, And for he woundid him so sore\u2014 He swore: \"he scholde do so na more MS. namore . .\" \u00b6 And therfore he bad his men not fayle To helpe him wele In that batayle; Thei bad him holde him stille, Hit scholde be done at his wille. HIT was opon the day seuend, Achilles thoght he wolde be euend Vpon the doghti kyng Mennoun. He bad her kynges & Agamenoun: \"That he scholde the Gregeis aray, To se that day qwat thei do may?\"\u2014 'For I my-selff that day schal lede The formast warde, so god me spede!' \u00b6 Agamenoun tho hem arayed,\u2014 With baneres brode alle displayed,\u2014 And bad echon thei scholde hem hye Forward with her companye, For thei of Troye were comen alle And with-outen her Cite walle In-to the feld, to take her stale, With many riche amerale. \u00b6 Kyng Mennoun the vamwarde ledis, Vnto Achilles he him spedis; When he saw him be-fore comande, He hied to him faste ridande: Rode thei to-gedir with gret envy As faste as thei myght fly, Ayther smot other In-myddes the scheld, That bothe fley on the feld Fro her horses to the grounde, That nother was with-outen wounde. \u00b6 But thei lepe vp & fau&yogh;t on fote, For tho was hem no more bote: But Mennon was his men with-oute, Here horses ran fro hem a-boute; Ther was no man to him &yogh;aff gome, Kyng ne sqwyer, kny&yogh;t ne grome. TRoyens mette & the Gryffons With sword & spere & gret burdons, With piked staues wel y-wrythen. Ther was a fyght strong y-&yogh;euen: On bothe parties thei died thikke, But thei schal leue non qwyk, Many a schanke brake thei In-sonder, And many lay his hors fet vnder; Ech-on other smot & quelled That thikke to grounde ded thei felled. \u00b6 Many an hed was al to-squat MS. alto squat . , And many ded on his hors sat; Some loste nose, & some her tonges, Som her lyuer, & som her longes.

Thei holde hem oute with gret fyght And sclow the Troiens doun right. \u00b6 Achilles and Mennoun fau&yogh;t In-fere, The strokes myght men fer here; The knyghtes were bothe gode & strong, But her fyght myght not dure long: But Mennoun woundes Achilles sore, But Achilles did him wel more, Thei fau&yogh;t to-gedir as thei were wode, Bothe thei ran al on blode. \u00b6 Mennon scheld is al to-hewe, He cutte his mayles rewe on rewe, With his blod-brode bronde He hewe his scheld to his honde: Mennon was faynt for many wounde, Achilles smot him doun to grounde, He cleue his hede to his brest, He bad him lye ther & rest. MEnnoun is ded, and that is harm; He lithe ded In his blod warm. Troyens bere him a-way thore, Thei were tho agast sore.

Thei sclow the Troyens many on And wounded also gret won; But alle that hadde space to fle Flow In-to Troye, the strong Cite, And spered the &yogh;ates with keye & lokke To kepe out the Gregeis folke. \u00b6 The Cite &yogh;ates are sperd & stoken, That thei be not on hem broken; And thei wente alle In-to her Innes.

For eche man cares now for his lyff, For his children, & for his wiff. For Mennoun kyng were thei sori, Ther was non that he ne was drery. \u00b6 Now is Ector ded, and Dephebus, Troyle also the vigorous, And sir Mennoun, the doghti kyng. \"Alas, Alas!\" thei gan to syng, For hem is lefft none but Paris, Now of Troye is litel Prys.

A precious tombe for Troyle was wroght, And his body ther-In was broght; And leyde him ther-In bischopis thre With wonder gret solempnite: Ther was for him a riche offerynges Off Erles, Dukes, and of kynges. \u00b6 In the MS. the next line (15254) is standing here, after this sign. And Priamus made also Another tombe Menoun vnto, And did his men ther-Inne him brynge With fair seruice & gret offrynge.

PAris than answered & sayde: 'Mi dere Moder, I holde me payde Off &yogh;oure biddyng & &yogh;oure consayl; Hit schal be done with-oute fayl.' On morwe erly, whan it was day, Paris thanne with-oute delay Wente to the temple, and ther him hid With twenti armed kny&yogh;tes myd That were hardy & wondir strong, To scle Achilles hem among. \u00b6 The sonne schon, the day was cler, Hectuba sente hir Messanger Afftir that kny&yogh;t, sir Achilles, And bad him faire: \"whil it was pes, Come swithe home to hir house, And he scholde haue to his spouse Pollexene, that semely may, That he so moche loued ay.\" \u00b6 When Achilles these tydynges herde, With mochel Ioye & murthe he ferde, For he was so with hir loue bounden: Thoow he hadde of rede gold founden An hundrid thousand pounde, He hadde not ben so glad that stounde As he was thanne\u2014I vndirstande,\u2014 When he herde this tythande. \u00b6 Qualiter Achilles fuit occisus. \u00b6 He called as sone vnto him tho Duk Nestor sone MS.

For thow schalt for thi vilonye, For thi falshede & cowardye That thow sir Troyle so foule slowe, Die this day, yff that we mowe.' AChilles saw he was dissayued: Fro his necke his mantel he wayued, And a-boute his Arme he caste, And with his hond he held it faste; And smot a knyght amonges hem alle And made him his swerd to falle. His felawe was sclayn lyghtly, But Achilles tho fau&yogh;t myghtly, And ten of tho that him assayled He sclow, er his herte fayled. \u00b6 But Paris stod fro his meyne, And In his hond held dartes thre And kest hem at Achilles Ther he fau&yogh;t In-myddes the pres, \u00b6 Hic Achilles Interfectus fuit. And wounded him, as he fau&yogh;t thore, In his body with hem ful sore. And nad Paris so him wounded, Alle his knyghtes hadde he comfonded With his manhoud With on erasure, but by the same hand; in manhoud something has been altered, it seems to have been like . . . hond . , & thorow his my&yogh;tes He hadde sclayn the .xx ti . kny&yogh;tes. But he hadde than many a wounde, Tho fel he ded vpon the grounde. \u00b6 Whan he was ded, thei him to-coruen; When Paris saw that he was storuen, He bad hem take him by the leggis And throwe him ouer In-to the seggis And let him ligge to roke & rauen; He swor: \"he scholde neuere be grauen, But he scholde to houndes mete, And rokis & rauenys him scholde ete.\" BVt when that the quene Helayn Wyste that thei were so slayn, Sche come rennande thedir blyue And sir Paris sche gan to schryue; Sche prayed for loue & curtasye: \"He scholde not do that vylonye To that kny&yogh;t that was alosed.\" So sche spak & so sche glosed, That he bad men scholde him lay Somwhere In Troye In an hye way, That euery man that likyng hadde Might hem be-holden & be gladde, \u00b6 Whan thei saw ded that ilke body That was that mortel enemy.

Thei sayde tho: \"thei hadde no drede Off the Gregays ne of her dede, For thei scholde neuere the Cite wynne, Sithe he was ded her trust was Inne.\" \u00b6 And thus was Achilles done to ded Thorow a wicked woman red, Thorow her sleght & consayl Died the knyght with-oute fayl. And so hath many a-nother man Died thorow red of a womman: That neuere were so gode knyghtes Off ffairnes, of connyng, ne of myghtes, \u00b6 The beste body that euere ete bred Thorow fals wymmen haue ben ded. And so did Achilles, the strong knyght, Thorow a womman lost al his myght; And sche ther-afftir sclayn was For the deth of Achilles.

AGamenoun, her Emperour, He sente to Troye a procuratour, Lordis, kny&yogh;tis, & squyeres, And bad the kyng, for her prayeres, And also to sir Paris, To graunte hem tho two bodyes To grauen hem the moldes vndir, That men on hem no more wondir. \u00b6 Priamus graunt the kynges bone And seyde: \"her wil scholde be done,\" And escused him of that dede, Bothe of assent and of rede; He bad thei scholde hem hom lede.

Tho toke thei be-twene hem grithe To be In pes a two monethe, To reste her bones that were weri By assent of bothe parti. \u00b6 The trewes was take monethes two, That non of hem schal other mysdo Lastande the trewes a nedle worth: The relykes are y-broght forth, And thei are sworne & made ther othe, Thei schal hem hadde for leue or lothe. \u00b6 The Gregais alle toke consayl to wende, That thei wolde afftir Pirrus sende \u00b6 Hic Greci mandauerunt post Pirrum ffilium Achillis. To the kyng sir Lycomede, To help hem In that gret nede,\u2014 That was so tyff & strong In stoure. Agamenoun, here Emperoure, Bad than his brother Menelaus With his meygne wende afftir Pirrus; And he as sone wente to the see With his men & his naue, And sayled forth with mochel spede Vn-to that lord Lycomede. \u00b6 When he was comen In-to that hauen, He bad sqwyeres, &yogh;omen, & knauen Lede out here hors opon the sonde; And he lepe vp & rode to londe, With Lycomede til he was met: With curtais wordis he him gret And welcomed him with loueli chere, And sette hem doun to-gedir In-fere In his hye halle opon the dese. Then seyde the kyng Lycomedes: 'SIr kyng, to me welcome thow art! But me meruayles what [t]he has gart Come fro thi Grues thus fer to me? And what thow wole In this contre? What tydandes haue &yogh;e broght hidur? And what thow wol with the haue thidur? For wele I wot: with-oute skille Art thow not comen this lond tille.' \u00b6 Menelaus to him then sayde: 'Sir Licomede, so thow be payde! I schal the telle myn erande, whi That I come hedir sicurly: The kynges of Grece alle In-fere The gretes wele, as thow seis here, Bothe by mouthe & eke by letter, And sayn that it were moche better, Child Pirrus, that thow holdest here In vn-manhed & foule manere, To send to hem & to his kyn MS. And to hem & to his kyn. , And loos & worschipe to wyn, \u00b6 To venge his fader on his Enemys, When he were man of loos & pris; And be his fader fomen bane, The order of kny&yogh;t when he hadde tane, And not to ligge thus In scolcurye. Hit is, sir kyng, a vylonye To the, sir, and to him bothe, The kynges of Grece with the are wrothe; And thow him holdis as brid In cage, That he wynnes him no vasselage, But leses his time & his loos, And helpis hem not a&yogh;eyn here foos, As him by skyl au&yogh;t for to do. And thus bad thei me say the to.' LIcomede wex blo of blod, When he these wordes vndirstod; 'Off god'\u2014sayde he\u2014'I take witnesse, On no wise long on me non isse That he hath dwelled so longe fro &yogh;ow: For I wiste neuere whi ne how I myght him sende, ne by what man; Ne he him-selff the way ne can. \u00b6 But sithen the kynges for him haue sent, And thow thi-selff [art] here present, Child Pirrus, I the be-teche Thi fader deth to gete wreche. He[r] by the hand I the him bede, Ouer the see with the to lede \u00b6 Hic venit Pirrus ad Grecos. Vnto the lordis & kynges alle. I pray to god, that fair mot &yogh;ow falle.' MEnelaus when he herde that, He was Ioyful ther he sat; Him thoght his herte wel hesed, Whan he of him was feffed & sesed. He thoght no lenger ther to dwelle, He hadde no tale lenger to telle; He toke his leue at him to go To hem of Grece that he come fro. \u00b6 He bad god that made sonne & mone, Brynge hem thedir sound & sone; And thei to-gedir verament Vn-to the see thei ben y-went. When thei were comen to her schippis, Eche man afftir other In hippis; And drow vp Anker & her ropes, And caste on hem cloke & copes To saue hem fro the salt water, That it be-sprenged not her hater. \u00b6 Thei sayled bothe day & nyght With spede & haste that thei myght Ouer strem & ouer wawe, Vn-til thei stonde before hem sawe Off trusti Troye the hye walles, Here gaye toures, & her halles; On hem schon the sonne bem. Thei sayled forth ouer that strem, Til thei were come to here flote; Thei wente to londe tho by her bote, \u00b6 Thei leue her schippis & gon to londe And riden to-gedir hond In honde, Til thei come to here Pauylons Among the Grues and the Gryffons. AMong the Gregais Pirrus is lyght A fair man, hardi, & wyght; Many a lord Pirrus by-held, Whan he was broght to that teld: Thei were echon for him ful glad, Hem thoght that thei his fader had With hem a-&yogh;eyn, so was he lyche To his fader\u2014by heuene ryche! \u00b6 Agamenoun, her Emperour, And alle the lordis did him honour, And did him worschepe ther he stode, And welcomed him with chere gode. The Murundones come to him than, And welcomed him, euery man; Ioyful & glad thei with him wore, That he hem was comen thore. \u00b6 Agamenoun as sone gan brynge Al his fader richesse & rynge: Pauelons, tentis, & his teldis, Stedis, speres, helmys, & scheldis, And al his gode fair Armure, And clothes of gold, fyne & pure, Off say, of silk, bothe red & grene,\u2014 And &yogh;aff hem Pirrus al be-dene. The morwe Afftir thei made him kny&yogh;t, Richely was he dubbed & dy&yogh;t. \u00b6 Ayax Thelamaneus Off hem was most glorious, He gyrd his sword aboute his swire And sayde to him: 'Pirrus, leue sire! I gird the with thi sword, take hede To venge thi fader as thow most nede. And moche Ioye haue thow of thin ordur of kny&yogh;t, As thi fader hadde that venged vs In fy&yogh;t.' Two lordes of Grece, princes, skete Set his spores on his fete, That were of gold, pure & ffyn. Then my&yogh;t men here a mechel dyn Off Trompes, pipes, & other glues Among the Gregais & the Grues. Gret was the murthe & the melody That ther was of Menstralcy; \u00b6 The Grues held gret feste & strong Many dayes afftir and long, And made gret Ioye & solace ce very small on erasure. In worschipe of him that newe kny&yogh;t was. PIrrus is knyght gode & gay, Off ffair porture, of gode aray, Off wel riche apparayle, Off gentil blod, of fair entayle; He prayes tho his Murundones That thei go sette here Pauylones, As thei were wont to stande The while his fader was lyuande. And thei on to-geder went And did her lordes comandement; And his tentis tho thei maked, Faste & sekirly thei hem staked In-to the erthe with lyne & cordes; And sette his tentis by other lordes. \u00b6 And whiles the trues last A-qwynted with the kny&yogh;tes fast, In fair manere & gode beryng He was a-qweynt with euery kyng, Er euere the trewes was fully ent; But it is ney verament, &YOGH;e that thei be-twene hem set The trewes to holde as thei be-het. THe trewes are past with-oute faile, And day is comen of here batayle: Thei buske hem faste & bowes bende, Vnto the fyght a&yogh;eyn to wende. Pirrus In his fader wede That vaunwarde that day he dos lede, \u00b6 He hath his batayle wel arayed Off men byfore offte assayed; He is wel dight & horsed als, His fader scheld aboute his hals And Achilles swerd also,\u2014 Many man to dethe ther-with was do,\u2014 \u00b6 His armes Are stronge & sicur. And he with that rides In-to that bicur, He passes forth ouer the dikes With his men that wel him likes, And takes the fel[d] brod & large Couered vndir helm MS. him . & targe. And euery a-nother kyng With alle her men In her ledyng, Knyght & sqwyer, erle & swayn, Rode & &yogh;ede vn-to that playn Ther thei were wont for to fyght, With thosandes sixti two & eyght. \u00b6 Ther was the duk Menescene With alle his men, & kyng Chelene, So was the kyng Menelaus, And Ayax Thelemaneus, Dux Nestor, & Vlixes, And the doghti Diomedes, Theseus kyng, & Thelamon, And the Emperour Agameon, Polinytes, & kyng Thoas: Tho rod thei forth on a pas, Euery a lord with his ost, Proudly pyght lest and most. \u00b6 And thei of Troye were comen out With-oute drede or any dout, Off here enemys hadde thei no drede. Bothe the parties to-gedur &yogh;ede, A wicked werre thei ther by-gan, Thei sclow ten thousand, er thei blan. NOw are thei to-gedir samen, Alle on ernest & not on gamen; Now are thei to-gedir broght, A woful day schal ther be wroght: The speremen ride, the bowemen schote, Thei fel faste ded at horses fote, The swordmen smyte & strokes &yogh;eue, Helmes breke, & scheldes cleue. \u00b6 Lordes & laddes lesen her lyues, Echon other rendis & ryues; A bitter bale haue thei be-gonne, Now this folk to-gedir is ronne. Ther were bowes al to-broken MS. alto broken. , Stedis stiked & thorow-stoken, Helmes holed, & heuedis houen, Knees & cropes with knyues clouen, Schonkes schyuered, schuldres schorne, Blodi burnes In bostis borne; With ferli fare tho freykes ferde, Off suche an hepe neuere I herde. \u00b6 Pirrus prikes aboute & praunses, Fro man to man aboute he launses Al his strengthe for to assay, He dud gret harm on hem that day; His fader Armes that day he bare. Off Palamides so was he ware A-&yogh;eyn the Gryffons fyghtyng faste, Grues & Gregais doun he caste. \u00b6 He turned his stede to him sone, He thoght on him to wynne his schone: He rode to him with so gret haste That al his spere In-sunder braste, That he fel doun opon the grounde And hadde a wel greuous wounde. His gode sword sone he drow, He wol him take if he mow, Or of his hand ther be sclayn; Ther-to putte he al his mayn. \u00b6 But that be-held kyng Philomene, He saw the fyght hem be-twene; He saw the kny&yogh;t Palamydes e seems to be altered to a . In gret perel of Pirrus was, For that newe kny&yogh;t Pirrus Was with him ful noyus, For he thoght him so mate & make, That he scholde scle him or take. But Philomene hit myght not thole: To Pirrus turned he his fole, And led with him al his meyne\u2014 Two thousandes kny&yogh;tes & hundres thre,\u2014 And put Pirrus fro his euel wille, That he ne scholde his falawe spille Ne that tyme him not dere, For no-thyng that he myght swere. PIrrus for-sothe hadde gret dispit That he fro him scholde be quyt, With Philomene was he wrothe: He leues that other and to him gothe, With tene of herte kepte he that kyng, And toke him thanne In suche a swyng That he bar him tayl ouer top, That he lay ther as a sop. \u00b6 Then my&yogh;t men here a wondir cry Off alle his men stode him by, For Pirrus wolde her lord haue, And thei wolde him fayn saue: Thei wol ther her lyues stende, But thei may here lord defende; Thei put hem certes In gret perel To saue her lord In that torpel. But al was not that thei coude do, For thei no-wyse myght come him to, For Murundones were so wode That thei her strengthe styffly with-stode. PAlidomas come thanne rennande, And al his ost with wepen in hande, To socoure & helpe kyng Philomene, As he did him In his gret tene; But he myght not ffor that he couthe, For al that he was kny&yogh;t In his &yogh;outhe, He myght not saue him fro her handis, That thei ne him toke & putte In bandis To lede him to Pirrus tent. But of her purpos were thei rent, For that louely lady fre Qwit him out of here pouste. \u00b6 The stour was fel & strong, The hilles of here strokes rong: Pantasalye come thedur than With many hardy kene womman, A sterne stede the quene be-strode, Among the Gregays that lady rode; Sche sclow & felde many & fele,\u2014 The sothe to say and not to hele. Hir armes were white as swannes flawe; The Grues hir dredde whan thei hir sawe, For sche on hem gret Angur did And sche to hem hir strengthe so kid. \u00b6 Thelamanyus Ayax was war That sche to grounde Gregais bar, In his herte hadde he gret Ire: He toke a spere & rode to hire And bar that ladi fro hur stede, Vn-warned or sche toke hede. But sche lepe vp as myghti quene, Hardi & bold, doghti & kene, Opon hir feet with-oute dwellyng, And swor that he schold that MS. bye that. fellyng In that day wel sore a-bye: Sche lete a stroke vpon him flye, \u00b6 Sche &yogh;aff him certis suche a pat That doun to grounde he fel flat; Sche toke hir hors & lepe vp tite\u2014 Maugre hir foos that stode be-syde\u2014 And rod hir thanne among the Grues And mechel bale amonges hem breues, Sche wroght hem wo In hir wode res, And many sche slees er sche hadde pes. PAntasalye hir stede by-strides, Among Gregais & Grues rides; Tydynges were that ladi tolde That sir Pirrus, that newe kny&yogh;t bolde, Hadde Philomene, that kyng, tan And swor that he MS. she. scholde be his ban. That bold mayden meved hir blod, When sche tho tydandes vndirstode; \u00b6 Sche vowes to god & alle his halowes: \"He scholde not lede him ouer the ffalowes To tent ne Pauyloun that he hadde.\" Alle hir Maydenes than sche badde To folwe hir where sche &yogh;ede, And leue hir not for no nede. \u00b6 With-oute mo wordes went sche forth, With alle hir maydenes that mechel were worth, To Pirrus & to his Murundones That with the help of her Gryffones Hadde taken that kyng Philomene. Harde strokes gan sche hem lene, \u00b6 The Murundones sche sondres & schedes, And fele of hem sche maymes & hedes; Many a baly scho ther rittes And many a scheld sche al to-sclittes MS. alto sclittes. ; Many a kny&yogh;t les his entrayles. So harde the quene hem assayles. UHen Pirrus saw that mescheff\u2014 Sche felde his men at gret repreue, How thei were hurt and euel dyght, Wounded euele and discomfyght With that quene Pantasalye,\u2014 Opon his men be-gan he crye And sayde: 'men, for him &yogh;ow boght! What do &yogh;e? ne schame &yogh;e noght To dye so foule of feble thinges? A few wommen to dethe &yogh;ow brynges? \u00b6 But turnes a&yogh;eyn & folowes me, And thei schal sone discomfit be! Ther schal but fewe\u2014so mote I thryue!\u2014 Off hem passe away on lyue!' He let thenne go kyng Philomene From him & hise qwite and clene With-oute ramsoun or any mede, For he myght him not thennes lede. PAntasalye herde his speche, On him sche thoght to take wreche: Sche drow toward him ner And seyde to him, that he myght her: 'Off thi proude wordes ne of thi sawe Ne of thi-selff I &yogh;eue not an hawe! By him that made al mydelerde! Off the am I not a-ferde, But now and euere I the dispise For thi fader cowardise, That he falsly sclow that knyght That passed al other In strengthe & myght, \u00b6 In doghtinesse & In valoure,\u2014 Off Chiualrie he was the floure,\u2014 The worthi kny&yogh;t Ector the gode! Alle the men of gentil blode Aught to venge his deth by skylle On the & alle that longeth the tille! And not only al gentil men, But we that are here wymmen Are comen to venge with oure myght The deth of that gentil knyght! \u00b6 For &yogh;it I hope that I & myne Schal venge his dethe on the & thine, For that fals traytour coward, thi sire! His soule mot brenne In helle fire!' At hir wordes Pirrus not smyled, When he herde him so reuyled: With-oute worde & mochel tene Rode sir Pirrus to the quene, To venge him if that he myght; And whan sche saw come that knyght, Sche slaked hir bridel & rayne And ran to him with al hir mayne, \u00b6 Hic Pirrus pugnauit cum Pantasalie Regina. And And , though the catch-word on lf. 248, bk. is Sche . kept that knyght In hir rennyng. In his grete tene and herte-brennyng \u00b6 Pirrus smot Pantasalye Opon the scheld so an hye, That al his spere In-sunder brast; But sche was not doun cast. But sche smot him wers than so, Sche brast hir spere on him In-two And bare him ouer the sadel y-wis, That he hadde leue the grounde to kys. But sicurli he ros vp sone, To venge that schame that sche had done Vn to him by-fore his folke, For tene his herte began to bolke: \u00b6 Stalworthe strokes sadde & sore Pirrus strok at hir thore, Thei made tho so gode pay That al her harneis was of blod ray; Al on blod was her harneis. But thenne come many proude Gregeis And partid hem sone a-twynne, And of her baret made hem blynne, And broght Pirrus a stede strong And horsed him hem among. PIrrus now & Pantasalie Bene partid with gret envie; Pan[ta]salye hir men relies, Philomene to hir he hyes And thanked hir of his lyueraunce, And prayes god: \"&yogh;eue hir gode chaunce; For sicurly nadde sche bene, His lyff hadde ben lorn clene.\" \u00b6 Agamenoun, her Emperour, Come then doun vnto that stour, With Alle his men Diomedes; So did the duk of Athenes, And alle thes other kynges euerychone With bowe, alblaster, and flone. \u00b6 The quene with hir men asamed, With the Gregeis was sche gramed, And the gode kyng Philomenys Relyed a&yogh;eyn to hir al his; And then come thedir a gode pas Kyng Remus, & Eueas, To socour hem with her meyne. Sicurly then myght men se A wonder stour a-&yogh;eyn be-gynne, To se who scholde the felde wynne. \u00b6 When ayther of hem were so refresched, Echon on other dong & thresched, That thei fel doun as water fro yse; Many a worthi man of prise Be-twene hem tho her liff thei tynte, Off that assaut er thei wolde stynte. Pirrus rode among the Troiens, He bete doun of her Citesens And sclow right fele,\u2014as Dares sais,\u2014 He halp wel that day Gregais. PIrrus rode to sir Glamicoun MS. . . . ou . . . son ; see note on p. 450. , A knyght that was Antenor sone MS. . . . ou . . . son ; see note on p. 450. , Palidomas was his half-brother, On lyue that tyme hadde he non other,\u2014 Off Another moder born; His lyff for-sothe has he lorn: For sir Pirrus In his wode layke, In his rydynge & In his rayke, With his sword smot he so sore, That he among hem died thore. \u00b6 Hic Pirrus occidit Glamiconem. \u00b6 Pantasalye by-fore hir eyne Saw Glamicoun die with pyne, Sche saw him die bothe blak & blo; For him sche was In herte wo, And for-fou&yogh;ten as sche was Sche come fro hir meygne a-pas And rod to him ouer-twert. And Pirrus it saw with Irus hert, And saw that quene to him ride As faste as sche my&yogh;t glide: He cau&yogh;te a spere\u2014I the be-hete\u2014 Strong & styff, that quene to mete; \u00b6 He stroke his stede & mette the quene, And so did sche him, & that was sene! Ayther other so assayled, That neyther of other fayled; Thei mette so that bothe &yogh;ede doun Fro her hors opoun MS. perhaps opon . her croun. \u00b6 But sone & smert bothe vp ros, And ayther of hem to hors gos, And lepe vp with mochel spede; And eyther of hem to other &yogh;ede, And fau&yogh;t to-gedur harde & longe, Til thei were partid with that thronge. Or elles longe or it hadde be nyght, That on hadde be foule discomfight. POlidomas when he herde say His brother had mad his endyng-day, Wo was him whan he hit wiste: Among the Gregais he him thruste, He sclow & faste leyde to grounde, He &yogh;aff the Gregais many a wounde, And sclow hem doun as he were wood; Thei lay & sprauled In her blood. And the quene Pantasalye\u2014 Thorow hir many doth dye: So thorow here bothe myght MS. myghtes. The Gregais were sone discomfight MS. discomfightes. And fledde away & lefft her place, And thei hem folwed a long pace. \u00b6 But Diomedes, and sir Pirrus, And the doghti Thelamenyus, These thre thanne hur chase with-stode And thei no further bacward &yogh;ode, But turned a&yogh;eyn & lefft here fyght, For it was ner-hond the nyght: The sonne was went In-to the west, Hit was ney set & gon to rest Scribblings in the margin, but blotted and therefore indistinct. ; And thei departed with weri bones And &yogh;ede alle hom to her wones,\u2014 \u00b6 Some to tentis & some to toun,\u2014 Did of her Armes & set hem doun, Ete & drank and &yogh;ede to bedde, Whan thei were alle wel y-fedde,\u2014 And ros a-&yogh;eyn when thei myght se, For thei wol not lete it so be, Vn-to that on were vndirlyng, And that other lord & MS. \u03b1. kyng. NIght is went with his merke cloude, The waites blew, the Cokkes croude, The sonne is rysen & schynes bryght, And thei are vppe & redi dyght Vnto her note a&yogh;eyn to go, Ther thei the nyght be-fore come fro.

Alle here dedis may I not telle, How thei fau&yogh;t to-geder euery day; Alle here dedis may I not say.

Day by day vpon the wold, That thei reste neuere\u2014as I &yogh;ow told\u2014 Til al that place & al that feld, Ther the fyght [was] be-twene hem held, Was spred ful of dede bodies As thei myght ligge y-wis.

THe trewes ar take & almost past, And sicurly these arn the last That euere schal Troyens or Grues take; For now schal thei an ende make; The next batayle schal be her ende; For than schal Troye to schame wende, And so schal alle the riche Troyens, For thei schal lese that hem mayntens. \u00b6 Schal neuere the kyng ne non of hise For al his noble & his vpprise A-&yogh;eyn Gregeis mayntene more stoure, For now lesen thei her mayntenoure And alle the gode that thei owe, And here houses brende on a lowe; And thei schal go to dethe vile, Euerychon with-Inne a while. \u00b6 But that schal be by fals tresoun; God &yogh;eue hem his malesoun That MS.

TErme is went out of the trewe, And that may men of Troye rewe: For if thei wiste what wolde be-tyde, Thei wolde not out of Troye ride. But now ben thei of Troye out-gon, Wel on horse is euerychone; \u00b6 In-to the feld are thei alle went, With scharp sword & bowe bent For to schete & smyte In haste; And thei of Grece ben comyng faste. Ful wel are thei now batayled, And echon other faste assayled With swordes & speres scharpe; Off alle her dedis may I not carpe. \u00b6 But Pirrus saw Pantasaly; Be-twene hem two was gret envy: He rode to hir, & sche to him, Ayther was on other brym; Pirrus smot that ladi so, That he to-barst his spere In-two And thrilled thorow-out hir scheld. But that quene hir sadel held That sche fel not with his smytyng, But sche smot him with-oute flytyng And &yogh;aff him on vn-to his mede, That hir spere In-sunder &yogh;ede; But he fel not ther-with to grounde, But sche &yogh;aff him an hidous wounde That of hir spere a gret parti Lefft stone-stille In his bodi. \u00b6 Hic Pirrus occidit Pantasaliam Reginam. PIrrus is smeten & euel dyght, His blod ran out with mochel myght; For him was made a gret cry Off alle the Grues that were him by; For thei were alle In mochel doute How the spere-hed scholde gon oute With-oute lesyng of his lyff. Then be-gan a delful stryff To hem of Troye ther thei stode: For alle the Grues were ney wode That sche smot him so greuously; Thei cried on hir dispitously, \u00b6 Thei vowed to god thei scholde hir sclo. Many a Grewe & Gregais tho &YOGH;ede aboute that dou&yogh;ti quene And did hir mochel wo & tene, Thei brak hir helm & hir hauberk And made al blod hir white scherk, Thei brast on-sonder many a mayle, The stalworthe lace of hir ventayle, Sicurly In-to her hare Thei maken hir hed naked & bare. \u00b6 When Pirrus saw hir hed al naked, In his body thoow he were staked With his spere-hede, to hir he soght As he of his lyff not roght; Off lyff ne deth &yogh;aff he no tale, But that he my&yogh;t brewe hir bale When he saw hir In suche a poynt: He smot hir euene In the Ioynt Be-twene the sholder & the scheld, That hir lefft arme fflow In the feld, And sche fel ded & stille lay Among hir horses as clot of MS.

PAntasalie is ded & sclayn, And thei of Grece are ther-of ffayn; But hir maydenes haue sorwe y-now, Many a Grewe that tyme thei sclow. Thei were so for the quene en-yred, To dye ther thei desired: Troyens thanne & tho wymmen Sclow two thousand doghti men. \u00b6 But what myght that a-vayle, Whil ther were &yogh;it with-oute fayle Thre hundrid thousand of Gregais knyghtes, Off bold men & stronge In fyghtes, And of sqwyers gret multitude?

THe waytes is set, the toun kept, That thei wele & sicurly slept. But thei of Grece haue hem be-cast With the sege wele & faste On euery a side ouer-al aboute, That thei may not for hem come oute. But ther-of haue thei no drede, But if thei haue of vitayles nede; \u00b6 For thei may leue & wele fare With-Inne the toun for euer-mare, But it be so that hem fayle Corn, or wyn, or other vytayle.

NOw is the taylage cast & layde, That somme was sone y-puruayde, The while it was In gaderyng. Antenor, that lyther thyng, Spake to the prest of the lawe That what with &yogh;efftis & with awe, What for drede, what for mede, That he the prest so ouer &yogh;ede, That he bad him at euen come, And he scholde haue Palladone. \u00b6 Antenor come thenne on a nyght, And that prest, that wicked wyght, &YOGH;aff him that relike that was so riche,\u2014 In al Assye was ther non liche; And he sende it to Vlixes, And to his felawe Diomedes. The Troyens gadered the gold & corn Erly at euen and on morn; Thei leyde that good & that fee In the temple of Menerue. \u00b6 Then seyde the riche Citesenes And alle these other pore Troyenes, That thei wolde make a sacrifice To her godis of gret aprice, To thanke hem of grace that thei sende That her batayle is thus at ende. THei broght tho many boles & bores, With lowyng & with loude rores; But ther be-tydde tho two miracles That were to hem gret obstacles: When be-fore the Auteres were layd the bestis,\u2014 As was that tyme that lawe hestis\u2014 That were doun come thedir, & renne To sette In fir, and do hit brenne, Thei did brynge the kiddis drye\u2014 For hit scholde brenne clere & hye,\u2014 And colis also In bollis & wyndel: Thei myght no fir make ther-on kyndel, For noght that thei coude blowe Not ones sette hit on a lowe. \u00b6 The Troyens were tho vn-blythe, Thei tende hire fir more than ten sithe, But it &yogh;ede out by on & on, That sacrifice myght thei make non. \u00b6 That other wonder, gode men, y-wis That hem be-fel that tyme, was this: Ther come fleynge that tyme an Erne Vn-to the temple, fleande sterne, And al the entrayle, as hit lay Off her bestis, bare he hit a-way; Be-twene here clauwes sche hem kyppis, And beres hem to the Gregais schippis. Alle the Troyens that ther wore, Off this two thinges abaist hem sore, For thei se by here tokenynges bothe That here godis with hem were wrothe; But whi it was, wiste thei neuere, But alle ther-of affrayed were. THe Gregais were slely by-thoght, A wonder werk hadde thei wroght: Thei did make an hors of bras, Suche a-nother neuere sene was; A thousand knyghtes myght ther-Inne; Ther-on was many a selcouthe gynne: Dores brode that opened wyde, A thousand men ther myght a-byde, But no man was of eye so bryght That myght with-oute of hem se sight. \u00b6 The kynges alle that comen wore To Priamus to socoure thore, When hit was done hem to vndirstonde That Priamus so foule a couenande Hadde mad to Grues to ben at one, Thei toke her leue at him echone, To wende hom to her contrese, And leffte him ther, & hem of Grece. \u00b6 Kyng Philomene had two thousand knyghtes That come with him, thei worthi wyghtes Ledde hem a&yogh;eyn to his lande But two hundrid & ffyffti of hem lyuande; He ledde with him Pantasalye, The worthi body of that ladye, \u00b6 Hic rogauit ad pacem & concordiam. And foure hundrid of damyseles That lyued afftir that turpeles, Vn-to the land of Amazone, To berye hir ther sche bar croune. HIt was a day, that lyther fende, Antenor, wolde his tresoun ende, Whan Palladin was y-stolne; And &yogh;it was hit fro Troyens holne; And thei of Grece her hors hadde ent. To sette a day was here entent, That Priamus & his Troyanes, Alle the Grues & the Danes, With-oute the toun, opoun the wolde, Be-twene hem that loueday schal holde. \u00b6 Priamus is comen oute, And mechel folk him aboute; And thei of Grece sicurly, Lordes & kynges ther redi. Thei did the relikes brynge, Her messe-bok that thei on synge, Here saynteuarius MS. sayntenarius. with al her gere, That bothe the parties on scholde swere. \u00b6 Diomedes was ffurst that swore, And made his othe vpon the flore; He swor by al here sayntwaries, And by him that al this world gyes, Off heuene & erthe al-myghti god: That he scholde neuere, for euene ne od, Breke the couenandes that he made With Antenor, so worth he glade. \u00b6 And so swor alle these other kynges That were of Grece gret lordynges. Off thai that toun afftir did for-lorn, &YOGH;it thei seyde thei were not for-sworn, For thei swore bothe to traye the toun With-oute mercy or any pardoun. But Priamus & alle hyes Made her othe on an-other wyes: \u00b6 Thei swor to holde the pees treuly, With-oute desert, parfitly; Thei were ther-with foule by-gyled And afftirward foule dispoyled, For thei wiste not of here fallas; Therfore here lyff thei lore, allas! WHan thei hadde sworn & mad surte, Kyng Priamus with herte fre Made men go afftir quene Helayne; And he &yogh;aff hem that lady a&yogh;eyne, And prayed hem for his loue sake: That sche of hem non harm scholde take, Vilony, ne no maugre, For that sche was In that contre; And thei seyde \"nay\" with ficul thoght. But Priamus thei hadde be-soght: \"That he wol graunte hem alle a bone, That for here loue it myght be done.\" \u00b6 Thei saide: \"thei hadde an hors done make For her godes Pallas sake, For that thei stale out of here chirche Palladine Or Palladium? MS. . . . in or . . . iu . , whan it was derke;\"\u2014 'And we are ferd alle for hir vengaunce; Hit is therfore oure ordinaunce, In hir cherche-&yogh;erd to do hit sette An hors of bras that we haue gette In hir honour\u2014we telle it &yogh;ow\u2014 For that is, sir, oure alther a-vow. \u00b6 We praye &yogh;ow therfore: werne vs not That it may now to hir be broght.' Priamus stode as he were dased, He was for meruayle al a-mased, When he herde the Gregays say That thei that relike hadde away; He hadde meruayle how hit myght be, Who hadde done him that blynde bounte? But sicurly the blame was layde On Vlixes, for it was seyde \"That he stale hit with Nigramancye, Fo[r] he was connynge of gret fayrye.\" PRyamus stode as stille as ston, Word to hem spake he non, He Answered not to here askyng, Better ne wors, ne non skynnes thyng. But Antenor & Eueas That bothe were ther In that plas, Thei seide: \"It was wel to do, Thei did the toun a worschepe tho, It was a presaunt fair & hende Vn-to the toun with-outen ende.\" \u00b6 Priamus graunt hem tho her wille, For he saw nede he moste ther-tille. The Gregeis thanne, bothe gret & smale And alle that dwelled In tent & hale, &YOGH;ede with gret processioun And with mochel deuoc[i]oun This brasen hors for to hale Ouer doune & ouer dale; Thei drow hit ouer leye & falowe, To offer hit to that carful halowe. \u00b6 When thei were comen to Troye &yogh;ate, Tho wolde it not In ther-ate: Hit was so brod, gret, and hye, It myght not In ther sicurly. Tho most thei the walles breke, Iff that hors scholde ther-In reke; Thei breke ther-of a gret pece Off brede, of heyghte, that thei of Grece That her hors thei myght In-drawe; The Troyens lowe, whan thei it sawe. \u00b6 Thei halpe hit In with mochel sang, Sicurly tho did thei wrang To make ther-fore Ioye & play, Hem oght better sey: \"waylaway! That euere it come with-Inne the diches!\" But euery a Troyen now it lykes, But hit schal turne to mochel care To alle the Troyens that ther ware. THe hors is now with-Inne the toun. Ther was a knyght that het Symoun That thei of Grece hadde put ther-In, A worthi kny&yogh;t of gentil kyn; A thousand knyghtes were put with him The order in MS. is 18139, 18138. And was charged on lyff and lym That thei scholde holde hem stille & coy, That thei perceyued not of Troy; Til hit be wele with-Inne the nyght, That thei of Troye to bedde be dyght. \u00b6 Thei bad thanne his dores vn-do And come than out, & his also, And of stre gete him a wase And make on the walles ther-of a blase, That thei myght wele & worldly kenne By that fir that so scholde brenne, Whan thei scholde come In that euenyng, And knowe also by that tokenyng, When thei of Troye were alle on slepe That thei &yogh;aff to hem no kepe, \u00b6 Hic Greci receperunt pecuniam. That thei myght sle hem In her bed, That thei no wise fro hem fled. \u00b6 The Gregeis asked thanne her fret, The somme of corn that hem was het, The somme of siluer & of gold That thei of hem haue schold; Priamus badde MS. hadde . tho his meygne That it scholde quyk delyuered be. The Gregais toke that riche tresore And drowe it alle with-oute dore Off the temple of Menerue, And by her men sende hom that fe Vn-to her tentis & Pauylons, To dele amonges the riche Gryffons; The corn bare thei vnto the see And charged ther-with alle her nauee. And when thei hadde al this ent, To Priamus thei message sent And seyde \"that thei wolde hamward wende Out of his lond vnto here frende\"; He bad hem \"go In godis name And god schilde hem fro schame!\" THei losed bothe Anker & cordes, \u00b6 Hic Greci vadunt ad Mare. And drow vp tentis of kynges & lordes, Thei gone to schippes & to bote That longe hadde stonden ther In flote; Thei drow here sayles that alle myght se That were In Troye, that riche Cite. Thei were wel fayn when thei saw go That hadde done hem so mochel wo, Thei wende thei hadde ben al quyt; But hem scholde falle gret wo &yogh;it, For thei schal dye In gret affray, Twenti thousand, er hit be day. \u00b6 Hic Greci exierunt de Caballo & occiderunt Troianos. \u00b6 Pryamus wendes to Ilioun, And Gregais sayles to Thenedoun; The wynd is swyfft, the schippis dryued, At Thenadoun were thei aryued; Er the sonne was go to reste, Thei hadde souped of the beste, With mochel murthe, play, & Ioye, For thei were siker tho of Troye.
