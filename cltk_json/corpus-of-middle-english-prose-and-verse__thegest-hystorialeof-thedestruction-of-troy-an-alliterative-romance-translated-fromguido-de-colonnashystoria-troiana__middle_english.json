Explicit Prologue.", "2": "Here begynnes the ffirst Boke. How Kyng Pelleus Exit Iason to get \u00fee ffles of golde. In Tessaile hit tyde as thus in tyme olde, A prouynce appropret aperte to Rome, An yle enabit nobli and wele With a maner of men, mermydons callid: There was a kyng in \u00feat coste \u00feat \u00fee kithe ought, A noble man for \u00fee nonest [is] namet Pelleus. That worthy hade a wyfe walit hym-seluon, The truthe for to telle, Tetyda she heght: \u00dees gret in \u00feere gamyn gate hom betwene, Achilles by chaunce chiualrous in armes. (More of thies Myrmydons mell I not now, Enabit in (\u00feat aile,) [ne] Etill will I ferre, MS. has \" \u00fetaile .\" How Mawros were men made on a day At \u00fee prayer of a prinse \u00feat peopull hade loste.) This Pelleus pert, prudest in armys, Hade a bro\u00feer of birthe born or hym-seluyn, That heire was & Eldist, and Eson he hight. Till it fell hym by fortune, faintyng of elde, Unstithe for to stire, or stightill the Realme, And all were, & weike, wantide his sight, Of Septur and soile he sesit his brothir, And hym crownede as kyng in \u00feat kithe riche. Eson afterwarde erdand on lyffe, Endured his dayes drowpynge in age, As Ovide openly in Eroydos tellus, How Medea the maiden made hym all new, By crafte \u00feat she kouth of hir coint artys. Eson, \u00feat elde man \u00feat I er saide, Hade a son of hym-selfe semly to wale, And Jason, \u00feat gentill aioynet was to name: A faire man of feturs, & fellist in armys, As meke as a Mayden, & mery of his wordis. This Jason for his gentris was ioyfull till all, Wele louit with \u00fee lordes & the londe hole; All worshipped \u00feat worthy inwones aboute, No les \u00fean \u00fee lege \u00feat hom lede shuld: And he as bainly obeyede to the buerne his Eme, As \u00feof his syre hade the soile & septure to yeme. Pelleus persayuit the people anone, That the londe so hym louede, lorde as he were, And ay drede hym on dayes for doute \u00feat might falle, Lest he put hym from priuelage & his place toke, Of Tessaile, as truthe wolde, to be trew kyng. Thus Pelleus with payne was pricket in hert, ffull egurly with enuy, & euer hym bethoght, With a course of vnkyndnes he caste in his thoghte, The freike vpon faire wise ferke out of lyue, And he no daunger nor deire for \u00feat dede haue. He bethought hym full thicke in his throo hert, And in his wit was he war of a wyle sone, Of a fame \u00feat fer in fele kynges londes, And borne was a brode for a bare aunter. Out in the Orient Orible to here, In a cuntre was cald Colchos by name, Was (an) aunter in a nyle \u00feat I nem shall, MS. has \" as .\" Beyonde the terage of Troy as \u00fee trety sayse, There was a wonderfull wethur weghes to be-holde, With a flese \u00feat was fyne, flamande of gold; And \u00fee Kyng of \u00feat coste callid was by name Chethes, for sothe, as souerayne & lord: He was mighty on molde & mekull goode hade, His pride well ouerput, past into elde. This whethur and \u00fee wole were wonderly keppit By the crafte & the cure & conyng of Mars, That with charmes & enchauntementes was chefe gode. Thus coyntly it kept was all with clene art, By too oxen oribull on for to loke, And a derfe dragon drede to be-holde. These balfull bestes were, as \u00fee boke tellus, ffull flaumond of fyre with fnastyng of logh, That girde thurgh ther gorge with a grete hete A nelne brode all Aboute, \u00feat no buerne might ffor the birre it abide, but he brente were. And wo this wethur shuld wyn bude wirke as I say, Ayre euyn to \u00fee Oxen, entre hom in yoke, With striffe or with stroke till \u00feai stonde wolde; Aftur ayre vp the erthe on ardagh wise. Sythen drawe to \u00fee dragon, & \u00fee derfe qwelle, Girde out the grete teth of the grym best, And alse sede in \u00fee season sowe it on \u00fee erthe, Than a ferlyfull frute shall he fynde after: The tethe shall turne tite vnto knightes Armyt at all peses, able to were Thai to falle vpon fight as fomen belyue, With depe woundes and derfe till all be dede euyn. All thes perels to passe with-outen payne other, That the flese wold fecche & ferke yt away. Of this wonderfull wethur for to here more, Why it kept was by craft on so coynt wyse; Hit was said oft sythes and for sothe holden, That Chethes the same king had a som hoge Of grete gobbettes of gold in the ground hide, And so kepid it with craft of his coynt artys: And for to get of this gold & the grete sommys, ffor couetous \u00feere come knightes full ofte, And endit in Auerys to ay lastand sorowe. This Pelleus with pyne printede in hert Iff he might sleghly be sleght & sletyng of wordes, Gar Jason with any gyn the journey vndertake: He were seker as hym semyde for sight of hym euer, And most likly be loste & his los keppit. He purpast hym plainly in his pure wit ffor to tyse hym \u00feerto, if it tyde might, To take it hertely on honde in a high pride, And \u00fee way for to wylne with wilfull desyre. He cast hym full cointly be cause of this thyng. In a Cit\u00e9 be-syde to somyn a fest, With princes and prelates & prise of the lond, Thre dayes to endure with daintes ynogh. The iij d day throly he thought in his hert ffor to mele of this mater, \u00feat he in mynde hade: He cald Jason in his Japis with a Joly wille. Before the baronage at ther burde thus \u00fee buerne saide,\u2014 \"Cosyn, it is knowen \u00feat I am Kyng here, And mekyll comfordes me the crowne of this kyde realme; But more it Joyes me, Jason, of \u00fei just werkes, \u00deat so mighty & meke & manly art holdyn: Now \u00fei fame shall goo fer & \u00feu furse holdyn, And all prouyns & pertes \u00fei pes shall desyre. To tessayle a tresure tristy for euer, Thy selfe to be sene and in suche fame, By \u00fei name \u00feus anoisyt & for noble holden, Whyle \u00feou rixlis in this Reame no riot we drede, But all fferd be \u00feerfore and frendship dyssire. Hit wold sothely me set as souerayne in Joye, Iff our goddes wold graunt \u00feat \u00feu grace hade, That the fflese \u00feat is ffreshe flamond of gold Were brought throw \u00fei boldness into \u00feis byg yle And \u00feat wold doutles be done & no dere In, Wold \u00feu afforce \u00fee \u00feerfore and \u00fee fight take, Be of gouernance graithe & of good wille. Yiff \u00feu puttes \u00fee pristly \u00feis point for to do, Thou shall arayit be full ryolle with a route noble Of my Baronage bolde & my best wise. I shall spare for no spence & \u00feu spede wele, And do \u00fei deuer duly as a duke nobill: Thou shalt haue holly my hert & my helpe alse, And be lappid in my luffe all my lyffe after. \u00deu may be glad for to get such a good name, And haue for \u00fei hardynes a full hegh mede: Leve \u00feis for lell, me list it perfourme, And to hold it with hert \u00feat I hete nowe, I will fayne \u00fee [no] faintis vnder faith wordes. When my dayes be done \u00feu shalt be Duke here, And haue \u00fee Crowne to kepe of \u00feis Kyd Realme; And while I liffe in this londe, no less \u00fean my selfe, Halfe for to haue & hold for \u00fei name, And with all weghis to be worshipt to \u00fee worldes ende.\" WHEN PELLEUS his proses hade puplishit on highe, And all soburly said with a sad wille, Jason was Joly of his Juste wordes, \u00deat in presens of the pepull \u00feo profers were made, And mony stythe of astate stonding aboute. He hedit not the harme \u00feat in his hert lurkyt, Ne the ffalshed he faynit vnder faire wordes; He drede no dissayet of his dere vncle, But hooped full hertely it come of hegh loue. \u00deen he trist hym full tyte in his tried strenght, Thurghe hardynes of hond hopit to spede; He put noght vnpossible pelleus wordes, Ne the kynges couetous cast not before: \u00deen he grauntis to go with a grete chere, And all thies fferlyes to fraist he fursly awouet. PELLEUS Pelleus of the proffer was proude at his hert, And glad of \u00fee graunt before the grete lordys; He ertid to an end egurly fast, \u00deat no tarying shuld tyde ouer a tyme set; And \u00feet ffortune vnderfonges \u00feat he feile shall, And will put hym fro purpos \u00feat he presys after. He consydret \u00feat Calcos was closet in an yle, \u00deat no creature might keuer for course of the see, But with ship \u00feat shapon were for \u00fee shyre waghes. \u00dean he comaundet to come of \u00fee crafte noble, A wright \u00feat was wise \u00feis werke for to ende; And Argus \u00feat after was abill of his crafte, Sone he dressit to his dede & no dyn made, And made vp a mekyll ship, \u00fee most vpon erthe, \u00deat after hym awne selfe Argon was cald. Sum sayn full sure & for sothe holdyn, Hit was \u00fee formast on flete \u00feat on flode past, \u00deat euer saile was on set vpon salt water, Or euer kairet ouer cost to cuntris O fer. Now ordant was althing onestly \u00feere, And abundantly broght \u00feat hom bild might, With all stuff for \u00fee stremes, \u00feat hom strenght shuld. Mony noble for \u00fee nonest to \u00fee note yode, Tryed men \u00feat were taken of tessayle rewme, To this Journey with Jason, as the gest tellus: All entred into Argon after anon. OFF ERCULES. There was honerable Ercules egur of wille, As poyetes haue pricked of his prise fader: He was getton of a god on a gret lady, \u00deat ajoinet was Iobeter to his iuste nome, And his moder full mylde Almena was clepid: She was wyffe as I wene to worthy Amphitrio. This Ercules euermore egur & nobill, The worde of his werkes thurghe \u00fee worlde sprange: So mony groundes he for-justede & of ioy broght, That no tung might hom telle \u00feof it tyme hade. Hit is tolde in his tyme, wo \u00feat trawe lyst, In his hastines he highyt vnto helle yates, A \u00fere hedet hounde in his honnd coght, That was keper of the close of \u00feat curset In: So dang he \u00feat dog with dynt of his wappon, \u00deat \u00fee warlag was wete of his wan atter, And thurgh voidyng of venym with vomettes grete, Mony prouyns and perties were put out of helle. All \u00feat poites haue pricket of his prise dedis, I haue no tome for to telle ne tary no lengur. But \u00fee wonders \u00feat he wroght in \u00feis world here, In yche cuntr\u00e9 ben knowen vnder Criste euyn. Tow pyllers he pight in a place lowe, Vppon Gades groundes, \u00feat he gotton hade: Too whiche pyllers priste as prouyt is before, The mighty Massidon Kyng maister of All, The Emperour Alexaunder Aunterid to come: He wan all the world & at his wille aght. A hiatus occurs here in the MS. of perhaps two or three pages. The extent of the obvious gap at the beginning of Book II. was not suspected, till it was ascertained that the work was a translation from Guido de Colonna. The following extracts, from the Stras|burg edition, 1489, continue the story. Obtenta ergo a rege Peleo Iason nauigandi licentia nova sulcat maria cum Hercule et suis complicibus navi nova cujus vela dum secundus ventus imbuit et ejus inflat afflatus loca Thesalie cognita deserit valde cito et ad incognita maris loca citius dissilit velocissimo cursu suo. Multis itaque diebus ac noctibus navigantibus illis sub ducto Thesalici Philotete eis discrete notantibus stellarum cursum visibilium existentium juxta polum majoris urse scilicet et minoris que nunquam occidunt. Noverat enim Philotetes stellarum cursus et motum si aliquis est in illis tanquam ille qui causa navigationis erat multum expertus. et imo aura secunda perflante tamdiu recto remige navigavit donec ad oras phrigias regni Trojani videlicet pertinentias nova navis applicuit in portum scilicet qui tunc dicebatur ab incolis Simoenta.", "3": "Liber Secundus. De Grecis applicantibus in pertinencias Troj\u00e6, et de Laomedonta rege licentiante Iasonem et Herculem de locis illis. Greci autem maris fatigatione lassati ut pervenerunt in terram in ipsam descendere quietis causa sitienti animo moliuntur et descendentes ibidem recentes aquas a fontibus hauriunt et ibidem pro majoris refrigerationis gratia moram per dies aliquos statuerunt non ut incolis molestiam inferre disponerent nec nociuis dispendiis eos ledere aliquatenus at|temptarent. Sed invida fatorum series qu\u00e6 semper quiete viventibus est molesta ab inopinatis insidiis sine causa inimi|citiarum et scandali causas traxit propter quas tante cladis diffusa lues orbem terrarum infecerit ut tot reges et principes bellicosa nece succumberent et tanta et talis civitas qualis extitit magna Troja versa fuisset in cinerem tot viduatis muli|eribus viris suis orbatis parentibus et tot pueris et tot puellis et demum jugo servitutis addictis. Subsequenter describit historia quod Iasone et Hercule cum suis in portu quiescentibus Simoente de eis ad Laomedontam regem Trojanum fama pervenit, quod gens qu\u00e6dam Trojanis incognita scilicet gens gr\u00e6corum novo remigi Frigias partes intravit exploratura forte archana regni Trojani vel potius Troj\u00e6 provinciam vastatura. Erat autem diebus illis Troja \n  non tant\u00e6 magnitudinis qualis fuit postmodum de novo firmata, et in ea regnabit tunc rex predictus Laomedon nomine qui sumpto damnoso consilio quod utinam non fuisset legatum suum in comitia multorum ad Iasonem destinavit; quo ad Iasonem veniente legationem suum explicat in h\u00e6c verba. Rex Laomedon hujus regni dominus de adventu vestro valde miratur quare terram suam intravistis ab eo licentia non obtenta cujus est intentio sub tranquilla pace eam tenere; hoc instantissime mandat vobis ut incontinente debeatis terram ejus exire ita quod adveniente die sequenti sciat vos ab omnibus terr\u00e6 su\u00e6 finibus recessisse; quod si mandatorum suorum sentiet vos con|temptores pro certo noveritis ipsum jubere suis in offensionem vestram irruere et depopulationem rerum et vestrarum finale dispendium personarum. Postquam Iason totam seriem lega|tionis audivit totus in ira et dolore cordis exacerbatus intrin|secus antequam ad legationis dicta verba mutuata retorqueret, conversus ad suos sic locutus est eis. Laomedon rex hujus regni dominus mirabilis dedecoris injuriam nobis infert cum absque alicujus offensionis causa nos ejici a sua terra man|davit. Itaque si eum regia nobilitas animasset nos mandare debuisset honorari. Nam si casus similis illum in Gr\u00e6ciam adduxisset scivisset sibi illatum a Gr\u00e6cis non dedecus sed ho|norem. Sed ex quo magis sibi dedecus quam honor applausit, nos etiam applaudimus ut illi et ab ejus regni finibus recedamus cum posset contingere et leve sit quod ejus enorm\u00e6 consilium sit carissimo pretio redempturus. Deinde continuatis verbis conversus ad nuntium dixit, Amice! legationis tu\u00e6 verba diligenter audivimus et dona qu\u00e6 per regem tuum nobis more nobilium sunt transmissa recepimus sicut decet, deos nostros in dei veritate testamur non ex proposito terram tui regis intrasse ut offensam ingereremus in aliquem more predonio violentiam illaturi. Sed cum ad remotiores partes conferre nos nuperrime intendamus necessitas in hunc locum divertere necessario nos coegit. Dic ergo regi tuo nos de sua terra sine mora postposita recessuros scituro pro certo quod etsi non per nos poterit forte per alios qui presentem injuriam nobis illatam audierint non lucra sed pressuras et dampna infallibiliter obtinere. Hercules vero verbis Iasonis non contentus regis nuncio refudit h\u00e6c verba. Amice quisquis es secure referas regi tuo quod ad plus die crastina de terr\u00e6 su\u00e6 statione penitus discedemus, sed sequentis tertii anni dies non erit exitura dic illi quam nos videbit si vivet in terram suam velit nolit anchoras injecisse et de danda nobis tunc recedendi licentia non erit sibi plena libertas cum talis litis ad presens inchoaverit questionem quod priusquam de eo possit superare victoriam ignominiosi dede|coris pondere depremetur. Cujus regis nuncius respondendo sic dixit. Turpe satis est et nobili et precipue strenuo minarum sagittas immittere nec mihi qui sum missus, est commissum a rege ut erga vos litigiosis verbis insistam. Dixi vobis qu\u00e6 mihi commissa fuerunt, si sapienter agere placet vobis do con|silium bonum ut ab hac terra recedere non sit grave priusquam possitis incurrere graviora, cum leve non sit personas perdere qu\u00e6 se possunt consilio salubri tueri. Et post h\u00e6c a Gr\u00e6cis petita licentia suum remeavit ad regem. Iason vero et Hercules nulla mora protracta Philotete vocato jubet anchoram a mari subtrahi et omnia colligere qu\u00e6 in terram adduxerant causa quietis. Sciebant enim si voluissent in Phrigios insultare non esse eis in congressu pares vel equales in viribus nec in potentia fortiores. Ergo Argon ascendunt et elevatis velis diis ducibus Frigia deserunt littora et sulcantes maria ventis afflantibus prosperis non post multos dies in Colcos insulam salvi perveniunt et desideratum feliciter portum intrant. In insula igitur Colcos erat tunc temporis qu\u00e6dam civitas nomine Iaconites caput regni pro sua magnitudine con|stituta.

The Kyng of his curtessy Kayres hom vnto, Silet furthe of his Citie seriaunttes hym with, Mony stalworth in stoure as his astate wold; Than he fongid \u00feo freikes with a fine chere, With hailsyng of hed bare, haspyng in armys, And led hom furthe lyuely into a large halle, Gaid vp by a grese all of gray marbill, Into a chamber full choise (chefe) on \u00feere way, MS. has \" chese .\" \u00deat proudly was painted with pure gold ouer, And \u00fean sylen to sitte vppon silke wedis, Hadyn wyn for to wale & wordes ynow.

The Kyng was full curtais, calt on a maiden, Bede his doughter come downe & his dere heire, To sit by \u00feat semely, and solas to make. This maiden full mylde, Medea was callid, Whan she sought into sale salute hom all, With loutyng full low to hir lefe fadir. She was eldist & heire etlit to his londes, Hym chefet thurghe chaunse childer no mo; And she at hond for to haue husband for age, Byg ynoghe vnto bed with a bold knight. She was luffly of lere & of lore wise, And kyndly hade conyng in the clene artis: \u00deere was no filisofers so fyn found in \u00feat lond, Might approche to \u00feat precious apoint of her wit. THE CRAFTE OF MEDEA. Of nygramansi ynogh to note when she liket, And all the fetes full faire in a few yeres. Wyndis at hir wille to wakyn in the aire, Gret showres to shede & shynyng agayne, Haile from the heuyn in a hond while, And the light make les as hir lefe thought; Merke at the mydday & the mone chaunge, To clere Sune into Clippis & the cloudes dym; The Elementes ouerturne & the erthe qwake, fflodes with forse flow agayne the hilles; Bowes for to beire in the bare winttur, ffor to florisshe faire & \u00fee frute bryng; Yong men yepely yarke into Elde, And the course agayne calle into clere youthe.

As he formed hom first flitton \u00feai neuer; Ne the clere Sune neuer clippit out of course yet, But whan Criste on the crosse for our care deghit; Than it lost hade the light as our lord wold, Erthe dymmed by dene, ded men Roose, The gret tempull top terned to ground. This Medea the maiden, \u00feat I mynt first, \u00deat gay was in garmentes & of good chere, And als wemen haue wille in \u00feere wilde youthe, To fret hom with fyn perle, & \u00feaire face paint, With pelur and pall & mony proude rynges, Euyn set to \u00fee sight and to seme faire: This gentill by Jason ioinet was to sit, As be comaundement in courtte of hir kynd fader.

When this mylde in hir maner was at \u00fee meite set Betwene hir fader and \u00fee freke, \u00feat I first ment, Hir shire fface all for shame shot into rede, And a likyng of loue light in her hert; Hir Ene as a trendull turned full rounde, ffirst on hir fader, for feare \u00feat she hade, And sethyn on \u00feat semely with a sad wille; Smale likyng of loue lurkit in hir mynde, And she light on \u00feat lede with a loue egh; ffirst on his face fresshe to beholde, And his lookes full louely lemond as gold, And all ffeturs to ffynd fourmed o right. The sight of \u00feat semely sanke in hir herte, And rauysshed hir radly \u00fee rest of hir sawle, Sho hade no deintithe to dele with no deire meite, And hir talent was taken for tastyng of wyne.

Thus sho drof forth hir dayes in hir depe thoght, With weping and wo all the woke ouer, Till it fell hir by fortune, as I fynd here, On a day, as the Dukes were ouer des set, And comynd with the Kyng of Knighthode in Armys, Chethes for \u00feat semly sent into chamber, Bade his doughter come doune to hir dere fader: And sho obeit his bone, & of boure come In clothes as be-come for a kynges doughter, And obeit the bolde, and bowet hir fader; And he assignet hir a seite, \u00feat hir-selfe liket, With chere for cherys the chiualrus Knightes, As maner was of Maidones, with hir myld chere. His comaundment to kepe sho hir course held, And Joynet by Jason iustly to sit; And he welcomed \u00feat worthy as he well kouthe: A litill set hym on syde, & a seet leuet, ffor to mele with \u00feat maidyn & hir mode here. The Kyng with other knightes hade comford to speike Ercules of armes, & auntres to telle Of chiualry & chaunce, \u00feat cheuyt hym before, \u00deat no lede was lelly \u00feo louers betwene, But \u00feai might say by hom-self all \u00feere sad wille.

Achates it calde is with clene men of wit, And in Cicill forsothe sene was it first: Eneas it name & in note hade, Whan he to cartage come vnknowen with sight. And \u00fean ho broght hym a bref all of brode letres, \u00deat was comly by crafte a clerke for to rede; And enformyt him fayre how he fare shuld, When he [h]is deuer hade done & drow to \u00fee whethir, ffor to knele on his knes to the cold erth, And grete all his goddes with a good chere; And the rolle for to rede or he rest thry, As with Sacrifice to shew & seruice to goddes, \u00deat hym grauntede of grace \u00feat gifte for to haue, \u00deat he might worthely it welde, & away beire. And \u00fean sho gafe hym a glasse with a good lycour, And bade whan he buskyt to the bolde Exin, To werke it with mesure, & in hor mouthe caste, And \u00feai clappe shall full clene, & neuer vnclose aftur, Ne neuer dere hym a dyse with no dede efte. Thus enfourmet ho \u00feat fre of \u00fee fete euyn, How he wyn shuld his worship, & his woche pas: And \u00feen lacches his leue & his loue kyst, Past furth priuely and \u00feat pert leuyt, Enon lurkys to his loge, & laide hym to slepe. By the renke hade hym restid ryses the sun, Brightis all the burghe and the brode valis; Meuyt ouer the mounteyns men to beholde. Jason feynit with fare as he hade fast sleppit, And now rapis hym to ryse & rom from his bede. With Ercules and o\u00feer mo of his aune men, He sues furth on \u00fee soile to Chethes the kyng, In company of kynges and o\u00feer clene burnes. Whan he was ware of \u00fee wegh, welcomed hym faire, And spird at hym specially what his spede were. Than Jason vnioynid to the gentill speche:\u2014 \"Lord, and it like you, longe am I here! Wold ye graunt me your grase goodly to wende, I wold boune me to batell, and take my bare aunter, Yon worthy wethir to wyn, & your wille be.\" THE COUNSELL OF CHETES TO JASON. The Kyng \u00fean full curtesly karpes agayne: Sais, \"Jason, this Jorney is no ioye in, I am ferd, by my faith, of \u00fei frele yowth, \u00feat hit lede \u00fee to losse and \u00fei lyffe tyne, And me harme for to haue of thy hegh wille, To be sclaundret of \u00fei skathe, & \u00feou skape noght. \u00deerfore ffrynd, by my faith, vppon faire wise, I counsell \u00fee in kyrt, kaire to \u00fei londe, And put of \u00feis purpos, for perille \u00feat may folowe.\" Jason carpes to the kyng, conyngly he said, \"Sir I hade counsaill in \u00feis case er I come here, And ye shall boldly be blameles, \u00feof me bale happyn, \u00deat I wilne of my wit & wilfull desyre.\" \u00dean the kyng to \u00fee knight carpes these wordes;\u2014 \"ffrynd \u00feou shall fully haue fauer to wend, And ouer goddes \u00fee graunt grace of \u00fei hele.\" He lowted the lege kyng, & his leue toke, Dressit hym for his dede, dose hym to goo. In an yle \u00feat was negh \u00fee noble kynges sete, This clene flese was inclosede all with clere water, Euon a forlong \u00feerfro, & fully nomore. Jason to \u00feis Jorney ioynes hym belyffe, Bowes euyn to \u00fee banke & a bote fonde, Entris with armur & all his other gere, ffore to \u00fee fer syde, noght aferd was: Gird vp to \u00fee grounde, gripes his weppon, Armur & all thing atlet before, \u00deat Medea \u00fee maiden myldly hym betaght, And past furth prudly his pray for to wyn. Mournyng the maiden made in hir thought, Lest \u00fee ffyre shuld hym fere of \u00fee fuerse bestes, \u00deat was blasound of brunston with a brem lowe. Sho went vp wightly by a walle syde To the toppe of a toure, & tot ouer the water ffor to loke on hir luffe, longyng in hert. So ferd was \u00feat fre, & he faile shuld, Sho brast out bright water at hir brode een. Thus sykyng ho said with a sade wille:\u2014 \"A! Jason my ioye & my gentill knight, I am ferd lest \u00feou faile of my fyn lore, And for &yogh;enernes for-&yogh;ete \u00feat \u00fee &yogh;eme shuld; Thou dawly bes dede, & I to doll broght, Neuer \u00fee comly to kysse, ne clippe in myn armys. Now full pristly I pray to my prise goddes, \u00deat I may see thee come sounde to \u00feis sale enys, And me comford of thy coursse, kepe I no more.\" When the knight was comyn into \u00fee cliffe ferre, He waites vmbe hym wightly, & was ware sone Of \u00fee orible oxin, vgsome to see, \u00deat fyre out fnast with a fuerse lowe, \u00deat no buerne might abide but he brent were; Hit gird from the grym with so gret hete. HOW JASON WAN THE FFLESE OF GOLDE. The tokyn hym taght was of a tru maiden He for&yogh;et not, but &yogh;epely &yogh;arkit hym \u00feerfore, And anoyntide hym anon with his noble boyste, Bothe the face and \u00fee fete, & all \u00fee fore perte. His noble ymage at his necke for neghyng of fyre, And his rolle \u00fean he rede as he to reste toke; ffore evyn to \u00fee fight with \u00feo felle bestes. So \u00fee fuerse by-flamede all with fyre hote, \u00deai brent vp his brode shilde & his bigge speire; And Jason for all \u00feo Japes hade nere his ioy lost, Hade his licour ben to laite, \u00feat \u00fee lede caght, And caste it be course into the core hete: Hit stake vp the stith lippes as stiffe bounden, As \u00feai chaltrede were choisly with chenys of yerne, \u00deat abatede the breme hete, brent it no more. All cold it became & the course helde, Bothe of ymur & aire, after I-wise. ffayne was the freike & fore to \u00fee hornes Of \u00fee balefull bestes, & hom aboute ladde; \u00deai were made als meke as maistur behouet, And as bowande to \u00fee bowes as any bestes might. &YOGH;ynerly the &yogh;epe knight &yogh;okit hom belyue, Pight hom into ploghe, pilde vp the vrthe, Braid vp bygly all a brode ffeld: And all the gayre of the ground \u00feere \u00fee gome leuyt. Drow euyn to the dragon, dressit hym to fight, And he gird him agayne with a grym noyse: Mony slecynges vnslogh throughe hys slote yode. As \u00fee welkyn shold walt, a wonderfull noyse Skremyt vp to the skrow with a skryke ffelle. With a smorther & a smoke smult through his nase, He rut out roidly with a rede hete, \u00deat all blasit the bent on a breme lowe; And as he tilt out his tung with his tethe grym, He straght fro hym stremes all of styth venym. The freike was a-ferd of \u00feat felle beste, And raght to his Ryng in a rad haste, Held it high in his hond, \u00feat he behold might. ffor chynyng of the chene stone he shont with his hede, And with-droghe the deire of his dere attur; All dropet the dule as he degh wold. \u00deis stone full of strenght, as \u00fee story tellus, Is erdand in Jud\u00e9, as Isoder sais: Be it smethe ow\u00feer smert, smaragden hit hat. \u00deere is no derffe dragon, ne no du edder, Ne no beste so bold with no bale atter, May loke on \u00fee light, but he his lyffe tyne. \u00deis stone with his stremys stroyed all the venym, And drepit the dragon to the dethe negh. Jason grippede graithly to a grym sworde, Dange on the deuyll with a derffe wille, Tyll the stremys of stynke & of stythe venum Past out in the place pyne to be-holde. He laid on \u00feat loodly, lettyd he noght, With dynttes full dregh, till he to dethe paste, And he Enfecte the ffirmament with his felle noise. Jason of his iorney was ioyfull ynoghe, Gryppet a grym toole, gyrd of his hede, Vnioynis the Jamnys \u00feat iuste were to-gedur: Gyrd out the grete tethe, grippet hom sone, Sew hom in the soile or he sesse wold. Stythe knightes and stoure stert vp agayne, Armet at all peses abill to fight, Delt dynttes full derffe, geuyn depe woundes. These balefull brether batell so longe, Till none left was alyue ne o lofte stode. Now thies charmys & enchauntementtes are cheuit to noght, Dede ys the dragon and the derffe knightes, The exin left on \u00fee lond vnneth lyfe in, He past all his perels and no pyne tholed. By the crafte so coynt \u00feat hym kend were, He glydis forthe gladly to the golde fflese, Wynnes to the wethir, wroght hym to dethe, fflypit of the fflese ffoldet it somyn; Thonkes gretly his goddis \u00feat hym grace lent The flese for to fonge and no fay worthe. Jason was ioly, hade Juels ynogh, Busket to the bank and the bote tok, Stird ouer the streame streght to \u00fee lond, \u00deere he found all his feris fayne of his werke; Ercules and o\u00feer \u00feat euer were abyding, \u00deat fayne were to fonge \u00feat freike vppon lyue. Jason with ioy and his ioly ffellowes Soghten euen to the Sete of Chetes \u00fee kyng. And he as wee full of worship welcomed hom all With a faynyng fare vnder faire chere; Hade no deynt\u00e9 of the dede but dere at his hert, Ne of ryches so Riall \u00feat the Renke hade: He assignet hym a sete by hym-selfe euyen. The flammyng of \u00fee flese was ferly to see, &yogh;et merueld hym more how Mars was distroyed, Geter of his good and a god holdyn. Medea the mayden with a mylde chere, Was Joyfull of Jason, Aioynit hym to, Kyst hym full curtesly, and of his come fayne. By \u00feat semly he sate as hir syre bade, Ho prayet hym priuely all with pert wordes, To bow to hir bede boldly at euyn; And he hir graunted \u00feat gate with a good wille. When it turnyt to \u00fee tyme as I told ere, He bowes to hir bed \u00feere he ben hade, And lay \u00feere in lustes \u00fee long night ouer, In Solas on soche wise as hom-selfe thoght, And spekyn of hor spede while \u00feai space hade, ffor to fare on \u00fee fome into fer londes; But Medea mouet hym a moneth to lenge. \u00deen leuyt \u00feai the lond and no leue toke, Stale from \u00fee styth kyng styll\u00e9 by night; With \u00fee maiden Medea & myche o\u00feer goodes, \u00deai turne into Tessaile with-outen tale more, Hit vp into a havyn all the hepe samyn. Pelleus not prowde hade pyne at his hert, \u00deat Jason of his Jorney Joifully hade sped, And faynet ay faire wordes vnder felle thoghtes, Holy het hom to have \u00fee hestes before. Jason of his Jorney was ioyfull ynoghe, \u00deat he hade fongit \u00fee flese & \u00fee fresshe gold; He hedit not the hestes ne the hegh othes, Ne he keppid no couenaund to \u00fee kynd maydon. But a Sourdyng with sourgrem sanke in his hert, And a lourekand lust to Lamydon the kyng: Ercules with Enuy was enmy also. \u00deai comynd in the case, cast hom \u00feerfore, Comyn euyn to the kyng & \u00fee cause tolde Of dyshoner he did and his derfe wordes, \u00deat the grettyst of Grise gremyt \u00feerat; And heghly to helpe heghtyn \u00feai all, As I shall telle you the treuthe truly hereaftur.", "5": "Here begynneth \u00fee ffourth boke.

Castor the king conceyuit beliue, That Nestor with noy was nolpit to ground, He Richet his Reynes and his roile stroke, Suet vnto Sedar with a sore wepyn, To deyre hym with a dynt for \u00fee Dukes sake. And er he come to the king, so his course fell, One caupet with hym kenely, a cosyn of Sedars, And set hym a sad dynt, Secorda he high[t]: His shafte all-to sheuerit the shalke was unhurt, And Castor in the caupyng the knight euyll wondyt, A Sore dynt in the syde at the same coursse. Sedar was sory for sake of his cosyn, Carue euyn at Castor with a kene sworde, \u00dee shilde away share vnto the shyre necke, And all \u00fee haspes of his helme \u00feat \u00fee hede &yogh;emyt; With a swinge of his sworde swappit hym in \u00fee fase, Bare hym ouer backeward to \u00fee bare vrthe.

The kynges son of Cartage & a knight noble, Aliet vnto Lamydon by his lefe suster, Cosyn to the kyng, & he his kyde Em, Pit\u00e9 of \u00feat pert knight persit his hert, \u00deat the shire water shot ouer his shene chekys. Myche woo hade \u00fee wegh for \u00fee wale knight, And assemblit his sad men on a soppe hole, With a horne \u00feat he hade, in a hond while, (Seuyn thousand be sowme all of sure knightes,) And charget hom chefely for chaunse vppon vrthe, ffor to dere for the dethe of his dere cosyn. \u00deen the Troiens full tite tariet no lengur, Gird euyn to the Grekes with a grym fare; Slogh hom downe sleghly & slaunge hom to grounde; Wondit of \u00fee wightist, warpide hom vnder; Put hom fuersly to flight, folowet hom after To the banke of the brode see \u00feere botis were leuit. \u00feere Lamydon \u00feem leuyt, for a lede come With tithynges fro the towne told to the kyng; One Dotes, with dyntes \u00feat dedly was wondyt, Said the Citie was sesit & sad men \u00feere-in, Of our fos full fell, fuerse men in Armys, A grete nowmber of Grekis, & \u00fee goodes takyn. \u00dee kyng for \u00feat care coldit at his hert, And siket full sore with sylyng of teris, Henttes his horne and hastily blawes; Assemblit his sad men on a sop holle, Left the Grekes on \u00fee ground by the gray water: Soght to \u00fee Citie on soppes to-gedur Tho \u00feat left were on lyue \u00feogh \u00feai lite were. The kyng in his comyng kest vp his egh, Segh a batell full breme fro \u00fee burghe come Prickand full prest vppon proude stedys. He blusshed ouer backeward to \u00fee brode see, Se the Grekys come girdand with a grym noise, \u00deat fled were before & \u00fee fild leuyt. He was astonyet full stithly to be stad so, Betwene the batels on bent & so bare leuyt, Vmfoldyng with his fos \u00feat he ne fle might. \u00deen to batell on bent \u00feai busket anon, A felle fight & a fuerse fell hom betwene. But vnmete was the Macche at \u00fee mene tyme: The Grekes were grym, of a grete nowmber, And lite of \u00feat other lede, \u00feat on lyue were. The Troiens full tyte were tyrnyt to \u00fee grounde With batell on bothe halfes, blody beronyn, Wyde woundes & wete of hor wale dyntes.

THE DETH OF LAMYDON BY ERCULES. Tyll he come to \u00fee kyng in a kene yre, Dang hym derffly don in a ded hate, Grippit hym grymly, gird of his hede, \u00derew it into \u00feronge of his \u00fero pepull; \u00deat moche sorowe for \u00fee sight & sobbyng of teres, When \u00feaire kyng was kylt, hom be course felle. Sesit was the Citie, socour non \u00feere, \u00deaire fomen so felle, and so few other, The Grekes gird hom to grounde & to grym dethe: Of the dite & \u00fee dyn was dole to be-holde. The Troiens with tene turnyt \u00fee bake, ffleddon in fere and \u00fee filde leuyt, Ouer hilles & hethes into holte woddes, \u00deat left were on lyue with mony laithe hurtes, When the Grekys hade the gre & the grounde wonen. THE TAKYNG OF \u00deE TOWNE. Thai soght into the Cit\u00e9 vpon sere haluys, Streght into stretis and into stronge houses, There were wemen to wale, A wondurfull nowm|bur, Childer full choise and of chere febill, Wyth olde ffolke vnfere ferly to see. All tight to \u00fee tempull of \u00feere tore goddes, ffor drede of the dethe, & myche dynne made.

EXIONA, THE KINGES DOUGHTER LAMYDON. When the pales was put doun of \u00fee prise kyng, \u00deai fonde \u00feer a fre faire to be-holde, Euyn of his owne doughter Exiona was callid.

Ercules egerly euyn vponone Betoke hir to Telamon, for he the towne entrid, In reward as by right for his ranke wille. POETA. But caitif unclene, for thy curst dede!

When the toune was ouertyrnyt, takyn \u00fee godys, \u00dee Grekes to \u00fee gray water gyrdyn belyue; Shottyn into shippes all \u00fee shene godis, Launchet furthe lightly & the lond passit, Girdon ouer the grym waghes into grece samyn. All \u00feere lordes were light \u00feat \u00feai lyffe hade, ffayne of \u00feere fortune & \u00feere fine relikes, Didyn sacrifice solempne vnto sere goddes. All \u00feere Rewmes wax riche, hade relikes ynowe, And long tyme with hom last & \u00feere lefe children. When the Cit\u00e9 was sesit, as I said ere, And Lamydon the lege kyng out of lyfe broght, Wemyn & wale children vnto wo put, Set vnder seruage, sorow for euer, The kynges doughter caght & out of kythe led, And in horedam holdyn, harme was \u00fee more. Se now the sorow \u00feat \u00feere suet after; And yche wegh \u00feat is wise & of wit stable, Light harmes Let ouer-passe, Lap noght in yre ffor foly \u00feat may falle of a felle hert. A PROUERBE. A word \u00feat is wrappid, and in wrath holdyn, May feston as a fyre with a fuerse lowe, Of a sparke unaspied, spred vnder askys, May feston vp fyre to mony freike sorow; So lurkes with lordes of a light wrathe, \u00deat growes into gronnd harme, greuys full sore. (Happye) is \u00fee here In no hate lengis, MS. has \" happyn. \" Ne letis bele in his brest wherof bale rises, Ne mynnes no malis \u00feat is of mynd past; As yt happes here harme for to come, And wreke to be wroght for wordes a few; Soche a kyng to be kylde, A cuntre distroyed, ffele folke forfaren with a ffeble ende. Gyf an end hade ben now, & neuer noyet efter, Bothe of lure & of los, & oure lorde wolde, Hit was euyn bot a venture of Angur to come, And a Sesyn of sorow \u00feat \u00feere suet after. Right as Lamydon \u00fee lorde was of lyue broght, ffor he grethit with \u00fee Grekys \u00feat on his ground lay; So \u00feis Maidon shalbe mater of full mekull harme, And mony londes to lure \u00feat euer ho lyffe hade. Lo, how fortune is felle & of fer caste, \u00deat drawes in a dede hate in a derke wille, And of a litill hath likyng a low for to kyndull, \u00deat hepis into harme in a hond while! By \u00feis mater I meane what myschefe befell, \u00deere no cause was to ken but vnkynd wordes. And while \u00feis Lady was on lyffe in a lond fer, And all thies maters in mynde, \u00feat I mene here, Grete Troy was vp tild with mony toures vmbe, \u00deat was meruelously [made], & mekell to shew, And Sesyt was sython & to sorow broght, And mony kynges were kyld & knightes \u00feerfore. What ledys were lost & of lyue done, Now I turne for to telle, whill I tyme haue. OFF KING PRYAM & HIS CHILDREN. This Lamydon, \u00feat was lord, hade a lefe son, A pert man \u00feat was prinse, & priam he hight; A man witty & wise, wight, wildist in Armes. Hit felle hym [by] fortune at his fader dethe, He was faryn to fight in a fer londe, To riche hym of Rebelles \u00feat of \u00fee rewme held; To cache a castell \u00feat was kene holdyn, And to wyn it with werre, went \u00feere a while With his houshold hole, & here \u00feat he walt. He hade a woman to wyue worthy & noble, Onest & abill & Ecuba she hight: By \u00feat same hade he sonnes, semly men all, ffyue \u00feat were faire & fuerse men of armes, And \u00feree doghter by-dene \u00feat were dere holden. Of his sonnes to say or I sew ferre, Ector was oldist & heire to hym seluyn; And most is in mynd for his mykyll strenght. The secund of his sonnes sothely was parys, Or Alisaunder ewther was his other name; He was fairest of \u00fee freikes & a fyne archer, A bowman of \u00fee best & a buerne wise. The \u00ferid was a \u00fero knight, \u00ferivand in Armys, Deffebus \u00fee doughty on a derfe stede. The fourth was a philosoffer, a fyne man of lore, In \u00fee Syense full sad of \u00fee seuyn Artes.

Of his Deghter by dene, \u00feat were dere holdyn, One Creusa was cald kyndly by nome, \u00deat Eneas afterward Elit to wed, \u00deat spokyn is of specially in our spede after, And Virgill of his werkes writis also, After takyng of \u00fee toune how hym tid \u00feen. The secund of \u00fee suster for to say ferre, Cassandra was cald, clennest of wytte, \u00deat Enformet was faire of \u00fee fre artis, And hade knowyng by course of \u00fee clere sternys. The last of \u00feos lefe children was a lysse faire, Polexena the pert, prise of all other; Of hir ffeturs & fairhed is ferly to telle, Alse noble for \u00fee nonyst as nature cold deuyse Bothe of colour & clennes, to declare all. This prise kyng Priam hade of pert childer, Thretty sonnes besydes, als other wemen, \u00deat he gate on his gamen, goode men of Armys, And felle men in fight, as we shall fynd after. Now I turne to my tale & tary here a while.", "6": "There beginnys the Fyfte Boke: Of the Foundyng of new Troye and of the Qwerell of Kyng Priam ffor his ffader dethe. Now as \u00feis kyng vmbe the Castell lay closit abute, With his folke all in fere & his fyn childur, He was enformyt of \u00fee fare & of his fader dethe; How his towne was takon and tirnyt to grounde; His Suster sesyd and soght into syde londis; His knightes downe kylde vnto cold vrthe. Soche sikyng and sorow sanke in his hert, With pyt\u00e9 and complaint pyne for to here, He toke vp his tentes & the towne leuyt, Teght hom vnto Troy with tene \u00feat he hade, Segh the buyldynges brent & beton to ground. Soche wo for \u00feat werke \u00fean \u00fee wegh thowlit, \u00deat all his wongys were wete for weping of teres, Thre dayes \u00feroly, with thricching of hondys, And drowpet of dole as he degh wold. \u00deen he sesit of sychen & his sorow voidet, Mendit his mode & his mynd stablit, Toke councell in the case & his care leuyt.

But the fortune of feghters may be fell chaunse, And siker were to sit and solas vs here; But \u00fee harme and the hethyng of my kynd suster, \u00deat is set vnder seruage, & in syn holdyn, Greuys me so gretly & my greme ekys, \u00deat it reuys me my rest & my right hele.

Of all our dures \u00feai vs did & daunger for euer, All account and Enuy after to voide, Neuer to deire for \u00feat dede \u00fee dayes in our lyue.\" When the souerain hade said, \u00feen sesit he here, And it liket well the lordys & \u00fee ledis all: Of his wit & his wordes & his wise speche, In dede thus to do \u00feai demyt it all. When Priam hade persayuit all \u00feere pure wille, He chese hym a chere man the charge for to beire. Antenor he toke for his triet wit; He was gret, & graithe, & a gome noble, Wisest of wordes and will\u00e9 \u00feerto. He spake to hym specially, \u00feat he spede shuld With fauer and fair wordes his frenship to haue. And he lowted his lege with a low chere, And grauntid to go with a goode wille. HOW ANTENOR WENT ON MESSAGE TO THE GREKYS. Then he shope hym to ship in a sharp haste, And dressit for \u00fee depe as hym dere \u00feught; Halit into havyn in a hond while, Shippit hym full shortly & his shene folke; Grippit vp a gret sayle, glidis on \u00fee water, Sailet on soberly and \u00fee se past; Teght into Tessaile, turnyt into hauyn, There Pelleus \u00fee proude was a prise kyng. At Mansua for mirth in \u00fee mene tyme, A hauyn toun, as hap was, \u00feere \u00fee hind lay, Antenor not tariet ne no tome hade, But went to the wale kyng on his way sone, Hailsit hym hendly, & he his honde toke, And welcomyt hym worthely as a wegh noble, And fraynit hym with frendship qwat the fre wold. Antenor full tite told of his wille:\u2014 \"ffro Priam full prist put am I hider, As a messynger made at \u00feis mene tyme. Thus he sent me to say to your will euyn, ffor to mene to your mynde, as I most nede, The harmys and \u00fee heuenys hym happit of yow. ffirst of his fader, in fight was distroyet His Cite and his Syb men to sorow for eld; His londes, his legemen, out of lyue broght; His suster into seruage & to syn put; And o\u00feer Redurs full ryfe in his Rewme dyd. His golde and his goodis grippit also; Pikked all his prouynce & full pore leuyt, Withouten cause but of couetous, \u00feat come of your seluyn. Qwherfore, to qweme qwyt of all other, To skape out of skathe and sklaunder to falle, In obregyng of batell & buernes to saue, As ye ben wegh full of wit & for wise holdyn,\u2014 To send hym syster vne in sounde home, And all giltis for gyffen & greuanse for Ay.\" When Pelleus persayuit \u00feis in a proude yre, Sodenly he sourdit into soure greme, And Priam reprouyt as a pure fole, With hethyng and hate as hys hegh wordes. Antenor full tyte to trusse he comaundes, At the most in a moment of his mold passe, Or he doutles shold degh for his derfe wordys. Antenor vntomly turnet his way Withoutyn lowtyng or lefe, lengit he noght, But fast vppon fote ferkyt to shippe, And hasted to the hegh see in a hond while; Sailit on soundly as hym selfe lyket. On dayes and derke nightes dryuyn on the ythes, At Salame full sound \u00feai set into hauyn. That tyme in the towne was Telamon \u00fee kyng, To soiourne a season as hym selfe lyked. Antenor arghly auntrid of ship And wentto \u00feat worthy his wille for to shew. He welcomyt \u00feat wegh with a wille feble, ffor he louet not his lede of long tyme before: Yet he fraynit at \u00feat freike whedur he fare wolde, And the cause of his come to his courtte \u00fean. The Troiane full tumbly tolde hym Anone;\u2014 \"ffro Priam, full prist, haue I presit hedur, And wonen ouer the waghis his wille for to say, That in Troy truly is a triet kyng, And lord of \u00fee londe as be lyne olde; \u00deat now of youre nobilte newly desyres His Syster to be sent to his syde Rewme. \u00deat hynd for to helpe hertely he prayes, \u00deat ye kepe in youre company on vnclene wise, As subiecte vnto syn, vnsemyng for you.

To \u00fee courtte of \u00fee kyng come he beliue, His message for to make, as I mynt haue.

He highit full hastely & of his hond past; Shoke euyn into ship, & the shalke leuyt. A stithe man to the stere hade, & a stoute wynde, Were blouen to \u00fee brode se in a bir swithe. A TEMPAST ON \u00deE SEE. There a tempest hom toke on \u00fee torres hegh:\u2014 A rak and a royde wynde rose in hor saile, A myst & a merkenes was meruell to se; With a routond rayn ruthe to be holde, Thonret full throly with a thicke haile; With a leuenyng light as a low fyre, Blaset all the brode see as it bren wold. The flode with a felle cours flowet on hepis, Rose vppon rockes as any ranke hylles. So wode were the waghes & \u00fee wilde ythes, All was like to be lost, \u00feat no lond hade. The ship ay shot furth o \u00fee shire waghes, As qwo clymbe at a clyffe, or a clent hille,\u2014 Eft dump in the depe as all drowne wolde. Was no stightlyng with stere, ne no stithe ropes, Ne no sayle, \u00feat might serue for vnsound wedur. But all the buernes in the bote, as hom best liked, Besoght vnto sainttes & to sere goddes; With knelyng & crie to \u00feere kynd halowes, And with solempne sacrifice to seke \u00feai awowet. \u00dere dayes \u00feroly \u00feai \u00ferappit with stormys, Euer in point for to perysshe in the pale stremys; With daunger and drede duret vnder hacche, ffor wete of \u00fee waghes \u00feat wastis ouer hed.

So first will I found his fos for to greue, And couet it by course, as comys in my hert, With my body to by, and my byg strokes. On right hond shall hom reue \u00fee rest of \u00fee saule, That my graunser with greme gird vnto dethe, And sloghe all our Sitesyns, & our sad pepull Brittoned to bale dethe, and \u00feere blode shed. But faithful fader, & our fre kyng! I aske of you O thing,\u2014but angurs you noght,\u2014 Lettis mene to your mynde at \u00feis mene tyme, And consider to oure cause with a clene wit; Let oure gate be so gouernet, \u00feat no grem folow, Ne no torfer betyde, ne no tene after. Ouer lokes all lures to the last ende, What wull falle of \u00fee first furthe to \u00fee middis; Sue forthe to \u00fee secund, serche it with in, And loke to \u00fee last end, what lure may happyn. Hit is no counsell to encline, ne to calle wise, Ne not holsom, I hope, \u00feat hedis to \u00fee first, And for-sees not the fer end, what may falle after. What proffet any prowes with a prowde entre, To begyn any goode, on a ground febill, And fortune it faile, and haue a fowle ende? Hit is wit for to wayue soche a wilde counsell, And put of a purpos, \u00feat enpaire might, Or \u00feat wayueris in wer what shall worthe of; Licker at \u00fee last end in langore to bide, And turne vnto torfer, \u00feen any triet ioye.

There are not in Asia, to Ame all the pepull, So fele fightyng folke be a fuerse nowmber, As the Grekes may gedur & get when hom likes. Hit semes more sertain, sothely, to me, Yff we wackon vp werre with weghes so fele, That are bigger in batell, boldest in Armys, Hit may negh vs with noy, but neuer to our ioye. Lakys to our lyving, and likyng we haue Of pes & of prowes our prouyns aboute; Of Riches full ryfe, of rest at our wille; ffull stithe of astate, & stondyng at ese. Why couet we combraunse, or cachyng of harme, In enpayryng of our persons & pyllyng our goodes, And to put vs fro pes payne for to thowle? Sothely your suster sittes vs not so harde, 'To chaunge for hir choisly the cheuyst of vs here; Or all so myght Aunter to atter for euer.

THE VISYON OF PARIS. \"Hit is not meuyt of mynde ne mony day past, Syn I was leut in a londe, \u00feat is lefe ynde, Your biddyng to obey, as my blithe ffader. In the season of somer, er the sun rose, As it come into canser, and be course Entred, Hit fell me on a fryday to fare vppon huntyng. With myrthe in the mornyng & mony other pepull, All went we to wod the wilde for to cacche; And laburt full long, laytyng Aboute. Till mydday and more myght we not fynde, ffor to wyn as for waithe in \u00feat wode brode; Tyll hit entrid to euyn, & euynsong was past. Then it fell me by fortune, fer on a playne, As I beheld \u00feurgh a holte, a hert for to se, \u00deat pastured on a playn pertly hym one: And I cast me be course to cum hym before. ffast fro my felowes & fuersly I rode, Eu\u00feer lede hade I lost, & left me behynde, And swaruyt out swiftly, might no swayne folo. So I wilt in the wod and the wilde holtis, ffer fro my feres, and no freike herde, Till I drogh to a derke, and the dere lost. He \u00ferong into \u00feicke wodes, \u00feester with in, ffor thornes and tres I tynt hym belyue. Than I sesit of my sute, & softly doun light, Beheld to my horse, \u00feat hote was of Rennyng, All swoty for swyme and his swift course, That stremys from hym straght, & stert vppon \u00fee erthe, And dropis as dew or a danke rayne. All wery I wex and wyll of my gate, And raght to my reyne, richet o lenght, Bound vp my blonke to a bogh euyn; And graithed me to grounde as me gode liked, In a shadow of shene tres & of shyre floures, Ouer hild for \u00fee hete hengyng with leues. My bow \u00feat was bigge, & my bright qwyuer, Arowes and other geire atled I anon, Pight as a pyllow, put vnder my hede; And sleghly on slepe I slypped be lyue. I drow into a dreme, & dreghly me thought That mercury the mykill God, in \u00fee mene tyme, Thre goddes hade gotten goyng hym bye, That come in his company clere to beholde:\u2014 Venus the worthy, \u00feat wemen ay plesyn; And Palades, with pure wit \u00feat passes all other; And Jono, a iustis of ioyes in erthe. These ladis he lefte a litill besyde, And sothely hym seluyn said me thies wordes. 'To the, Paris, I appere with \u00fere prise goddes, That are stad in a strife here stondyng besyde; And haue put hom full plainly in \u00fei pure wit, To deme as \u00fee dere thinke & \u00feai in dede holde, When treuthe is determynet & tried by the. Thus it be fell hom by fortune, faire as I telle:\u2014 As \u00feai sate in hor solas samyn at a fest, An appull of a new shap, \u00feat neuer man hade sene, Coyntly by crafte was cast hom amonge. Hit was made of a mater meruell to shew, With grete letturs of Grece grauyn \u00feere vmbe. To rede it by reson rankes might se, That the fairest of \u00feo fele shull \u00feat fe haue: And duly this dome haue \u00feai done o \u00fei selfe, And put on \u00fei person hor pese for to make. The is hight for to haue highly by me, A mede of \u00feo mighty to mend the with All, As in rewarde for to ricche of hir \u00feat right has: That ye faithfully shall falle & not faile of. Yf \u00feou Juge it to Jono, this ioye shall \u00feou haue,\u2014 To be mightiest on molde, & most of all other:\u2014 This ho grauntis ye to gyffe of hir good wille.

Iff \u00feou deme it in dede duly to Venus, Hit shall falle the, to fortune, \u00fee fairest of Grice To haue and to holde, to \u00fei hegh mede.' When mercury hade menyt this mater to ende, And graunt me \u00feise gyftis hit gladit my hert. I onswaret hym esely euyn vponon:\u2014 'This dome is in dowte to demyng of me, The certayn to say, but I hom segh naked; And waited hom wele, \u00feo worthy togedur, The bodies aboute with my bright Ene.

Than nakuet anon full naitly were all, And broght to me bare:\u2014I blusshet hom on. I waited hom witterly, as me wele thoght, All feturs in fere of \u00feo fre ladys. Hit semit me for certayn, & for sothe dom, \u00deat Venus the vertuus was verely the fairest, Most excelent of other, and onest to wale: And I duli, be dom, demyt hir the appull. And ho fayn of \u00feat faire, & frely me het That the mede shuld be myne, \u00feat mercury sa\u00efde. \u00deen wightly \u00feai went. I wackonet with \u00feat, And grippet my gayre & my gate helde.

But I may sothely say, & for sure holde,\u2014 Hade the counsell ben kept of the knight Ector, And the Ernyst speche Eftward of Elinus the Bysshop, Cassandras care considret with all, With the prophesy of Protheus put into hertys, Troy with \u00fei toures hade bene a toune noble, And wond in his weile to the worldes ende. But no man tentes to tene er \u00fee tyme come, Ne ferd is for fortune till it falle to. And \u00feof hit chaunses to chefe \u00feat men charge litill, To grow into gronnd harme & greuys full sore; When the tene is be tyde, & turnys to \u00fee werst, Men demyn hit for destyny, & for due holdyn; And takon yt to \u00feat entent: & here a tale endes.", "8": "Here begynnes the Seuynt Boke: how Parys went into Grese for Elan. Envy, \u00feat Euermore ertis to skathe, Ryxles full Ryfe in her ranke hertes. This forward was festynit with a felle wille, And all the purpos plainly with pouer to wende. Hit betid \u00feus in tyme, as I telle shall, When sit was [the] Sun \u00feese signes betwene, Entred in yades, efter as it fell; And the planet of pliades, with his playn course, Into taure was turnyt as the tyme asket. In the moneth of May, when medoes bene grene, And all florisshet with floures \u00fee fildes aboute; Burions of bowes brethit full swete, fflorisshet full faire; frutes were kuyt; Greuys were grene, & \u00fee ground hilde; Hit was likyng in Laundys ledys to walke; Parys the pert knight, And his pure brother, Comyn vnto courtte with company grete, Of thre thowsaund \u00fero knightes, \u00feriuand in Armys; The pruddist of payone, prise men of honde. Shippes were shot furth on the shyre water, All boune on the brode see, with botys amonge. To nem you the mowmber naytely be tale, There were twenty and too, to twyn hom in sonder, Stithe shippes & stoure stuffet with vitell, All full vpon flote with fyne pepull in. The kyng comaund to come, & cald hym anon, Antenor alstite, and Aunteros Eneas, And Polidamos prist,\u2014a full pert knight, Antenor Aune son, aldist of yeris; Bade hom buske & be boun & no bode make, To pas furthe with parys & hor prise knightes, Bowne on hor best wise in hor bright wedis. And \u00feai grauntid the grete with a glad chere, And shope hom to ship in a sharpe haste. All the pepull to appere Pryam comaundit, That were purpast to pas on the pale stremys, And wightly thies wordes warpit hom to, With a Sembland full sad, er he ses wold:\u2014 \"Hit nedys not now our noyes to telle, Ne mony wordes to warpe, for it is well knowen. All wete ye my wille why ye wend shall, The Grekes for to grefe, if your grace happe, And harme with your hond, \u00feat our hede slogh; To venge of our velany, & our vile grem And hardlaike we hade of hom in \u00feis londe: And most is my mynde, & I might haue, My Sister Exiona fro seruage to brynge.

Paris with pyne, & his pure brother, Toke leue at \u00feere lege with loutyng & teris; Shot into ship with shene men of Armys; Lauset loupis fro the le; lachyn in Ancres; Brode sailes vp braid; bonkis \u00feai leuyt. With Jono, the Juste god Joynet to \u00fee see, And Venus the worthy, \u00feat hom well plesit, Thay sailed furth soundly with seasonable wyndes, Tyll \u00feai comyn of the cost of Caucleda in spase:\u2014 Of the regione of Rene, & rode \u00feere in havyn. Gayn vnto Grese on \u00fee gray water, By the Regions of Rene rode \u00feai ferre, Streit by the stremys of the stithe londys; Ay boun to the banke, when hom best thoght, ffor to light on \u00fee londe, & leng on hor ese. Now it felle hom by fortune, as \u00feai fere so, Monolay for to mete, the mightiest of Grese, Come sayland by syde & the see held; Purpost vnto Pyle by prayer of Nestor, MS. has Pire To solas hym a season, & soiourne with the Duke. This Menelay, \u00feat I mene, the mighty before, To Agamenon the graithe was a gay brother; And had weddit, I wis, & to wif held Elan, \u00feat afturward angert hym sore. Of hir feirehede & feturs is ferly to here, I shall telle you, when I tyme haue, tomly her|aftur. Ho was suster for sothe, as I said ere, To Pollux the pert kyng, & his pere Castor, \u00deat soiournet the same tyme at the Cite Emscor, As legis in hor owne londes, a louely hom with,\u2014 Ermonia, a Maydon \u00feat \u00feai moche louyt,\u2014 A doghter full dere of dame Elan the quene. When the Grekes se the grete nauy, \u00feai girdon o rowme, And meuyt fro \u00feere metyng at the mene tyme. Nawther company by course hade Kennyng of other, But past to \u00feere purpos & no prise made, And sailet vpon syde vnto sere costys. Parys and his pepull past by the stremys, Hadyn wynd at hor wille, & the wedur calme, And sailet to Sithera, and set into hauyn; A ground of the Grekes, as hom grase felle, And now cald is, by course, of hom \u00feat costes hauntyn, Sytrinos forsothe, with Sailers to nome. There arofe all the rowte, as \u00feai rede toke, And halit into hauyn, & houyt full stille; Caste ancres full kene with cables to grounde; ffestonit the flete, as hom fayre thoght; Buskys into botys, were borne to \u00fee lond, To solas hom a season, as hom selfe liked; And waited vppon hor wirdes for wynnyng of godys. In Sythera, for sothe, was a solempne tempull, Of Venus, I wis, \u00feat worthy was holdyn, ffoundet before, fele yeres past, And enabit of old \u00feere auntres were sene. With Riches full Rife & myche Ranke godys, The yle well enabit & onest with in, And lyuet after law of \u00fee lell gentils, \u00deat Venus the worthy worshippit for god, And most honouret of other with onest\u00e9 \u00feere. There auntered hom oft, onsware to haue, When \u00feai put hom with prayer \u00feat prise for to seche. Thus tyd hit \u00feat tyme, as I telle wille, \u00deat the principall & prise fest of \u00feere pure goddys Was holdyn \u00feo high dayes with hom \u00feat \u00feere dwelt; And other folke vpon fer fell thedur thicke, With mykull prese of pepull of prouynce aboute, Soght to \u00feat solenit\u00e9 sacrifis to make. Worthy wemen to wale, wete ye forsothe, \u00deat prist are of pilgrymes to pas ouer lond To waite after wondres, & wilfull desyre More Janglyng of Japes \u00feen any Juste werkes, And for solas & sight \u00feen sacrifice to do. When parys persayuit had the pepull anon, He cacchis a compony clenely arayed, And to the tempull full tyte toke he \u00fee gate. ffull mylde on his maner meuit within. On a side he hym set, as semyt for a straungior, In prayers full prist the pepull beheld. He offert onestly in honour of Venus, A gobet of gold, \u00feat gyngys might se; And sylid for-sothe on the same wise, ffor solempnite of sacrifice in sight of \u00fee pepull. Paris was pure faire, & plesaund in sight, A store man & a stoute, full stithe hym be semyt; ffairest be ferre of his fre buernes, Wemen waited hym well, hade wondur of hym one, That of shap for to shew was shene to beholde, And clad as a kyng in clothys full fyne. He was louyt with ladys, lappit in hert. As course is of kynd & comyn dessire, Ich on fraynet at his fere \u00fee frekys to know, Of what lond were \u00feo louely hit list hom to wete, And prinsipall of Parys the pepull dessiret, Of \u00feat comly to Ken, & his cause here. And o sithen it was said, & for sothe tolde, That Parys was Pryam son, \u00feat prinse is of Troy, By comaundement of his kyng comyn into Grese, With a company clene his cosyn to gete. Exiona sothely he soght for to haue, That Telamon hade takon & with tene held, And set vnder seruage \u00feat hom sore greuyt. This speche furth sprede & sprange vppo ferre, Ouer all into yles, so aunter befelle, Into the Eres of Elan hit entrid belyue. The prishede of parys was praisit so mekyll, With ferly of his fairnes, & his fre buernes, Sho was lappit in longyng \u00feat louely to se, And to wete of \u00feat worthy with wilfull desyre. As wemen are wount in Wantonhede yet, With a likyng full light in loue for to falle, That hetys into hertys and hurtes sone after; So longid this lady with lust to the Temple, With Sacrafice solempne to seche vnto Venus. This ho tolde hir entent, as \u00fee tyme asket, And to stare o \u00feo stoute, & hir astate shewe To the folke of the frigie with a ffrike wille: Holdur \u00feen holynes happont so then. THE POIET. Hit is wondur to wit of wemen dissyre, \u00deat shunt not for shame to shake ouer lande, To glogh vppon gomes at gedering of folke, And prese vnto playes pepull to beholde, \u00deat ledis vnto loue with lustes \u00feat folowes. Yong men & yepe, yenerus in hert, Rauisshe hom Radly & \u00feaire rede turnys; Puttes hom to purpos \u00feat pynes hom after. Soche stirrynges ger stumble, \u00feat stidfast wold be. With sight at assemblis, & sythen with speche, With flatery, & faire wordys fallyn to gedur, Acoyntyng hom with kissyng & clippyng in Armes, With Sossyngs, & Sotelte, Settyng of cases, The willes of wemen wightly \u00feai chaunge, To falle vpon foly & hor fame lose: Now fey be \u00fee freike \u00feat it first ordant. Soche Riot & Revell so ryuely to haunt, Of yonge men & yenerus, \u00feat yurnes to gaumes To daunse amonge damsels; drawing of glovis, With comonyng in company, \u00feat comes but to harme, Gers maidnes be mart, mariage for done; Brynges wyues into wondur \u00feaire worship to lose; And ertes ay to euyll ende & ernyst by the last. Throgh whiche treason betydes, & ternys vm|qwhile Bolde men to batell and biker with hond: \u00deat draghes vnto dethe, & deris full mony. Therfore saintes to seche and to sere halowes, And turne vnto Templis atyrit with pride, \u00deof it be laifull to ladys and o\u00feer les wemen, &YOGH;et it ledis vnto laithnes and vnlefe werkes; And shotis into shame as shene has ben ofte. But \u00feou Elan, \u00feat haldyn was hede of all ladys, And the fairest of feturs formyt in erthe, What wrixlit \u00fei wit & \u00fei wille chaunget, In absens of \u00fei souerayne, for saghes of pepull, To pas of \u00fei palays & \u00fei prise chamber, To loke on any lede of a londe straunge? \u00deat might faire haue refraynit with \u00fei fre wille; Haue sauyt thy septur & \u00fei selfe alse. Hade \u00feou holdyn \u00fee at home, hedit \u00fein astate, And not cayret fro court \u00feere company was gedurt, To waite aftur wondurs for a worde light. Hit were sittyng for sothe, & semly for wemen, \u00deaire houses to haunt & holde hom with in; Kepe hom from company & comonyng of folke; And, ouer all, \u00feere onesty attell to saue, Whethir a ship, \u00feat is shot on \u00fee shire wawes, Shuld drowne in the depe, & it drye stode, Halyt into havyn, harlit with ropes. Ne a woman, I wis, \u00feat wisely will gouerne, Shall not into fame but of hir fre wille. Thou dissyret full depely, dame Elan, \u00fei seluon To pas fro \u00fei palis & \u00fei priuey chamber, And seche to Sytheria with solempne Avowe; In colour of \u00fei cause \u00feou couet to se \u00deat straunge, \u00feat was stoute & stare hym vppon; So \u00feou light in vnlefulnes, \u00feat lefully semyt, Thurgh \u00fei Licrus lust \u00feat Lurkit in \u00fei hert. ffor \u00fee sight of \u00feat semely, sotheli, was venum, \u00deat enfecte \u00fei faire loue to \u00fee fairist of Grise, And mony Greke with grem vnto grounde broght All the frigies vnfaire vnder fight endit. Now furder how it felle I will faire telle.\u2014 Sho assemblid hir seruandes with a sad wille, Hade hom radly arayed for \u00fee rode furth; Bryng horses to grounde and hernes anon, To seche to Sitheria for solempne avowe; And Venus to worship, as hir wele awe, As ho heghly hade het for helping before. This Sitheria, for sothe, from \u00fee same yle Of Menelay \u00fee mighty was but a mene spas, And he souerain hym selfe & \u00fee soile aght. Tite, with outyn tariyng, atirit were all, Horses in haste & to hond brought; The lady full louely was lifte vppon on, A palfray of prise, prudly atyrit, And glod on full gayly, \u00fee gaynist to the bonke. There light \u00feai full lyfely, lept into bote, And were set ouer soundly into the same yle Right with a Rother, and Rayket to bonke. In hir atire to \u00fee tempull tomly ho yode, \u00deere onestly sho offert, honourt hir goddes With giftes of golde & of gode stones; Tariet in the tempull, tentit to goumes; Ho segh not \u00feat semly, \u00feen set hir to ground And proffert hir prayers to \u00fee prise goddes. These tythandes full titely told were to Parys, \u00deat honerable Elan was entrid in \u00fee tempull,\u2014 Menelay mody wife \u00feat he most louyt. He araiet hym full riolly with a route noble, And past thurgh \u00fee prese into \u00fee proud tempull. He was enformyt before of \u00feat fre lady, \u00deat ho to Castor \u00fee kyng accounttid was euon, And to Pollux: pure suster pristly to bothe. Of hir fairehede feltymes hade \u00fee freike herd. ffro he \u00fee semly hade sene he set so his egh, He proffert no prayer to no prise goddis, Ne hedyt noght hertely but \u00fee hend lady; Ne no lede on to loke saue lelly hir one. THE FAIRNES OF ELAN. All the feturs of \u00feat fre was fourmyt so well, And ho of fairnes so fele was ferly to se. The here of hir hede, huyt as the gold, Bost out vppon brede bright on to loke: The shede \u00feurghe the shyre here shone as \u00fee lilly, Streght as a strike, straght \u00feurgh the myddes, Depertid the proudfall pertly in two, Atiret in tressis trusset full faire. Hir forhed full fresshe & fre to be-holde, Quitter to qweme \u00feen \u00fee white snaw, Nou\u00feer lynes ne lerkes but full lell streght; With browes full brent, brightist of hewe, Semyt as \u00feai set were sotely with honde, Comyng in Compas, & in course Rounde, ffull metly made & mesured betwene, Bright as the brent gold enbowet \u00feai were. Hir ene wull full onest euyn of a mesure, Shynyng full shene as \u00fee shire sternys, Or any staring stone \u00feat stithe is of vertue; ffull sutelly set, Serklyt with heris On the browes so bryght, borduret full clene, Stondyng full stepe and stable of chere. Hir nose for the nonest was nobly shapyn, Stondyng full streght & not of stor lenght, Ne to short for to shew in a shene mesure; Noght growen to grete ne to grefe smalle; With thrilles noght thrat but thriftily made,\u2014 Nawther to wyde ne to wan, but as hom well semyt. Hir chekes full choise, as the chalke white, As the rose, was the rud \u00feat raiked hom in,\u2014 Mengit with mesure in hir mylde face To the lippus full luffly, as by lyn wroght, Made of a meane vmb \u00fee mowthe swete, As it were coruyn by crafte, colourd with honde, Proporcionet pertly with painteres deuyse. To telle of hir tethe \u00feat tryetly were set, Alse qwyte & qwem as any qwalle bon; Wele cumpast in cours & clenly to gedur By rule in \u00fee rede gomys, as a rose faire, \u00deat with lefes of \u00fee lylly were lappit by twene. Hir chyn full choise was the chekys benethe, With a dympull full derne, daynt\u00e9 to se. In the hew of \u00feat hend was a hegh ioye Of faiernes so fele in hir face shewide. The slote of hir slegh brest sleght for to showe, As any cristall clere, \u00feat clene was of hewe, Shene for to shew & of shap noble. With a necke for \u00fee nonest of naturs deuyse, Glissonand as the glemes \u00feat glenttes of \u00fee snaw; Naw\u00feer fulsom, ne fat, but fetis & round, ffull metely made of a meane lenght. With shulders full shaply, shenest of hewe, ffull pleasaund & playn, with a plase lawe Goyng downe as a goter fro the gorge euyn. Hir armys were auenaund & abill of shap, Large of a lenght, louely to shewe. Hir hondes fetis & faire, with fingurs full small, With nailes at the ne\u00feer endes as a nepe white. The brede of hir brest, bright on to loke, Was pleasaund & playne pluttide a litull, ffresshe and of fyne hew as \u00fee fome clere: With two propur pappes, as a peire rounde, ffetis and faire, of fauour full swete. Hir corse [was] comly & of clene shap, Euyn metely made of a medill deuyse, As nobly to \u00fee nethur-most as nature cold shape. Parys stode in a stody & streght on hir lokit, ffaste by \u00feat fre fresshe of araye; Beheld hir full hertely, hade no rewarde To prayer, ne pepull, ne prayer within. So he hedit \u00feat hynde, & ho hym agayne With a lokyng on lenght in hor loue ene, \u00deat Paris ho pryset in hir pure mynde, Of feturs & fourme fairer by myche, \u00dean he vppon hir hertely couthe fynde: And thus ho thought full thrange in hir thro hert, \u00deat so semely a sight ho se neuer before, Ne so comly a creature to hir clene wit, Ne no lede to hir lykyng halfe so luff-able. Ho tentit not in Tempull to no tall prayers, Ne no melody of mouthe made at \u00fee tyme, Ne speche of no spiritualtie, with speciall ne other; But ay staryt O \u00feat stoute with hire stepe Ene. There most was hir mynd in \u00feat mene qwhile; And Parys perceyuit the print of hir sight, And lokit on \u00feat louely with a light chere, Till aither sight was sadly set vppon other. So be lokyng of lenght with a loue chere, Ayther kyndly by course knew o\u00feer wille. Then Parys pertly proffert a seigne, ffor to telle his entent yf ho tome hade; And ho onswaret \u00feat Abill after agayne, By seignes on the same wise soburly to come; And beckonet hym boldly, when bourdys were thicke, And pepull in play, his place to Remeve. Parys listinet lyuely, let for no shame, But drogh to \u00feat dere & dressit to sitte, And softly by him selfe said what him liket. MS. has ' hom ' While o\u00feer tentid in the temple tomly to playes, And noght hedit \u00feat hynde hertely in loue, And \u00feai hade laisure at lust \u00feere likyng to say, And wrixle \u00feere wit & \u00feere wille shewe: Ayther vnto o\u00feer arghit hom noght. \u00deai were assentid full sone sittyng to gedur, And festoned \u00feere forward how \u00feai fare sholde. \u00dean pertid \u00feai priuely, Paris toke leue, And loutid \u00feat louely, & ho hur luf kyste. The knight with his company kayred fro \u00fee tempull, And sho beheld to \u00feat hynd houyng full stille, Lokyng on lenght with a loue ee, Ay folowyng on fer till he was forthe past. THE RAUYSHYNG OF ELANE. Then Parys forthe past proude at his hert, Wele laburt with loue longit full sore; Evyn shoke to his shippes \u00feere shene men were in, And gedurt all the great greidly anon, And said hom full soberly, er he sese wolde, Thes wordys I wis, as ye wete shalle:\u2014 \"Now faithfull felowes, & my fre buernes! Hit is knowen to you kendly \u00fee cause of our iourney, Why Pryam has put vs \u00fees partis vnto. This was truly his entent, & takon vs in charge, His sister Exiona to sese & we might, By any Way in this worlde & Wirdis vs demyt: And if vs happynt not hir to haue at our wille, The Grekes for to greue on sum gret wise, With all \u00fee might \u00feat we may our malice to kythe. And O nowise may we wyn \u00feat woman to gete, Withouten batell full bigge & a breme oste. Telamon, the tore kyng, tentes hir so wele, And is fuerser of folke by a felle nowmber, And lappis in hir loue, \u00feat leue hir he nyll But with strenght of strokys, or with store fight; And we ledis to lyte \u00feat lady to wyn, Or any Cit\u00e9 to sese by a sawte now, \u00deere pepull are so plaintiose, & placis of strenght. And, sers, syn he so is be souerans of goddis, Vs may falle here by fortune a fulfaire gifte, \u00deat shuld lelly be laght, as me leue thinke.

The most of tho mighty is menelai wife, Lady of \u00feis lond, full louely to shew, The grettist of grese and a gai qwhene. Yf we take this full tite, & tary no lengur, Bothe pepull & pilage, & put into ship, Hit is a proffitable pray of persons me thinke, And godis full grete of gold & of syluer; ffor the tempull is atyret all with tryet clothes, Bassons of bright gold, & o\u00feer brode vessell, Chaundelers full chefe, & charbokill stones, And other Riches full Rife \u00feat we may rad haue: What fairer shuld vs falle and we fer soght.

When counsell was kaght of knightes & o\u00feer, And all things examynt, so aunter befell, The neght drow negh anon vppon \u00feis, And the mone in the merke myghtely shone, As come it by course, & cast a gret light. \u00deai armyt hom at all peces abill to werre; To the tempull full tite token \u00feere gate, Prayen & piken all the pure godes; Affrayet the folke fuersly by dene, Sesit & slogh, slongen to ground; Grippit the godys and the gay ladys, And all the company clene closit hom within. Parys \u00feen presit to \u00fee proude qwene, And sesit hir sone, as hir assent was; Led hir furth lyuely, lefte hir in shippe Vnder sight of sure men set hir to kepe: And to the tempull full tyte turnyt agayne, To rob of \u00fee Riches, and Renkes to helpe.

THE SHAPE AND COLOUR OF THE KYNGES OF GRECE. Agamynon \u00fee gay was of a gode mykull; His colour of \u00feat kyng all of clene qwite. He was store man of strenght, stoutest in armes, With lymes full large; light of his will, Meke as a maiden, mery with all; Wode in his wrathe, wild as a lion, He was witty \u00feer with, & wegh hardy, And of faciund full faire, fre of his speche. Menelay the mighty was of meane shap, Noght so large of his lymes as his lefe brother; In mesure was made of a medull size, Betwene the large & the litill; likyng of colour Auntrus in armys, eger of wer, A bolde man in batell, & of breme wille. Achilles the choise was of chere faire, Likyng & luffly, a large man with all. Crispe herit was the kyng, colouret as gold. Stokyn ene out stepe with a streught loke; His loke was full louely, when ledys were opyn. With a brest \u00feat was brode, byg of his shulders; Grete armys in the gripe, growen full rounde; A large man of lenght with limis full brode. A stythe man in stoure, storest of wille, Was no greke on \u00feat grounde of so great strenght, Ay bowne vnto batell, boldist in armys, Godely of giftes, grettist in expense, Ay furse on his fos, and to fight Redy. Tantelus the tore kyng was a tulke hoge, Borly of brede, & of big strenght; Wele colouret by course, clene of his face, Rede roicond in white, as \u00fee Roose fresshe; With grete Ene & gray, gleyit a litill; Meke of his maners, & manly in werre. Aiax oelius was outrage grete, Brode of his brest, byg in his armys; A large man of lyms, lengest of stature. Costius clothyng ay \u00fee kyng weiret; Noght lowrand with laithe chere lese for to speike. Telamon truly was a tulke full faire, Blake horit, aboue breghis and other Serklyt of hom seluyn, semly with all. A Sotell man of song with mony sere notys, And mellit hym with musike & myrthes also. He was doughty of dedys, derfe of his hond; Pompe and proude wordis ay \u00fee prinse hated. Ulexes the lefe kyng was loueliest of other, He was the fairest by ferre of all the felle grekes, And falsest in his fare, and full of disseit. Vndertaker of treyne, of talkyng but litill, Neuer myrth in his mouthe meuyt with tong: Sad of his semblaundes, sober of chere. And of facound fairest with a fre speche, He hade no make of \u00feo men in meuyng of wordys. Dyamede \u00fee doughty was a dere kyng, Stronge of his stature, stithe in his armys, Brode in his brest, byg in his shulders, With a loke \u00feat was laithe like out of wit. ffals of his forward, felle of his hond, A derffe man in dede, dyssirus of batell. Vnsober with seruaundes, sorofull in hert, Dredfull in dole for dissait \u00feat he vsit. Lusty to lechery, vnlell of his trouthe, And mony harmes hepit for hete of his loue. Off Duke Nestor to deme, doughty in werre, He was long & large, with lemys full grete. A ffreike \u00feat was fre, and a feire speiker, Wise in his wordys, witt\u00e9 of counsaille; Tru of his trowthe, tristy to loue, Meke of his maners malise to pese; And if he walte into wrathe, wode as a lyon, But he lengit not long in his lothe hate; ffaithfull of frendship to frekys \u00feat he louyt, The hertist to helpe of all the high kynges. Protheselus the pert kyng was of pure shap, Semely for sothe, & of Syse faire. Doughty of dedis, derfe of his hondes, None wighter in werre, ne of wille bettur. Neptolon nobill was non of \u00fee lest: A store man of stature, stabill of chere. His here was hard blake, on his hede stode. Grete Ene and gray, with a grym loke. Rounde sydes for sothe, sober of wille; His shulders were shapon of a clene brede. Bytell browet was the buerne, \u00feat aboue met; And stutid full stithly, \u00feat stynt hym to speke; But he was lernyd of \u00fee lawe, & in his londe wise; ffor to comyn in a case hade a clere wit. Palomydon the pure, he was prinse faire; Naulus son \u00fee nobill kyng, & his next childe. Vne made of a mene in the medyll shap, Large of a lenght, lyuely & small, Noght borely ne brode, but as hym best semyt. A stythe man of his stature, stirond of wille, Menyt hym to mony thinges, & of mynde gode; Nobill talker with tales, tretable alse, Curtas & kynde, curious of honde. Polidarius was pluccid as a porke fat, ffull grete in the grippe, all of grese hoge. So bolnet was his body, \u00feat burthen hade ynoghe The fete of \u00feat freke to ferke hym aboute, Or stond vppo streght for his strong charge. Aparty was he proude, presit after seruys, He wold not gladly be glad, ne glide into myrthe; But euermore ymaginand & entrond in thoghtes. Machaon the mody kyng was of a mene stature, Noght to long ne to litle, lusty to se, Proude & presumptius, prouyt of wille, Ballit was the buerne with a brode face; Neuer slept \u00feat slegh for slouthe vppon day. Dares in his dytyng duly \u00feus tellus, \u00deat for the helpe of these hende, & hertely of o\u00feer, Of Perse come the proude kyng with pepull full mony, And a company of knightes comly to se, \u00deat tellis his Atyre & his triet strenght. He was large, & long, & of lene shap, With a face somwhat fat, fellist of colour. The here of \u00feat hathell was huet as \u00fee fire, Bothe o berde & aboue all of bright rede. Of the tulkes of Troy telle we now ferre, Bothe of mesure & mykyll whille I mynde haue, As breuyt is in boke and aboue set, ffull duly by Dares endited of olde. Priam \u00fee prise kyng was of pure shap, A large man & a longe, liuely & small. A faire man in feturs & hade of furse steuyn. Wight in his werkes & of wit redy; Delited to the deuer on dayes be tyme. Noght ferfull, ne furse, faueret full wele, Louet he no lede \u00feat lustide in wrange; He rulet hym by Reason & the right spake. Songis of solemnite and songes of myrthe He wold herkon full hertely in his high wit. Was neuer kyng vnder cloude his knightes more louet, Ne gretter of giftes to his goode men, Ne lellier louyt ledys of his aune, Ne with Riches so Rife rewardet his pepull. Of all his sones for sothe, \u00feat semely were holdyn, Non was so noble, ne of nait strenght, As Ector, \u00fee eldist, & aire to hym seluyn. He was truly in his tyme tristiest of other \u00deat leuit in any londe, & a litle he stotid. This prinse with his pure strenght plainly auer|come All Auntres in Armys, \u00feat he euer raght: Non so stuerne \u00feat withstode a stroke of his honde. He was massy & mekull, made for \u00fee nonest, Neuer Troy no tyme soche a tulke bred, So graithe, ne so good, ne of so gret myght. Ruly & rightwise, a roghe man of hors, He spake neuer dispituosly, ne spiset no man; Ne warpit neuer worde of wrang with his mowthe. Ne sagh, \u00feat was vnsemond, slipped hym fro, But ay meke as a maydon, & mylde of his speche. Neuer hatfull to hym to hygh into batell, Neuer wery of \u00feat werke, ne of wegh fferde, He swat neuer for \u00feat swynke, ne in swayme felle. Was neuer red in no Romanse of Renke vpon erthe So well louyt with all ledys, \u00feat in his lond dwelt. Parys was pure faire, and a pert knighte; Here huet on his hede as haspis of silke, And in sighkyng it shone as the shyre golde. He was bowman O \u00fee best, bolde with a speire, A wilde man to wale, wode on his fos; ffull siker at asaye, & a sad knight, Of hunters he was hede, & hauntyd it ofte. Deffebus was doughty & derfe of his hond, The \u00ferid son of \u00fee sute, & his sure brother Elenus, the eldist euyn after hym. \u00deo freikes were fourmet of feturs [a]like, Bothe of hyde & of hew to hede of a mykell; ffor, to loke on \u00fee ledys with a light egh, The ton fro \u00fee tother was tore for to ken In sight at \u00feat sodan, somyn & \u00feai were. The fourme of \u00feo freikes was, faithfully to se, Right suche as the syre, \u00feat I said first; Vndifferent to deme fro \u00feere dere fader, Saue Priam the prise was past into eld, And \u00feai of yeris full yong, &yogh;euerus of wille. The ton was a triet knight, tristy in armys, A wight man for to wale, & wise of his dedis; The tother, sotele of syense to seke in a lond, And a corius clerke with a clene wit. Troilus \u00fee tru was full tore mekull, ffull massely made, & of mayn strenght; And yet hoger of hert & of her wille, He demenyt well his maners, & be mesure wroght. Amirous vnto Maidens, & mony hym louyt, And delited hym in dole with damsels ofte; But he mesuret his maners, \u00feof he \u00fee myrth vsid, \u00deat it impairyt not his person, ne his purpos lettid. In strenght ne in stryfe \u00feere strokes were delte, He was Ector eftsones, or ellis soche another. In all the kyngdome & cuntre, \u00feat to \u00fee coron longit, Was no yong man so &yogh;epe, ne &yogh;enerus of dedis, Ne so hardy of hond holdyn in his tyme. Eneas was euermore eger of wille, Brode in his brest, & of body litill. Wise in his werkes, & of wordys sober, A faire speiker in a spede, speciall of wit, A clene man of counsell, with a cloise hert, Of litterure & langage lurnyt ynoghe. A man full of mekenes & mery of his chere. ffaire Ene hade \u00fee freike, & of fyn colour, Glemyt as \u00fee glasse and gliet a little. Of all the tulkes of Troy, to telle \u00feem by name, Was non so riche of Renttes, ne of renke godes, Of castels full close, & mony clene tounes. Antenor also was abill man of wit, Long man & large, lyuely & small. Mony wordys hade the wegh, wise of his dedis, In fele thinges forwise, & a fer caster. Wele louyt of his lege, delited hym in myrthe, Bourdfull among buernes, blithe of his wordis, Hethyngfull to hathels, but it harmyt not. Polidamas \u00fee pert \u00feat was his prise son, ffull &yogh;ener and &yogh;epe, and a yong knight, ffaire man of fassure, & of fyn strenght, Worshipfull in wer, wise of his dedis; A large man of lenght, delyuer, & small, Euyn fourmyt as his fader of feturs & other. A full strong man in stoure, sturnyst in Armys, Wrothe with a worde & away sone: His colour blent was in blake, with a blithe chere. Merion the mighty kyng was massely shapen, A faire man of fourme, & a fre knight. Grete sydes to gripe growen full sad, Brode shulders aboue, big of his armys, A hard brest hade \u00fee buerne, & his back sware. Crispe heris & clene, all in cours yelowe, All the borders blake of his bright ene. A felle man in fight, fuerse on his enimys, And in batell full bigge, & myche bale wroght: Grete worship he wan while the wer laste. Ecuba, the onest & onerable qwene, Was shewyng in shap of a shene brede, Massily made as a man lyke. She hade a wonderfull wit a woman to bene, Alse sad in \u00fee syens as semyt for a lady Wele norisshed \u00feerwith; wise of hir dedis, Meke of hir maners, myldest of chere; Onest ouerall, as aght hir astate, An delited hir deply in dedis of charit\u00e9. Andromaca, auenonde abill of person, Worthy Ector wyfe, was a we faire. Long body hade the burdde, bright of hir colour. Ho was mesurably made, as \u00fee mylke white. Hir ene flamyng fresshe, as any fyne stones. Rud as \u00fee Roose roikede in hir chekes. Hir lippes were louely littid with rede. Gilde hores hade \u00feat gay, godely to se. Most onest of other euer in hir tyme, And all hir dedis full duly done by a mesure. Cassandra the clere was a Clene Maydon, Semely of a Sise, as the silke white, Womonly wroght, waike of hir colour, Godely of gouernaunce, and gleyit a litle. Of wemen werkes wilnet ho none, Most was hir mynde hir maidonhede to kepe. Mony cas for to cum ho be course wiste, By artys of astronomy, & ame of hir wit,\u2014 By staryng on the sternys thurgh hir stithe lore. Polexena the pert was prise of all other, Of feturs & fourme the fairest on lyue; ffull tendur of hir tyme, triet of hewe. Of hir fairnes fele may no freike telle, Ne no wegh has wit ne wordys \u00feerfore, ffor to labur so longe of hir lefe shap; But truly I telle as \u00fee text sais, Ho was of bewte aboue all borne in hir tyme, To wale \u00feurgh the world of wemen bydene, Alse noble for \u00fee nonest as natur cold deuyse, To paint in yche place thurgh his pure study, (\u00deat errit not in anythyng of abilt\u00e9 \u00feer, Saue he demyt hir dedly, when hir day come.) And ay cheriste hir chastit\u00e9 with a choise wille, To \u00feat abundaunse of bewte ho was best norisshed.

Throgh the glorious gyfte of goddes son of heuyn, That come to our kynde throgh a cleane Maydon, All maumentre in myddelerthe myrtlit to peses MS. has \" pes .\" And wastid away \u00feurgh wit of hym one, As the gospell of God, \u00feat gabbis not, says. When Heraude in Anger atlede to sle Cryste \u00feurgh his curstnes, as \u00fee clause tellus, An angell anon neghed to Jasep, Sent fro \u00fee souerayn \u00feat in Cel\u00e9 dwelles, To take the childe for a chaunse & his choise moder, And euyn into Egypt entre on his way. When Criste in \u00feat contre come with his dame, The false goddes in fere fell to \u00fee ground; Bothe Mawhownus & maumettes myrtild in peces. Isai also oponly tellus, When Jesu Egipte Joynit with in, All Symylacres for sothe soghten to ground. \u00deat was a tokyn, he tellus, fro tyme of his come, \u00deat sacrifice shuld sese vnto ser goddis. \u00deus the Jewes aiugen, & for iust holdyn, \u00deat ysmaiell, of all men erst hom, began Maumettes to make of moldes & clay.

The furst \u00feat was founden of \u00fees fals goddes, Was wroght on \u00feis wise, as weghes can tell. OFF BEALL THE GOD & BELSABUB. On Delus, a derfe Kyng \u00feat deghit in eld, Or Belus, as \u00fee boke says, (bothe were his namys) Hade a son \u00feat hym sewit, sesit in his lond, Nine was his name, & his next heire. He brought hym to berynes on his best wise, As be-come for a kyng, closit hym faire With solempne sepulcre, sothely wroght. And for his fader shuld faithly be fer in his mynd, An ymage a noble anon gert he make, All grauyn of gold, & of good stonys, Vne of mesure & mykyll, of his myld fader. ffull solemly set in the sight of the pepull, With worship on all wise, \u00feat worthy comaundit To all the pepull of his prouyns, as a prise god. That ymage to honour he ordant hym seluyn, And gert the ledis to beleue, \u00feat in his lond dwelt, \u00deat the gome was a god groundet in blisse. And so the ffigur of his fader was falsly honouryt, By assent of hym selfe \u00feat the soile aght; And \u00feen the fynde, with his falshed & his fer cast, Entrid in \u00feat ymage, & onswaret the pepull. Who \u00feat any thing asket after his dissyre, \u00deere onswaret opunly the aungell of helle: And so the ledis of the lond lyuely hym cald, Sum beall, sum belus, sum bell \u00fee god, Sum belphegor, & belsabub, as hom best likes. In ensample of \u00feat same sithyn other folke Haue feynit mony fals goddes, \u00feat \u00fee fynde plesit, Did honour to dedemen, & for dere holdyn. And \u00fee sun the saidon sothely a god, \u00deat appollo the pepull put into nome, \u00deat is honouret in the yle, \u00feat I of telle, Delphon, or Delos, dem as ye list. And \u00fean Venus the worthy is worshippit with sum, \u00deat of planettes of prise has hor pure nome. \u00deen mercury, a mighty god, is most in honour, \u00deat \u00feai saidon was sun sothely to Jobiter. Then the mone was most made for to please, That Diana full duly \u00feai demyt to hat. And \u00feus in costes & cuntreis of \u00fee cursit gentils, \u00deai sought with sacrifice vnto sere goddes. In Egipt was honourt Ysum as god, An in the cuntre of Crete cald vpon Jubiter. The men of Mawsom most honret ymbane, And \u00fee latyn lede loutid to faawn. At Rome \u00feai Reuerenst vppon riche wise One qwirion, a qwicke fynde, & qwemly did serue; At attens all folke aykewardly worshippid Minerva, a maument & most on hym leuyt; At pauy, a pure god the pepull cald Venus; At Lemno \u00feai loutid to a laithe fynde, On Volcaun \u00feai worshippit on \u00feere wise most. At Vaxor \u00fee vayn pepull voidly honourit Bachian, a bale fynde, as a blist god. And at Delphon, duly, for derrest of other, Appollyn was honourit, as I here said. In yche yle vppon erthe, eftur hor deuise, Thai made mowmettes of mold in mynd of hor goddes, And honourit ouer all thyng as \u00feere belefe askit. Thus \u00feurgh falshed of \u00fee fendes \u00fee folke was dissayuit, Vnder daunger of \u00fee dule droupet full longe, Of whose falshede & fourme in his first makyng Will I somwhat say, & sithen of his falle. (But \u00fee fader, \u00feat first fourmyt all thinge,\u2014 Both the ayre, & Element, & Angells in heuyn, Water, & wynde, & welkyn aboue,\u2014 In the highest heuyn, as holy writ sais, He ordant angels after his deuyse, And set hom in seruice hym seluyn to honour. But on the oddist of other ordant our lord, Brightest of bemes in blisse for to dwelle. Of whom the proffet of prise plainly can say, \u00deere was no sterne in astate stode hym aboue, Ne no pert tre in peradise apperith to hym, Ne burione ne braunche to his beamys like.) God fourmet hym so faire, as I fynd here, \u00deat mony legions his light launchet aboue. Thurgh his fairhede as fast he felle into pride, When he said of hym selfe his sete he wold make ffull noble in \u00fee north, \u00feat non shuld be here Like to \u00fee lord, \u00feat the light made; Euynyng in all thing euyn with hym selfe, Sone he fell of his faire-hede, & fele of his peres, \u00deat assentid to \u00feat syn, sonkyn in fire. Mony legion \u00feere light vnto laithe fendes With lucifer, \u00feat lyuet in delites aboue, \u00deat wofully welt & woundid to the dethe. Thus the gospell of God of \u00feat grym tellis,\u2014 'I segh satan hym selfe slippe out of heuyn, As \u00fee leuenynges light, \u00feat laches to ground.' This fende was the first \u00feat felle for his pride, And lost has his lykyng, \u00feat lyuyaton is cald. And for the case is vnknowen be course to \u00fee lewd, Here sumwhat I say, er I sew ferre. And ysidre in ethemoleger openly tellis, \u00deat bemoth in Ebrew ys opunly to say,\u2014 ' A Roid beste vnreasonable , \u00feat no Rule holdes.' And for \u00fee fende was so fals & full of dissait, God at the begynnyng of his gret falle, Wroght hym to a worme in wildurnes like, Writhen, as the writte sayes, like a wilde Eddur. And for grettnes of \u00feat Grym in his grete filthe, He is demyt a Dragon with Dauid the prophete. In his song of the sawter \u00feere he sais \u00feus,\u2014 'This Dragon of Dissait, \u00feat \u00feou derfly hath fourmet': So sethe in the sauter the Salme to the end. And loke of lyuyaton in the lyffe of saynt Brandon, There \u00feis warloghe, I wis, a water eddur is cald, \u00deat \u00feis saint \u00feere seghe in the se occiane, ffull large and long of a lawe depnes. Closet \u00feere be comaundement of his clene maker, Vnto the day of dom dulfully to abide, Writhyn is \u00feat warloghe with wilis ynoghe, Mannes saule to dissaiue & in syn holde. \u00deis lyuyatan, leder of all thies laithe fyndes, To our fader the first fell\u00e9 in Envy, And put hym to peradise pristly anon To tempt hom with trayn, \u00feat trist of non euyll, To forfet \u00feat faire place & offense make. Hade a face vne fourmet as a fre maydon, And as a sprite in hor spake, \u00feat spede to our harme, Or barly toke body of \u00feat bold eddur, And so with falshede & faire our faders dissayuit, And all \u00feere successours sorily sent vnto pyne. Of \u00feis mater of mawmentry nomore at this tyme: \u00deis sufficis forsothe. Ses we now here, And turne to our tale & take \u00feere we lefte. Thus be dissayt of the deuyll, as I declaret haue, This appollo apperit to pepull full ofte In Delphon, or Delos, dem as ye list. To \u00feis appollo, \u00fee pure god, \u00feat pepull honouret, Thies kynges by course comyn anon, \u00deat messengers were made fro \u00fee maisters of Grece, And turnyt into tempull fro \u00feere tore shippis. Be counsell of the kepers, when the course felle, \u00deat serued \u00feat Synagod to the sory fyndes, Than entrid \u00feai with honour, & offerond made, Grete soumes forsothe of siluer & of golde; Did \u00feere deuocioun as hom dere thought, And frayned at the fynd how \u00feai fare shuld, Of \u00feaire Journay, full Justly, a Juggement to haue. And \u00feen Appollo apperith with a priue voise To \u00feo worthy, o this wise, as \u00fee writ sayes. THE ANSWARE OF APPOLLO TO ACHYLLES. \"Achilles! Achilles!

And your graithnes may gretly the grekes auaile, With counsell & comyng in cas \u00feat will falle, Till \u00feai haue wonen hor will: wete \u00feou for sothe.\" And when Calcas with comyng hade kyndly persayuit \u00deat Achilles the choise was in the chere temple, He wentto \u00feat worthy his wille for to shewe; And euyn told hym by tale as hym tide hade. And felle of affynite, and fryndes be-come, Achilles with chere cherisshed hym full mekull, And hight hym hoge thinge to haue at his wille. \u00deus went \u00feay to water, \u00feose wise men to gedur, Cacched in cables & \u00feere kene ancres, Sesit vp \u00feere sailes, & in sound Rowet, Past ouer the pale stremys & no payne tholet.

When sodenly the softe aire vnsoberly rose; The cloudis ouer cast, claterrit aboute; Wyndes full wodely walt vp the ythes; Wex merke as the mydnighte mystes full thicke; Thunret in the thestur throly with all; With a launchant laite lightonyd the water; And a Ropand rayne raiked fro the heuyn.

Hade wedur at \u00feaire wille, wentton to ship, And past fro \u00feat port the pepull in fere; Halit to the high se in a hond while; Sailit on soundly as hom self list, Tyll \u00feai comyn to the cost & countre of Troy; And \u00feere hyt into hauyn as hom happe felle, Vnder a castell of \u00fee cuntre, \u00feat cald was Saracbla. There \u00feai fastnet the flete & the furse shippes, Cachit hom with cables & castyng of ancres, And logget hom to lenge in \u00feat le hauyn. The kepars of the castell caghten \u00feere armys, Wentten out wightly the water to kepe; Bowet to the bonke in hor bright geire. To put of \u00feat pepull pristly \u00feai wend, And foryn as folis; for \u00feai but few were. \u00deai with stode hom a stoure but it stad litle. The folke were so fele, \u00feat felle to the londe, Armyt at all peces, angarly mony, The troiens \u00feai tokyn & tirnyt to dethe, And fell to the flight in fere to the castell. But the Grekes on \u00fee grounde grymly pursueyt, Swappit hom with swordes till the swalt all. Comyn to the castell, (vnclose were the yatis, The cuntremen for to kepe as \u00feai cum wold,) The Grekes Ingird, gripped the warders, And all the fonnet folke fell to the dethe; Slogh hom doune sleghly, slang hom to ground; Robbit \u00feere riches, raght to \u00feere shippes. Wonen to the walles, walt hom to ground; Betyn doune the buyldynges to the bare erthe; Tokyn the tresure; turnyt into hauyn. When \u00feis castell was caght, kylled the pepull, And all the shalkes to ship with the shene godes, \u00deai past fro \u00feat port with pillage \u00feai hade, And turnyt vnto tenydon, taryt no lengur. \u00deere arof all the rowte with \u00feere Ranke shippes, Cast ancres with cables \u00feat kene were of byt; Let sailes doune slide; slippit into botes; ffestnet with fuerse Ropis the flete in \u00fee hauyn; And buskit vnto banke, the boldist ay first. At this tenydon truly was a tried castell, Wele wroght for the werre with walles full stronge; Evyn fild full of folke, fuerse men & noble, And Riches full Rife, Ranke men with in; Wele viteld, I-wisse, for winturs ynoghe. (Hit was sothely but sex myle fro the Cit\u00e9 euyn, As I told haue tomly in a tale here before.) The folke in \u00feat fuerse hold were ferde of hom selfe, Arait hom full radly, right to the werre. In defense of hor fos, \u00feat on flete lay, Wenton out wightly wale men of armys, And bateld hom on the banke as hom best thught. When the Grekes were gethurt & to ground comen, Mony fightyng folke in a fuerse nowmbur, The pepull with hor power put hom agayne, And foght with hom felly, \u00feof \u00feai few were. Bold was \u00feat biker opon bothe haluys. Mony deid by-dene of the derfe grekes; And Troiens with tene tynt of hor pepull, But not so fele at \u00fee first as of the ferre side. The Grekes full greatly greuyt \u00feerat, Oppresset hom with payne & preset \u00feereafter; ffought full felly, and fele were \u00feere \u00feai sl\u00e1yne: Of the Troiens \u00feat tyme tynt were \u00fee mo. The fresshe was so felle of the furse grekes, And the nowmber so noyous, \u00feat neghed in hast, That the ffrigies floghen and the fild leuyt; Turnyt vnto Troy, and the toune entrid. And \u00feo at fore not to flight, ne of forse were, The grekes gird hom to grounde with hor grym swerdes, And brittenit on the bent, \u00feat abide wold. Comyn to the castell, vnclosit it aboute, ffoghten with the folke, \u00feat defens made. Shottyn vp sharply at the shene wallis With glayues; & gomes girdyn doun toures; Dryuen vp dartes, gyffen depe woundes. With alblasteris also amyt full streght, Whappet in wharles, whellit the pepull. With speris full dispitiously spurnit at the yates, Dongen on dernly with mony dede hurtes, In diffens of \u00fee folke, \u00feat affroi made. But the wallis the[y] were for all the wo yet, And fele of hor fos fellyn with out. \u00deen gone forthe the grekes, graithet engynes, Batold hom all abrode vmbe the bare walles; Layn ladders alenght & oloft wonnen. At yche cornell of \u00fee castell was crusshyng of weppon; ffell was the feght \u00feo fuerse men amonge; Mony grekes in \u00feere grem\u00fe gird on the hed, Till \u00feai lept of the ladder, light in the dyke, The brayne out brast & the brethe leuyt; And mony dongen to dethe with dynttes of honde. The Troiens full tit were tirghit for fight, Wondit & wer\u00e9 \u00feat \u00feai were noght; And the grekes in so grete nowmber gedrit hom till, Wonyn on the wallis wightly with ladders, At wyndous on yche syde-wise a wondurfull nombur, The grete toures \u00feai toke, tirnyt the pepull: Was no lede opon lyfe \u00feat a lofte stode.

When all counsels were kyde and carpit to end, \u00deai didyn after Dyamede, & demyt hit \u00fee best, \u00deat said hom full sadly all in softe wordes:\u2014 \"Ye worthy to wale, wonder me thinke, Of our dedis so dull why we dure here! Now is &yogh;epely a yere yarket to end, Syn we light in this lond & logget our seluyn, And neuer dressid, ne drogh, to no dede ferre; Ne so hardy, fro \u00feis hauyn to hale on our fos,\u2014 ffor to turne vnto Troy, ne on \u00fee toun loke. What dede haue we don, or dryuen to an end; Or \u00fee farrer in our fare fortherit our seluyn? But ertid our Enmys, & angert hom noght; Made hom wiser of werre, ware of our dedys, And by compas to caste to conquere vs all. We sothely haue sene, & our selfe knowen, Syn we come to \u00feis coste & cairet no ferre, The Troiens haue atiret hom with myche tor strenght, \u00deaire Cit\u00e9 to saue, and hom selfe alse, With new wallis vp wroght, water before, And pals haue \u00feai pight, with pittis and caves, And other wilis of werre wroght for our sake, That may hast vs to harme, & hindur our spede With all fare \u00feat may forthir, & filsyn our seluyn. \u00deai holdyn vs vnhardy hom for to negh, Or with note for to noye now at \u00feis tyme: And ay the ferrer \u00feat we fay our fare opon longe, The more we procure our payne & our pure shame. \u00deis I hope in my hert & holly beleue, Hade we sailit all somyn to \u00fee Cit\u00e9 euyn, In our course as we came, & cast vs \u00feerfore, We shuld lightlier haue laght \u00fee lond at our wille: Or any we hade ben warre, wonen of ship Withouten hurt other harme to haue in the dede, Or any lede to be lost, or hor lyue tyne. Now are the war of our werkes, wetyn vs at hond, Vs will gayne mykell greme er we ground haue: And ay the ser \u00feat we sit our sore be \u00fee harder. Therfore, sothely me semys, yf ye so wille, \u00deat we dresse to our dede when \u00fee day sprynges; All redy to rode, aray for our shippes, Iche wegh in his wede, as hym well likes, All boune vnto batell on his best wise. Row forthe in a rape right to the banke, Tit vnto Troy, tary no lengur; And monly with might meve vnto londe, The ground for to get, gaynis vs non other. If the Troiens with tene turne for to fight, We wynnyt not of water but with wight strokes; And with fightyng full fell with a fuerse pepull, To set vp on yche syde vppon sere haluys. \u00deerfor, lause of our lyuys, leng we not here; Put of all purpos, prese on our gate! This bus duly be done, dem we non other, Syn we wyn to our wille be no way ellis.\" All plesit the prinse with his prise wordes, And the dom, \u00feat he dulte, duly was kept. When the derke was done, and the day sprange, All the renkes to row redyn hor shippes, Halit out of hauyn to the hegh see, There plainly thaire purpos putto an end. Who fare shuld be-fore, of \u00feo felle kynges, And wo kepit his cours for to caire after, Thus demyt thes dukes on the depe water:\u2014 A hundrith of hede shippes to hale on before, Sadly to saile on \u00fee salt waghes, With baners o brede bret for \u00fee werre; The forcastels full of fuerse men of armys, With shot & with shildis shalkes to noy. Ano\u00feer hundrith, anon, negh sone aftur, With sailes vp set on \u00fee same wise, All wroght for the werre & wight men \u00feerin. \u00deen folowet all the flete fast oponon, Euyn kepyn hor course, as \u00feai kend were, Turnet euyn to \u00fee toune, tariet no lengur, Till o sithen \u00feai segh \u00fee Cit\u00e9 at hond, And the bonkes aboute to \u00fee bare walles. Then \u00feai turnyt hor tacle tomly to ground, Leton sailes doun slide, slippit into botes, Launchet vp to the lond lyuel\u00e9 bedene, Buernes buskit vnto bonke; bold men in hast, Thoght \u00fee ground for to gete, & no grem suffer. THE HARD ARIVALL OF THE GREKES. But the Troiens, truly, \u00fees tourfer beheld, How the fflete of \u00feere fos fell to \u00fee bonke, And armyt hom [at] all peces abill to fight; Lepon vpon light horses, lappit in stele; Withouten leue of the lege, or \u00fee leffe prince, Bowet euyn to \u00fee banke or \u00feai bide wold; Out of rule or aray raungit on lenght. The Grekes in the gret shippes graidly beheld, Segh the pepull so plaintiouse, presaund in armes, The bonke to forbede, bold men ynow: Thai hade meruell full mekyll in hor mynd all, To se the gouernaunce graithe, & the grete chere, How wisely \u00feo werriours wroghten vndur shild. There was no Greke so grym, ne of so gret wille, Durst abate on \u00feo buernes, ne to bonke stride; Ne afforse hym with fight to ferke out of ship. But for hom gaynet no ground to get at \u00fee tyme, But \u00feurghe strenght of strokes, & of strong fight, And with batell full big on a breme wise, \u00deai armyt hom at all peces all the ost well, Wonyn to \u00feere weppons wyghtly by-dene, And girdyn vp to \u00fee ground with hor grete shippes. Prothessalon the proude, of Philace was kyng, He was formast on flete with the first hundrith, \u00deat boldly to bonke braidis to fight. But his shippes were shent with a sharpe wynd, Gird on the ground with so grym wille, Till \u00feai rut on a Rocke, & rent all to peses, \u00deat mony was mard & the men drownet: Vne sunkyn in \u00fee se mony sure knightes. And who, \u00feat lacchit the lond with the lyf \u00feen, Were takon with the Troiens & tyrnet to dethe, Martrid & murthrid, manglit in peses. \u00deen the fight wex fell \u00feo fuerse men amonge, With shot fro the shippes and the shire banke. Of Arowes & Awblasters \u00fee aire wex thicke, And dynnyt with dyntes, \u00feat delte were \u00feat tyme. The rynels wex red of the ronke blode, \u00deat were slayne in the slicche, & in slym lightyn. There sothely was sene what sorow & pyne, And how balfull & bittur the banke was to wyn. How the grekes were gird vnto grym dethe, Neuer red was in Romanse with no renke yet, That any weghes in the world, \u00feat to werre yode, With soche baret, fro \u00fee bote vnto bank wan, As hit happit here with so hard fight. But the secund sort sothely, \u00feat sewet hom aftur, Were graither of gouernaunce, grippet hor sailes, And light vnto lond lyuely and sound. More wisely \u00feai wroght \u00feurgh warnyng before. \u00deai preset vp proudly with panys in hond, In refut of hor felowes, \u00feat were foule mart; And the Troiens tyt turnyt hom agayne, ffor-bode hom the banke with mony bale dintes. \u00deai braid to \u00feere bowes, bold men in hast, With alblastis also atlet to shote, With big bowes of brake bykrit full hard, Lacchet on \u00fee ledis, \u00feat on lofte stode, Hurt hom full hidiously, hurlet hom abake. There were ded of \u00feo dyntes, mony derfe knightes. The shalkes for \u00fee shot shont fro \u00fee banke, And the grekes vp gird in a gret nowmber, ffell fuersly to fight, & hor felowes halpe, \u00deo \u00feat left vpon lyue, \u00feof \u00feai lyte were. \u00deen gird \u00feai to-gedur with a grym fare! ffull fell was the fight with \u00feo fuerse troiens. Prothesselon, \u00fee prise kyng, preuyt his strenght, There wonderfully wroght his weghis to helpe; Mony Troiens with tene tyrnyt to ground, Thurgh swap of his sword swaltyn belyue! Mony doughty were ded with dynt of his hond, And myche fortherit his feris in hor fell angur! Hade not the freike ben so fuerse with his fell dyntes, All the grekes hade ben gird vnto grym dethe, And all brittnet yche ben, \u00feat were to banke comyn. But what fortherit his fight, \u00feof he fell were, With seven thowsaund \u00fero men \u00ferongen to-gedur, \u00deere a hundrith hole were on a hepe somyn All triet men of Troy \u00feat hom tene wroght? Mony dynttes full dedly delt were anon! The Grekes were gird doun, & on ground lay, Mony swonyng, & swalt, & in swym felle. The grekes were so greuyt, & to grem broght, \u00deai wold fayn haue ben forthe, fled on hor way, But no wise might \u00feo weghis wyn into ship; Ne to lepe fro \u00fee lond into \u00fee low se, Hit was not holsom for hom, so hard was the stour! Hom was leuer on \u00fee lond leng at hor aunter, And be brittnet in batell, \u00feen burbull in the flod. \u00deai fell fuersly to fight, \u00feo few \u00feat \u00feere were, And put all \u00feere pouer, pynyt hom sore. The Troiens dong hom doun in the depe slithe, Mony lost hor lyues, & light in the water, And were ded in the depe withouten dyn more. The might was so mekyll of \u00feo mayn Troiens, \u00deai hade no strenght to withstond, ne hor stid holde, But all borne were \u00feai backe to \u00fee buerne syde, And hade deghit by-dene with dynttes of hond; But Archelaus in armys auntrid to banke, And fell vnto fight his feris to helpe. Now batell on bent \u00feo buernes betwene, The grevans was gret \u00feo grekes among; Assemblit were sone \u00fee same in \u00fee fight, And restorit full stithly \u00fee stuff of \u00fee grekes. ffell was the fight & fuerse hom agaynes, And mony deghit with dynt of \u00feo derfe pepull: Mony harmys \u00feai hent er hor helpe come. \u00deen Nestor anon neghit to lond, With his shippis full shene, & sharpe men of armys, Hard hastid to helpe with heturly wille, And sodainly with his sort soght into batell! Speiris into sprottes spronge ouer hede; Arowes vp in the aire ysshit full \u00feicke; Swordis, with swapping, swaruyt on helmes; The dede, vnder dynttes, dusshit to ground; Cloudis with the clamour claterit aboue, Of the dit & \u00fee dyn, \u00feat to dethe went! Prothenor the prise kyng, & proud Archelaus, Mony tolke of \u00fee Troiens tyrnyt to dethe. \u00deen Ascalus & Alacus auntrid to lond, And aryuen full rad with \u00feere rank shippes: With \u00feere pouer full prist past fro \u00fee water, Brusshet into batell, & myche bale wroght. So felly in fere foghtyn \u00feo two, Obacke went the batell of \u00fee burghe folke; But \u00feere were fele other fresshe, \u00feat no fight touchit, \u00deat gird into the grekes with a grym will, And all backward hom bere to \u00fee buerne side, \u00deat fer from \u00fee flode might no freke wyn. Then Vlexes come vp vne with his folke, Wan out of \u00fee water & his weghis all, And braid into batell with a brem wille. Sharpe was the shoure the sheltrun [amonge]! The Grekes geton hor ground, \u00feat [graidly was lost], And myche comford hom the co[m of \u00feat kene knight]. Mony woundes \u00feai wroght, [and warpit to dethe]! Vlixes with vtteraunse vnder [his shild], Mony stithe in stoure stroke on [\u00feere helmes]; Launsit, as a lyoun, \u00feat were [lengen aboute], And of the ffrigies fell with [his fuerse dinttes]: Sum he stroke in the stoure streght to \u00fee erthe; Sum dange to the dethe, & derit full mykyll. The proud kyng of Pafligon persayuit his dede,\u2014 One Philmene, a freike of the ferre halue,\u2014 He gird hym to ground with a grym speire; And he fell vppon fote, faght with the kyng. And Philmene the fuerse, with a fell dynt, Vttrid Vlixes vne in the place, \u00deat hit shot \u00ferough the shilde & \u00fee shire maile, To \u00fee bare of \u00fee body, \u00feat the blade folowet; And he gird to \u00fee ground with a grym hurt, Hade no strenght for to stond, &yogh;et he stert vp, And frusshit at Philmene with a fyn launse. With all the might & the mayn, \u00feat the mon hade, He hit hym so hetturly on hegh on the shild, \u00deat he breke \u00feurgh the burd to the bare throte; Hurlet \u00feurghe the hawbergh, hurt hym full sore; The gret vayne of his gorge gird vne ysondur, \u00deat the freike, with the frusshe, fell of his horse, Halfe ded of the dynt, dusshet to ground. The Troiens for \u00feat tulke had tene at hor hert; Kayron euyn to the kyng, caght hym belyue; Harlet hym fro horsfet, had hym away. [He] for ded of \u00fee dynt was drest on his shild, [And bou]rne on the burde to \u00fee burgh hom; [For the de]the of \u00feis duke doll was ynogh [That trublit \u00fee] Troiens with tene, trist ye no nother [Myche harm to \u00feem] happit here at \u00feis tyme! [The Grekes were] so grym \u00feat were to ground comyn, [Mony dukes were] ded of \u00fee derfe Troiens. [\u00dean Toa]x of Toil\u00e9 Telemon the kyng, [Agamynon, &] Aiax, & all o\u00feer shippis, [Come launchond to] lonnd and hor lordes all: And Menelaus the mighty, & his men hole, ffull radly arofe, raiked to lond; Halet vp horses, highet olofte; And fellon vnto fight \u00feere feres to helpe, \u00deat were strongly be-stad in a stoure hoge. To the Troiens \u00feai turnyt & mekill tene wroght! The frusshe was so felle, \u00feo fuerse men betwene, Crakkyng of cristis, crusshyng of speiris, The clynke & \u00fee clamour claterit in the aire, And with dynttes of derfe men dynnet the erthe; Mony Troiens with tene were tyrnyt to ground, Sum ded of \u00feo dynttes, sum depe woundit;\u2014 Restoret the stithe batell strongly anon, And mony dongen to dethe of the derfe Troiens. Then Prothessalon \u00fee prise kyng, \u00feat preset to lond ffirst in the forward, \u00feat his folke lost, He was wery for-wroght, & woundet full sore,\u2014 Hade laburt so longe, hym list for to rest,\u2014 And bowet fro the batell to \u00fee bonke side, ffor to beld hym on \u00fee bent, & his brethe take. And o sithen he soght to \u00fee se euyn, \u00deere \u00fee fight was first, & the folke drounet; \u00deen he plainly persayuit his pepull were ded,\u2014 \u00deat no lede of \u00feat lordes vppon lyue was. Soche a sorowe of \u00feat sight sanke to his hert, \u00deat his wedis wex wete of his wan teris, And he, stithely astonyt, stert into yre; More breme to \u00fee batell his baret to venge, Of his folke \u00feat were fallyn vnto fell dethe, Hard highet vnto horse with a hert \u00fero, fforto felle of \u00fee ffrigies felly he \u00feoght. Onon with a naked sword neghit to batell, Vne wode of his wit as a wild lyon, Mony breme on \u00fee bent brittoned to ground. Mony kild the kyng in his clene yre! Myche tene \u00fee Troiens tid of his hond! Then Perses the proude kyng prise mon of ynde, With a batell of bowmen fro the burgh come, And with a fernet fare fell to \u00fee stoure. At whose come the cuntre-men comford were all, And restoret the stithe fight stuernly agayn; As fresshe to \u00feere fos as at the first tyme, Gird to the Grekes, & moche grem wroght; Woundit hom wikkedly, walt hom to ground, Oppresset hom with pyne, put hom abake, All the batell to \u00fee bonke, & mony buerne slogh. \u00deere the grekes hade ben grymly gird vnto dethe, Ne hade Palomedon, the prise kyng, preset to lond, With fele fightyng folke of fuerse men of armys; Halet vp horses hard out of bote, Wonyn on wightly, wentyn to batell, His folke to refresshe with a fyn wille. The assembly was sorer o \u00fee se banke; Mony deghit full dernly, dole to be-holde! Then the grekes agayne geton \u00feere hertes, And myche comford kaght of his come \u00feen. This Palomydon paynyt hym pepull to slee, And mony woundys he wroght in his wild yre. He soght to on Symagon, a sad mon of armys,\u2014 Kyng Merion \u00fee mighty was his met brother, \u00deat fele had confoundit of the fuerse grekes;\u2014 He bere to \u00fee bold with a big sworde, And rof \u00feurgh the Ribbes right to \u00fee hert, \u00deat he fell of his horse flat to \u00fee ground, Deghit of \u00fee dynt, & deiret no moo. Palomydon preset furth into \u00fee prise batell; Mony tulke out of Troy tyrnyt to dethe; Mony knight don cast to \u00fee cold erthe. All were ferd of \u00fee freike, fled of his way; Durst no buerne on hym bate for his bold dedis. Myche clamour & crye was kyde in \u00fee ost, \u00deat the Troiens for tene might tary no lengur; But with prise of Palomydon put all abake, And fer in the fight fell hom the worse, Vne boun fro \u00fee batell busket to fle, Vntill Ector eris hit entrid belyue The great noise of \u00fee noy, \u00feat in note was. He lepe on a light horse lyuely enarmyt, And soght to \u00fee se banke to socur his pepull; Wode in his wrathe wynnys into batell! All shone his shilde & his shene armur, Glissenond of gold with a glayre hoge: Thre lions the lord bare all of light goulis, \u00deat were shapon on his shild, shalkes to be|holde. He gird to the grekes with a grym yre; In the brest of the batell, \u00feere buernes were thicke, He ffrusshet so felly freikes to ground; Made wayes full wide \u00fee weghis among; Shot thurgh the sheltrons, shent of \u00fee pepull. To Prothesselon he preset, \u00feat pepull hade slayn, And myche wo had wroght on \u00fee wild troiens. THE DETHE OF PROTHESSOLON BY ECTOR SLAYN. He swappit at hym swithe with a swerd felle; Hit on his hede a full hard dynt; Clefe \u00feurghe the criste & the clene maile; Slit hym down sleghly thurghe the slote euyn, Bode at the belt stid, and the buerne deghit. Then leuet he the lede, launchet on ferre, Mony dange to the dede with dynt of his hond: Who happit hym to hitte harmyt nomo. Mony brem in the batell britnet to dethe, Sundrit the soppis vnsarkonly with hondes: All gird of his gate, gevyn hym the way. Iche freike of \u00feat furse fraynit at other, \u00deat our folke \u00feus felly flynges to ground: \u00deen \u00feai knowen by course of his clene shap, \u00deat it was Ector the honerable, eddist of knightes. Thai fled fro the fase of his felle dynttes, So bold was no buerne his bir to withstond, Ne \u00fee caupe of his kene sword kast hom to mete. Whill he bode in the batell, \u00fee buerne with his honde Mony grekes with grem he gird to the dethe. All failit \u00feere forse, feblit \u00feere herttes, The batell on backe was borne to \u00fee se. Then wery he wex, & of his werke hote, Bowet fro the batell, & his buernes leuyt. The sun in his sercle set vndurnethe; The light wex las, he leuyt the fild, Soght to \u00fee Cit\u00e9 soberly & faire, Left his feris in \u00fee fild fightyng full hard. Then grekes agayne getton \u00feere herttes, ffrushet \u00fee ffrigies felly to ground; So hit tid hom tensiche betymys \u00feat day. But \u00fee Troiens full tore turnyt agayne, ffoghten so felly, frunt hom o backe, Kyld mony knightes, cacchit on hard, Greuyt so the grekes, \u00feai graithet to fle, Were borne to \u00fee banke with baret ynogh. Then Achilles the choise cheuyt to land, With his shippes in a sheltrun, & skalkes within; Gird vp to \u00fee ground with a grym fare, With \u00fere thowsaund \u00fero men \u00ferist\u00e9 in armys; ffell to \u00fee fight on a fuerse wise. Myche tene the Troiens tid of his hond! The grekes keuriyt for comford by comyng of hym. ffell was the fight \u00feo frekes betwene! Mony gird to \u00fee ground, and to grym dethe; Mony lede out of lyue light on the erthe! The stoure was so stithe \u00feo strong men among, That full mekull was the murthe, & mony were ded. The Troiens full tyte were tyrnit to ground: Thurghe Achilles chiualry hom cheuyt the worse. Mony fell \u00feat freike with his fuerse dynttes! Myche blode on the bent, bale for to se; Of myrthe & of murnyng thurgh might of hym one. Then the last of \u00feo lefe shippis launchit to bonke, And all the fighting folke fell to \u00fee lond; Gyrdyn in grymly into grete batell. The multitude was so mykyll at \u00fee mene tyme, Of the grekes vppon ground, & of grym folke, The Troiens for tene tyrnyt the backe, ffleddon in fere, & the filde leuyt; All somyn to the Cit\u00e9 soghten by-dene, With myche clamur & crie for care of hor dethe. Mony warchond wound, and wer\u00e9 at all, Mony chivalrous Achilles choppit to dethe: All his wedis were wete of \u00feaire wan blode! As \u00feai flaghe in the filde, \u00fee freke with his hond, So he gird hom to ground with a grym sword, To \u00fee Cit\u00e9 forsothe, cessit \u00feai noght. Moche angre at the entr\u00e9 auntrid to falle, To the Troiens with tene, er \u00feai toun entred. Myche slaghte in the slade, & slyngyng of horse! Mony derfe \u00feere deghit, was dole to beholde! ffull myche was the murthe, & more hade \u00feere bene, Hade not Troilus the tene turnyt to fight, And Paris the prise with pepull ynogh, With Deffebus the derfe, of dedis full felle, \u00deat fell to \u00fee frusshe of \u00fee fuerse grekes; Issuet out egurly, angret full mony, And so sesit the suet, soghtyn no ferre. The night was so nigh, noye was the more, The day was done, dymmet the skyes. The Troiens full tite tyrnyt the &yogh;ates, Barret hom bigly with barres of yrne. Achilles with his chiualers chefe to \u00fee bonke, All the grekes agayn Agamynon vnto. The Emperoure hym owne selfe ordant onon, fforto bilde vp tenttes, tariet no lengur. Sithen hym selfe assignet the gret Placis of pauylions, for the prise kynges Grete tenttes to graide, as \u00feaire degre askit; Logges to las men, with leuys of wod. Iche buerne, on his best wise, busket to lenge, ffor the night was so neghe, noyet hom all. Stablit vp hor stedis & hor stithe horses, On suche maner as \u00feai might, for the mene tyme; And all necessaries for \u00fee night, \u00feat \u00feai naite shuld, ffecchit fro the flete, & ferkit to bonke. Thaire shippis in sheltrons shotton to lond, Knyt hom with cables & with kene ancres, And bound hom full bigly on hor best wise. As Agamynon the grete the gomys commaundyt, Brode firis & brem beccyn in \u00fee ost, Torchis and tendlis the tenttes to light, That yche freike in the fild his felow might know, Alse light on to loke, as \u00fee leue day. Other feris opon fer the freikes withoute, With skowte wacche for skathe & skeltyng of harme. The Troiens with tene, \u00feat in the towne were, Neghit hom not negh, ne no noy did, But closit the clene yates, keppit hom within. This Agamynon, the grete, gaynit no slepe. Bis\u00e9 was the buerne all the bare night, To ordan for his Enmyes, as I er saide, ffolke opon fer, the firis withoute, ffor to wacche and to wake for wothis of harme, With qwistlis, & qwes, & other qwaint gere, Melody of mowthe myrthe for to here; And men of armys full mony made for to stond, In soppes on sere halfe the sercle to kepe; The ost out of angur & auntur to were, Wacche wordes to wale, \u00feat weghis might know; Sore men & seke soundly to rest, \u00deat were feblet in fight, & hade fele woundes, To lie in hor lodges a littell at ese. Armet were all men for auntur to come, Till the derke was don, & the day sprange, And the sun in his sercle set vppo lofte.

He auntrid vpon Ector, atlit hym a dynt, With all the forse of his fole & his fuerse arme; He shot \u00ferough the shild & the shene maile, To \u00fee ynmast of his armur, angardly fast; Hit neghit to \u00fee nakid, but no noy did. Ector for \u00feat od dynt, ournyt in hert, Wode for the wap, as a wild lyon; His speire into sprottes sprongyn was before, But he braid out a brond with a bill felle, Carve euyn at the kyng & \u00fee crest hit, Slit hym full slighly to \u00fee slote euyn, \u00deat he dusshet, of \u00fee dynt, dede to \u00fee ground. THE FFOLY DESYRE OF ECTOR. When the kyng was kyld, cast to \u00fee grene, His shene armys to shew shone in the filde. Ector to \u00fee erth egurly light, The gay armur to get of the gode hew, That he duly dessirit in his depe hert; And to spoile that spilt kyng he sped ferr. His horse in his hond held by the reyne, And come to \u00fee kyng, \u00feere the corse lay, Wold haue Robbit the Renke of his riche wede. With the ton hond in the toile tyrnyt it offe: But Merion the mighty with a mayn pepull, With \u00fere thousaund \u00fero men \u00ferong hym vnto. In defence of the freike, \u00feat on fild lay, To Ector in ernyst full angurdly said: \"Nay, warloghe wolfe, in \u00fei wode hongur, \u00deat neuer of forray art full, with \u00fei foule vse, The tydis not to taste of \u00feis triet meite! ffor-bode the firke \u00fei fode forto wyn! Sone shall \u00feou se in a sad hast, A C thousaund on horse highand \u00fee to, Thyn hede forto haue, & hew \u00fee to dethe, And put \u00fee fro purpos, \u00fei payn to encres!\" Sone, by the same kyng & his sad helpis, He was borne fro \u00fee body, backward agayn. His horse for to haue, \u00feai hasted by-dene, And mony strokes, in \u00feat stoure, \u00feo stithe men hym gefe, Till \u00fee knight, vndur knappis, vppon knes fell. Then he stert vp full stithly, with his store might, Was on hys wight horse, for wepyn or other. ffor all the grefe of \u00feo grekes, & \u00fee grete \u00feronge, Was no led might hym let, \u00feof hom lothe were. He meuit taward Merion his malis to venge, Wode of his wit, in his wan yre; But Glaucon the grete, with a grym batell, Theseus, \u00fee tore kyng, turnyt hym agayn, With iij. M. \u00fero men \u00feronge hym aboute, And socurd the same kyng with hor sad helpis. But the first of \u00feo frekes \u00feat he fell to, Was Archilacus, a choise kyng, hym cheuit full ille: The buerne, with his bare sword, bere hym to dethe, \u00deat he felle of his fole flat to \u00fee ground! Mony on he martrid at the meane tyme! The pruddist, \u00feat hym preset, plainly he slogh. Breme was the batell on the bent \u00fean! Mony stithe, in the stoure, stale fro \u00feere lyues. Yet Ector, eftsones, ettillit to assay, And Patroclus proud geere preset to haue. He light doune full lyuely, lettid he noght, And bounet to \u00fee body, \u00feere the buerne lay. \u00deen come \u00feere a kyng with kene men of armys, Idymynus, full dernly, & dressit hym to, With two thowsaund \u00fero knightes, & \u00feronge hym aboute: And Myrion, \u00feat I mynt, with his men all. Thay preset so the prince with power of knightes, \u00deat \u00feai warnit hym his wille, & away put: But fele dynttes he delt, & to dethe cast, And other weghis hym with woundet the grekes. When he segh \u00feat hym-selfe was set vppon fote, And so fele of his fos fuerse hym aboute, All horset but he, & on hegh set, He aforset hym felly with his fyn strenght; Gird to the grekes in his grete yre. Mony woundis he wroght, weghis to dethe; Hondes of hew heturly fast; Mony foteles freike of his fell dinttes; ffele horses with his hond hew he to dethe, Till all shent fro \u00feat shene, & \u00fee shalke leuyt! So he rid hym a rowme in a rad hast, Of \u00feo tulkes, with tene, \u00feat hym take wold. Than Merion, \u00fee mody kyng, \u00feat I mynt first, Presit to Patroclus in place \u00feere he lay, Braid vp the body on his big horse, And so the freike hym before ferkit to his tent. Now the grekes with grem gedrit vnto Ector, His horse for to haue, & hym away lede. Thay caupit at the knight, kene men of armys, \u00deat the wegh on no wise might wyn on his horse. In \u00feat company kene was a knight noble, That Carion was cald by his kynd nome, ffull ernestly with Ector auntrid to fight; Gaf hym dinttes full dedly, & derit hym mekill. But a souerain seruand of \u00fee same prinse Segh his maistur at mischefe amonges his fos; Two speirus full dispitus he sparet to cast, \u00deat fuerse were before & of fell bite. At the knight Carion cast he \u00feat one, As he mellit with his maistur, merkit hym euyn, Hit hym so hitturly with a hard dynt, \u00deat he gird to \u00fee ground, & \u00fee gost yalde. \u00deen ano\u00feer, \u00feat was next, noyet hym alse, Mellit with his maistur at \u00fee mene tyme, The tother speire, \u00feat he sparit, spent vpon hym: Brochit hym \u00ferough \u00fee body \u00feat \u00fee buerne swalt. Then criet he full cantly \u00fee knightes vpon, And the tyde men of Troy, with a tore steuyn, In hast for to hye to \u00feere hed prinse, \u00deat in perell was put in plite to be slayn. \u00deen Synabor, forsothe, with a sad pepull, Neghit to \u00fee note,\u2014his naturall brother; He come to \u00fee crye with a cant will, And gird to the grekes mony grym dynt, ffelled mony fuerse men with his fyne strenght, Made wais full wide, wan to his lord, Halpe hym full hertely, hurt of his fos; Gird hom to ground, & to grym dethe. Thretty of \u00fee \u00feroest he \u00feronge out of lyue: Mony weghis he woundit & warpit to erthe! \u00deen the troiens full tyt tokyn \u00feere hertes, ffell of hor fos with a frike wille, Getyn \u00feere ground with a gret strenght, And frusshet \u00feere fos fer vppo backe. ffuerse Ector was fayn of his fyn helpe, And as wode as a wild bore wan on his horse. He shouuyt \u00feurgh his sheltrum, shent mony grekes, And mard of \u00feo men, out of mynd fele; Gird hom to ground with mony grym hurt. All \u00feat met hym with malis in \u00fee mene tyme, Auther dyet of his dynttes, or were ded wondit. The grekes, for \u00fee greuaunce, gyuen hym \u00fee way, ffled all in fere, ferd of hor dethe. Mony batell he broke, myche bale wroght, All his wedis wex wete of hor wan blode: \u00deen found he no frekes to fraist on his strenght, Ne non so derfe to endure a dynt of his hond. Then Menestaus, \u00fee mighty, with his men hole, The Duke of Athens full derf, drogh into batell, With \u00fere thowsaund \u00fero men, \u00feriuond in armys, And other folke full fuerse, \u00feat the freike hade. He launchit in o \u00fee left side with his ledis all, There Troilus the tried, turnyd to fight With the frigies fell, \u00feat \u00fee freike lad, \u00deat myche greuaunce & grem to \u00fee grekes did; With Alcanus, a kyng, a kid man of strenght, And Machaon, the mighty, with his men all: Xantipus the same batell sothely was \u00feen. There mynget \u00feai \u00feere men, machit hom to-gedur; Mony dedly dint delt hom amonge! Big was the batell vpon bothe haluys, And myche slaghtur in slade, & slyngyng to ground! Troilus, in the toile, turnyt was of hors, ffaght vppon fote felly agayne: Mony woundit the wegh of his wale fos. Menestaus, the mighty, mainly beheld, Segh Troiell in toile, & tynt had his horse, ffoght vppon fote in \u00fee fuerse batell, And myche harme with his hond happit to do. Then aforsit hym the freike with his fuerse knightes, Troilus to take and to tent lede. Presit hym full prudly with his prise folke, Halit hym fro horse fete, & in hond toke. Then he led hym furthe lyuely, and his wille hade. But a mon of \u00feat mighty, \u00feat Myseres was cald, To the frigies in fere felly he saide;\u2014 \"Alas! ledis of \u00feis lond, \u00feat ye lyfe haue! Wherto bounet ye to batell in your bright geire, Whethur worship to wyn, or willfully shame? Se ye not the sun of youre sure kyng, With torfer be takon, & turnyt away? If ye let hym be led furthe, your lefe haue ye tynt, And of sham, \u00feat be shapyn you, shent be ye neuer. Mellis you with monhod & might of your seluyn, To Restore the rynke in a rad hast, Er he be led out of lenght, & lost of your sight, And past fro your pouer thurgh the prese hoge!\" Then Alcanus, the kyng, kyndlit in yre, Gird after the Grekes, with a grete speire, \u00deat Troilus hade takon, hym tenyt full ylle. So he frusshet to a freike, \u00feat the fre led, \u00deat sodenly he seit doun, soght out of lyue; And ano\u00feer, anon, he nolpit to ground, Shent of \u00feo shalkes, shudrit hom Itwyn. So fuersly he fore, and freikes \u00feat hym halpe, \u00deat Troilus was takyn, & turnyt furth louse, And don out of daunger for the due tyme. The freke \u00feen in fuerse hast ferkid on horse, Grippit to a grym sword, gird on his fos, ffor to comford the kyng, \u00feat hym caght hade. \u00deis Xantipus soght forth with a sad dynt To Mynestaus with might, & \u00fee mon hit, That \u00fee freike hade ben fay but for his fyn armur. Then Menestaus mournyt, & mykell sorow hade, That Troilus, \u00fee triet, was takyn of his hond, And afforsit hys frekys to \u00fee fight harde: He gedrit all hys gomys in a grete hate. \u00dee fyght was fel \u00feo frekis betwene; Mony derf, to \u00fee deth, vndur dyntes yode; Mony buerne on the bent bytturly wondyt; Mony knyghtys were kyld to \u00fee cold deth! Ector was euermore Eger with-all; Mony weghys in hys wrath welt to \u00fee ground; Mony Slogh in \u00fee slade \u00feurgh sleght of hys hond; And sore greuyt \u00fee Grekys with his grete dyntys. Menestaus \u00fee mighty, \u00feat mekill was in yre, ffor he faylit of \u00fee freke, \u00feat he first toke, As he rod \u00feurgh \u00fee rout with his roid fare, \u00dee troiens to tene with his tore strenkyth, He met with \u00feis Myseres at \u00fee mene tyme, By qwom he lost \u00fee lord, \u00feat he laght hade. He knew hym full lyuely by colore of his armys, And frunt euyn to \u00fee freke with a fell spere, Hurlet hym to hard vrthe vndur horse fete; But \u00fee lede vppon lyue leuyt he \u00feen, And nolpit to another, \u00feat hym noiet at, Gird hym vne to \u00fee ground in hys gret yre. \u00deen Hupon, \u00fee hoge kyng, highet to batell. With mony tulkys of troy, tryet in were; And Eripa also auntrid hym with, With all \u00fee ledys of Larris led hom betwene. And fro \u00fee grekys com gyrdond agaynes \u00feo two, Prothenor, a prise kyng, & pert Archelaus, With all \u00fee buernes of Boyes, bold men of hond. \u00deen \u00fee fyght wex fell, & mony freke deghyt! Sone after, forsothe, o \u00fee Cit\u00e9 halue, Polidamas aprochit with a proud ost,\u2014 Antenor aune son abill of dedys. He segh \u00fee troiens so tore, & turnyt so \u00feik, All pyght in a place on a playn feld. Anon to anothir side naitli he dryuys, With all \u00fee here, \u00feat he hade, highit aboute, And fell to \u00fee fyght with his folke hole. \u00deen yssit furth also, yrfull in dedys, Remys, \u00fee Ryche kyng, with a rught batell, And presit in prudly with a proud wyll, And fell to \u00fee fyght with \u00fee freke alse. \u00deere was kyllyng of knyghtis, crusshyng of helmys, Bold men bakward borne of hor horses: \u00deat assembly was sorer of \u00feo sad knyghtis. Mony hurlit doun hedstoupis to \u00fee hard vrthe! Polidamus, \u00fee pert, presit vnto Merion, \u00deat was auntrus in armys, Elan aune cosyn;\u2014 He was a duke in hys day, & for dere holdyn, A &yogh;op knyght & a &yogh;onge, of &yogh;eris but lite;\u2014 So he gird to \u00feat greke with a grym spere, \u00deat he seyt to \u00fee soile, & soght out of lyue. When Menelay, \u00fee myghty, \u00feat myschef beheld, Myche sorow for \u00fee syght sank in his hert; He turnyt to \u00fee troiens his tene for to venge, With all \u00fee bir in hys brest, for hys bale angur. He raght vnto Remys with a roid dynt, Alto hurlit his helme, harmyt hym euyll, Wondyt hym wykkydly, walt hym to ground. Half ded of \u00fee dynt, \u00feer \u00fee duk lay!

With myche wepyng & wo, weghis of his aune Luggit hym out to \u00fee laund, lefte hym for ded; And fore agayne to \u00fee fyght \u00feaire feris to help. THE DETHE OF CELIDIS THE KYNG BY POLIDAMUS. Kyng Celidis, forsothe, semliest of knightes, All folke in \u00feat filde, of fairhed he past, Of whom Daries, in his dytyng, duly me tellus All the shap of \u00feat shene, in his shire boke: The qwene of femyn\u00e9 \u00feat freike so faithfully louyt, More he sat in hir soule \u00feen hir-selfe ay. This Celidis, forsothe, fought with a speire, Polidamas to put doun, & his pride felle; And he, wode of his wit for \u00fee wale dynt, Corve euyn at the kyng with a kene sword, Hurlit \u00feurghe the helme & the hed bothe, That he braid ouer backward & on bent light. Honerable Ector, euer vppon-one ffell of \u00feo fuerse men, & \u00feurgh the fild rode: Mony batels he broke, buernes he slough, And made wayes full wide \u00feurgh the wale ost. \u00deen he soght to a syde, \u00feere salam\u00e9 folke Were fightyng full fell with the fuerse troiens, With Thessall the tried kyng, & hor true hede, That was lord of \u00fee lond, & the ledes aght. This Thessall, in the toile myche tene wroght, Tyrnit doun Troiens with mony toure dynttes: Mony woundit the wegh, & warpit to ground, Myche dere he hom did with dynttes of hond. \u00deen Teuser, with tene turnyt to Ector, Sparrit to hym with a speire spitusly fast; Woundit hym full wickedly in his wild yre; Hurt hym full hidiously, hastid away. Ector richit his reyne, the Renke for to mete, ffor to wreike of his wound, & the wegh harme; But the freike for ferd fled of his gate, ffrusshet \u00feurgh the folke forth of his sight. Then for wrath of his wound, & for wild shame, He gird to a greke, \u00feat was a grym syre, With a swyng of his sword swappit hym of lyue, And mony other martrid at the mene tyme. A gret nowmber of grekes gedrit hym vmbe, Hym tyte for to take, or tyrne vnto dethe. Among all the meny was mighty Teseus, \u00deat onestly to Ector \u00feus esely said:\u2014 \"Sir, buske fro the batell er you bale worthe, Lest you happyn with hond here to be slayne: Of soche a mon were a mysse \u00feurgh the mekyll world.\" Ector full onestly \u00feat onerable \u00feanket: And yet the batell on bent was breme to behold! The Troiens with tene turnyt to the grekes. Polidamas, with prise, prestly can fight, With his Enmeis full egurly, euer vpon-one. Menelay the mighty, in the mene tyme, And Telamon, the tore kyng, tally to-gedur: To Polidamas \u00feai preset all in pure angur, The freike for to felle, & ferke out of lyue. Telamon hym tacchit on with a tore speire, Bare hym downe backward with a bir hoge, Preset hym with payne, & with proude strokes, Tokyn hym full tyte, \u00feof hym tene thoght. Brokon was the blade of his big sword, His helme of hurlit, & his hed bare. \u00deai led hym furth lightly, \u00feof hym loth thught, To the tentes full tomly, \u00feaire entent was. But Ector, as aunter fell, euyn was beside, Segh the grekes with \u00feat gome gedrit full \u00feicke; The prise knight put doun the pepull among, Takon with torfer, hym tenyt full euyll. He hurlet forth vnhyndly, harmyt full mony, Of \u00fee ledis, \u00feat hym led, luskit to ground; Made waies full wide, wan to the knight, And xxx in the throng thrucchit to dethe; The remnond full radly rid hym the gate, fflagh all in fere, and the freike leuyt. He highit of \u00feere hondes, and his horse toke, Wan on hym wightly, & of woche past. The kyng Bisshop the bold, byg Menelaus, And Thelamon the tore kyng, with theire tite batels, All assemblit on a sop in a sad hast, And fell to the frigies in a fuerse wille. \u00deai foghton so felly with the freikes \u00feen, Derit hom with dynttes, delt mony woundes, Hurlet hom on hepis, hurt of hor knightes, fferket hom to flight fuersly by-dene. All-\u00feof Ector was on, \u00feat odmony slogh, And wonderfully wroght with wepyn at the tyme, Hym-selfe might not suffise to \u00feat soume hoge. His horse, in \u00feat hete, was hurlit to dethe, And he foght vpon fote with \u00feo felle grekes, Wore hym full wightly, & myche wo did: Was non so bold in \u00feat batell, of \u00feo buernes all, fforto deire hym with dynt, ne \u00fee Duke touche, Ne negh hym with noy, for nolpis of his hond. His nobill brether naturile nemly persayuit, \u00deat \u00fee troiens in the toile had turnyt \u00fee backe, And segh not \u00feere souerain, \u00feaire sorow was \u00fee more, Wend \u00feere lord hade ben lost, or of lyue broght. \u00deai assemblit on a sop sone vpon-one, ffrusshet to \u00fee fight, \u00fee freike for to laite. ffull bremly \u00feurgh the batels \u00fee buernes can pas, And wan to \u00feat worthy, \u00feat in woche stode; Telamon, the tore kyng, \u00feai tenfully woundit, Gird mony to \u00fee ground of the grekes felle. Dynadron, a derf knight of his dere brother, Preset to Polexuma, \u00feat hade a proude stede, Gird hym euyn to \u00fee ground, grippit his horse, Raght to \u00fee Reynes, ricchit hom belyue, Broght hym his brother, \u00fee best vpon erthe, And he launchit o lofte with a light wille. All the nobill anon,\u2014\u00feo naturill brether,\u2014 Wonderfully wroght with wepyn in hond, Gird doun of the grekes vnto grym dethe, And stird hom in the stoure stightly vnfaire. Then Deffibus drogh negh with a derfe pepull, \u00deat by ordynaunse of Ector was etlit to hym; The prise folke of Poyeme presit hym after, Bowmen of \u00fee best, big in hor armys, Myche greuaunce & grem to \u00fee grekes did. Mony woundit \u00feo weghis & warpit to ground, Mony shalke \u00feurgh shot with \u00feere sharpe gere, And myche hyndrit the hepe with \u00feere hard shot. Deffibus the doughty, with a derfe wepyn, Tachit vpon Teutro, a full tore dynt, Vne fourme in the face foule to behold. \u00deen the troiens, full tite, tokyn \u00feere hertes ffelly vnto fight, \u00feat were fled er. ffull stithe was \u00fee stoure for \u00fee striffe new; Mony bold on the bent brytont to dethe; Mony lyue of lept with lasshyng of swerdis! As Theseus, the tore duke, the troiens anoyet, And mony fell of \u00fee folke, with his fuerse wepon, On of Ector owne brether, \u00feat I erst neuenyt, And Modernus, the mayn kyng, on \u00fee mon set. Theseus \u00feai toke, \u00feof hym tene \u00feoght, And wold haue slayn hym in \u00fee slade sleghly anon; But Ector aurthwart \u00feis auntrid to se, Bade hom leue of lightly, let hym pas forth, Withouten hurt ow\u00feer harme, hast hym agayn: And so he kyd hym counsell of kyndnes before. At biddyng of \u00fee bold, \u00fee buerne was rescewet, He launchit furth lightly, & \u00fee lede \u00feonket, Gird furth to \u00fee grekes with a glad chere, And Ector euer more egerly \u00feonket. Then \u00fee kyng of Calsidon com into batell, Toax, a tide mon of \u00feat o\u00feer side, And Philote, a fuerse kyng, with a fell power, A grete nowmber of grekes with a grym fare. Toax, in his tene, with a tore speire, Caupit to Cassibilan, \u00fee kynges son of Troy,\u2014 On of Ector aun brether, \u00feat I er said; And \u00fee lede on lokond, hym launchit to dethe: ffor whose dethe the Duke moche dole \u00feolit. As wode in his wit as a wild bore, Gird euyn to the grekes in his gret yre, And mony knight doun kyld in his kene hate. Sum wondit full wide, walt to \u00fee ground; Sum hurlit to \u00fee hard yerth, & on hede light; Sum \u00fee lymes of lop, sum \u00fee lyf tynt; And myche wo in his wodenes wroght at \u00fee tyme. So fuersly he fore in his fight \u00feen, With other helpe \u00feat he hade, his harmys to venge, \u00deat \u00fee grekes gyuen bake, & the ground leuyn, And were forsit to \u00fee fight or \u00feai fay worthit. \u00deen gird in on \u00fee grekes half with a grym fare, Nestor, the noble duke, with a new batell Of v thousaund fuerse men, & felle to \u00fee stour, \u00deat mony warchand wound wroght on hor fos. ffull tyte fro \u00fee toun turnyt hym agayne, Philon, a felle kyng, & his fere Esdras, \u00deat shot \u00feurgh \u00feere sheltruns & shent mony knightes.

Then came on the King of Perse with fiue thousand knights, that Paris lead; and so did all the other Troyans, and made the Greeks recule, and goe back by force. Dares writeth in his Boke, how that Hector slew a thousand knights, onely in this assault. Among all other things, Hector encountred the King Menon before a Tent, and said to him: \"ha, euill traitour, that thou lettest me to take the armes of Patroclus:\" and then he smote him so great a stroke that he fell downe to the ground. And after Hector alighted downe, and smote off his head, and would haue taken his armes from him: but Menesteus letted him, and smote upon Hector ouerthwart, by such force that he gaue him a great wound, and went then his way without more tarrying, doubting the fury of Hector. Then Hector went out of the throng and bound up his wound, that it bled no more; and after went in againe into the prease, and slew in his comming many Greekes. And Dares sayth, that after he had bound up his wound, he slew the same day a thousand Knights, and there was none had courage to auenge him \n  against him, or defend himselfe, but he put them all to flight; and the Troyans entred into their Tents, and pilled and robbed them, and tooke all the best that they could finde.] Guido di Colonna: (from The Ancient Historie of The Destruction of Troy .

Then auntrid \u00feat Ector aurthwert beheld The stroke of \u00fee stith; with a strenght arme He keppit the caupe on his clene sheld, And britnet the bold with a breme dynt: The right arme, with a rappe, reft fro \u00fee shul|durs; Hurlit hym to hard erthe, hue hym to dethe.

There it felle hom by fortune a ferfull cas! As \u00feis mysshapon mon marrit of \u00fee grekes, The Troiens in the tenttes tenyt hom also, Oppressit hom with payne & with pale strokes. Diamede, the derfe kyng, \u00feat don was to flight, Presit to a pauilyon the pepull before, Wold haue wonen away & of woche p st, And haue sauet hym selfe, & he so might. There met hym \u00feis Mawhown, \u00feat was so mysshap, Euyn forne in his face, as he fle wold. He myght no wise away for wothe of his dethe, But auther aunter vppon hym, or angardly moue. He se his fomen so felle and fuerse at his backe, \u00deat wold lelly the lede out of lyue bryng; And if he turnyt hade tyte, \u00feen hym tyde shuld, The warlagh with a wicked arowe woundit hym behynd. He auntrid on this Vnbest angardly fast. As the shalke shuld haue shot at the shene kyng, Dyamede with a dynt dang hym to ground, With a swap of his swerd he swalt in the place. Then the grekes with grym there gedurt \u00feere hertes, ffrusshet out felly, and the ffild toke; Bore backward the batell of \u00fee bold troiens; Kyld of hor knightes and kene men of armys! Ector to Achilles angardly rode; And he keppit hym full kenely, \u00feai caupit togedur, That bothe were backward \u00feere borne of \u00feere horses, And light on the lond the lordes in fere. But Achilles aftir auntrid to rise, Highet to his horse in a hote yre, Grypit vnto galathe, \u00feat was the gode stede Of honerable Ector, & etlit away.

This Calcas to the kyngis contynually prayet, Bothe Agamynon the grete, & the grekes all, That \u00feai Priam shuld pray for this prise lady, To be sent to hir Sir, if he so lyked; And \u00feai the bysshoppis bone bainly haue graunted, And sent to \u00feat souerain for \u00fee same cause, Dessirond full depely delyuerans of hir, With Speciall speche to spede at the tyme. But the triet men of Troy traitur hym cald, And mony pointtes on hym put for his pure shame, \u00deat disseruet full duly \u00fee dethe for to haue. Priam, at the prayer of \u00feo prise kynges, Deliuert the lady with a light wille, In eschaunge of \u00feo choise, \u00feat chaped before,\u2014 Toax \u00feat I told and \u00feat tothir duke.

Achilles, the choise kyng, with a chere faire, Welcomyt \u00feat worthy, as a whe noble! He hade solas of \u00fee sight sothely of hym, ffor his body was bare out of bright wedes. He toke hym to his tent, talket with hym fast; ffraynet at the freike of his fell dedis: And as \u00feai spekon of \u00feere spede in hor spell \u00feere, Thies wordes to \u00feat worthy warpit Achilles:\u2014 THE WORDES BETWENE ACHILLES AND ECTOR IN THE TENTE. \"Now Ector, in ernyst, I am euyn fayn Of \u00fee sight of \u00fei Self, to se \u00fee vnarmyt; Syn \u00feat fortune before fell me neuer ere, To se \u00fei body all bare out of bright wedis.

He approchet to \u00fee prinse, presit hym ner, And affyrmit with faithe & with fyn chere, All \u00feo couenaundes to kepe with his cleane trauthe: This he sadly assurit at the same tyme.

THE SOROW OF TROILUS FOR BREISAID HIS LOUE. When hit tolde was Troilus the tale of his loue, How \u00feat faire, by his ffader, was fourmet to wende To the grekes, by graunt of \u00feo grete kynges, ffor Bresaide the bright vnblithe was his chere; ffor he louit hir full lelly, no lesse \u00feen hym seluyn, With all the faithe and affection of hys fyn hert. Myche sykyng and sorow sanke in his brest; He was tourment with tene, tynt was his hew; All wan was the weghe for his wete teres; With lamentacion & langour vnlusty to se; Was no knight in the court kouthe comford hym oght, Ne ses hym of sorow sothely \u00feat tyme! And Bresaid, the bright, blackonet of hew; With myche weping & waile, waterid hir ene; All fadit that faire of hir fyn coloure, With shedyng of shire water of hir shene chekes; All-to tugget hir tresses of hir triet here; Hir faire fyngurs with forse femyt of blode, And all-to rafet the rede chekys, ruthe to be holde, That the blode out brast, & on brest light; And ay swonit in swyme, as ho swelt wold In \u00feere hondes, \u00feat hir helde & halp hir to stond; And \u00fees wordes ho warpit as hir wo leuit:\u2014 \"I hade leuer my lyf leue in this place, Than any lengur to lyffe & my luff tyne!\" No lengur of thies louers list me to carpe, Ne of the feynit fate of \u00feat faire lady; Who-so wilnes to wit of \u00feaire wo fir, Turne hym to Troilus, & talke \u00feere ynoghe! Hit is a propertie apreuit, & put hom of kynd. To all wemen in the world, as \u00fee writ saythe, To be vnstable & not stidfast, styrond of wille: ffor yf the ton ee with teres trickell on hir chekes, The tothur lurkes in lychernes, & laghes ouer|thwert! So full are \u00feo faire fild of dessait, And men for to mad is most \u00feere dessyre, There is no hope so vnhappy, \u00feat hastes to noght, Ne so vnsikur at a say, as to set vppon wemen! A foole is \u00feat freike in his frele yowthe, And myche more \u00feat man is meuyt into age, That in wordes of wemen wastyn \u00feere hope, Or in faire hotes of \u00feo fre fully will trust. This Breisaid, the burde, by byddyng of \u00fee kyng, In apparell full prowde purpost to wend; Troilus, the true knight, with triet men other, ffro the Cit\u00e9 with \u00feat semely soghtyn on \u00fee gate. Then the grekes com girdond fro the gay tentes, Resayuit hir with Reuerense, & Riden furthe somyn; And the Troiens to the towne turnyt agayne. The derf kyng Diamede drughe the lady ner, Beheld hur full hertely, het hir in loue; With venus woundit, I-wis, in his wild hert, He rode to \u00feat Riall, and the Reyne toke. Then he said to \u00feat semly all on soft wise, All his corage by corse of his cold hert, With full speciall speche to spede of his erend. Then Breisaid, the bright, bainly onswart, ffor to hold hym in hope & hert hym the bettur:\u2014 \"Nauther list me my luff lelly the graunt, Ne I refuse the not fully \u00fei frendship to voide; ffor my hert is not here holly disposit, To onsware on otherwise, ne ordant \u00feerfore!\" At hir wordes, I-wis, the worthy was glad; Hengit in hope, held hym full gayne. At hir fader fre tent fongit hir in armys, And set hir on \u00fee soile softely with hond. A gloue of \u00feat gay gate he belyue, Drogh hit full dernly the damsell fro: None seond but hir-selfe, \u00feat suffert full well. Hit pleaside hir priuely, playntyde ho noght, Let hit slip from hyr slyly, slymyt \u00feerat. Than Calcas, the clerke, came fro his tent, ffongit hir faire and with fyne chere, Toke hir into tent, talket with hir fast, And menit of hir maters, as \u00feai in mynd hade.

The secund day suyng, says me \u00fee lyne, There bownet vnto batell from the burgh euyn, Mony triet men of Troy, and tokyn \u00fee fild, Euyn ordant by Ector, after his deuise. The prinse with his pouer past on first, With xv .M. fully, all of fyn knightes, In his batell full bold boun to \u00fee feld: And Troiell with x .M. turnit forth aftur. Then Paris put furth, the percians hym with,\u2014 Abill men of archery, auntrus in wer,\u2014 Three M. thro and thristy of hond, Vppon horses full hoge, hardy men all. Then Deffibus drogh furth, & to \u00fee dede went, With thre M. thro men, \u00ferepond in armys. Eneas afturward with angardly mony, And o\u00feer kynges full kant, as \u00feere course fell.

Then meuit with as mony, mighty Dyomydes, And Achilles with choise men chosen of the same. Than sought furth Xantippus with sad men a hepe, Thre thowsaund thristy, \u00ferong to the fild. Than Agamynon the grete gird on the last, With a noyus nowmbur, nait men of strenght. The first, \u00feat to fight past, was Philoc the kyng, Put hym furth prudly, presit to \u00fee Troiens! Ector met hym with mayn, macchit hym so harde, That he gird to the ground & the gost past. Myche clamur & crye for the kynges sake, And dynttes full dedly delt hom betwene. Then girde o the greke halfe with grym fare, Xantipus, a sure Kyng, with a sad wepyn, ffor to dere for \u00fee dethe of his dere vncle. He suet furth sadly to \u00fee sure prinse, And stroke hym full stithly with a stiff sworde. Ector turnet with tene, toke hym on \u00fee hed, \u00deat he slode doun sleghly, & sleppit euer after. Then the grekes were greuit for the grym kyng; Oppressit hom with pyne, pressit full hard; Turnit to the Troiens, tenit hom full euill; Mony woundit full wickedly, & warpit of horse. Achilles mony choise men choppit to \u00fee erthe; Mony ledes with his launse out of lyfe broght. Two Dukes full derne vnto dethe kyld, \u00deat were comyn to \u00fee kyng with \u00feere kyde helpis,\u2014 ffull bold men in batell, & myche bale did.

But the knight, in his kene yre, cast vp his egh, Brusshet on the burgh & the bright walles, Segh the ladies o lofte leghen to waite,\u2014 Elan an other, the oddest of Troy, His worshipful wife, \u00feat he well louet, With his Suster beside, the semliest on lyue, \u00deat were sory for \u00fee sight, Semple of chere. And the grekes so grymly had gird hom abacke \u00deat euyn borne were \u00feai bigly to the bare wallis Than shamet was the shalke for the shene ladies, And euyn wode of his wit wex he belyue. THE DETHE OF MYRION BY ECTOR SLAYN. He kyld \u00feere a kyng, cosyn to Achilles,\u2014 On Merion the myghty,\u2014thurgh the mayn dynt. He hurlet thurgh the helme, \u00feat the hed yemed, \u00deat the brayn all-to brast, & on bent leuyt. Achilles aurthwart this aunterd to se, Grippet to a grete speire with a grym wille; Pight on the prinse, persit his wede; Mart of his mailes, meuit hym noght; And nauther hurt he the hathell, ne hade hym to ground. \u00deen Ector in angur, angardly fast, With the bit of his brond, on the bold light; Hurlit \u00feurgh the helme & the hard maile. But it breke not the brayn, ne the buerne woundit. Achilles, with a chop, cheuyt on syde; All in wer for to walt, wayueronde he sote, But he held hym on horse, houyt o lofte. Euyll masit of the mynt, & the mayn stroke, Thes wordys to the whe warpit the prinse:\u2014 \"Achilles, Achilles, \u00feou cheses \u00fee fast, ffor to prese me with pyne in thy proud yre! The next tym \u00feou noyes me, \u00feou neghis to \u00fee fer, Thow dowtles shall dye with dynt of my hond.\" But or hit auntrid hym to aunsware Ector agayne, Come Troilus full tyte with a tore pepull, ffrushet in felly \u00feo frekes betwene, Depertid the prinse & the prise kyng. So he greuit the Grekes, and gird hom abacke, \u00deat fyue houndrith were fay & in fild leuyt, Off knightes full kene, kild in the stoure; And o backe fro the burghe bere hom anon. Menelay with his men meuyt in swithe, Thre thousaund full \u00fero \u00ferang into batell; Restorit hom stithly, stuffit hom anon, And cobbyt full kantly, kaghten the fild. Then Sedymon with a sowme from the Cit\u00e9 come, Of fell men in fight, freikes of his owne: He macchit hym to Menelay, & met on \u00fee kyng, Woundit hym wickedly in his wale face, And gird hym to ground of his grete horse. Than Troiell hym toke \u00feurgh his tried helpe Of Sedymon, the same kyng \u00feat \u00fee syre felle, Wold haue led the lord o-lyue to \u00fee towne; But the stoure was so stithe, & stedis so thicke, Thai pullid hym with pyne, but passid \u00feai noght. Then Diamede full dernly, with a dyn hoge, On Troiell with tene tachet belyue; Bere hym backe to the bent of his big stede, Raght to the Reynes in a rad hast, Sent hym by a seruaund, or he ses wold, To Breisaide the bright, & bad hym to say, That \u00feat was lelly a ledis, \u00feat ho louet well,\u2014 The whiche fro Troiell he toke, & turnet hym besyde, With a stroke, in the stoure, of his stithe arme.\u2014 Prayaund her prestly, with all his pure hert, \u00deat hir seruaund were sadly set in hir mynd, Dyamed, the derf kyng, in daunger of loue. \u00deen the seruond, full sone, with the same horse, Went to the woman fro the wale kyng, And the palfray of prise present hir to. Ho receyuit hym with Reuerence, & to \u00fee Renke said:\u2014 \"To \u00fei lord, \u00feat me loues, lelly \u00feou telle, I may not hate hym, by heuyn, \u00feat me in hert tes.\" ffro the maidon, with his message he meuyt anon, And the bodeword broght to \u00fee bold kyng. ffayne was the freike of the fre answare, Past furth into prese, paynet hym ther-for. The grekes \u00fean were gird backe to \u00feere grete tenttes; With Swym vnder swerd swalton full mony! Ne hade Agamynon the gret oste gird in anon, The fight in the fild hade ben fynisshed for euer. Than Restoret was the stithe batell stuernly agayn! The grekes full grymly girdon out swithe, Harmet hom hogely in a hond while. Polidamas, the pert knight, presit in \u00feen, With a batell full breme, britnet the grekes; ffaght with hom felly, frunt hom abacke; Droff hom vnto dykes with dynttes of sword. Then Diamede the doughty duly beheld, Segh \u00fee freke in his felnes his folk so distroy. He ffrusshit at hym felly with a fyn spere; And the knight hym kept, caupit with hym so, That bothe the hathell and his horse hurlit to ground. Dyamed was derit with a depe hurt, Euill frusshet with the fall, & on feld lay. Polidamas the prise horse presit vnto, Raght to \u00fee Reyne, and the Roile toke; Broght hym full bainly to \u00fee bold Troiell, \u00deat was fightand on fote in \u00fee felle stoure. The triet knight Troiell titly wan vp, As fayne of the foale, as a freke might. Then Achilles with angur angardly preset, Troiell to tene with a triet wepyn; And he keppit the kyng with a kant wille, Hurlit hym to hard yerthe, hurt hym full sore. The bold kyng vp braid, & the bent leuyt, ffor deire of his dynt dut hym but litle! \u00deen Ector come auerthwert, as aunter befell, Presit hym to \u00fee place with a prise sworde; Brittonit the bold men, \u00feat aboute stode, And mony dange to the dethe & deret full mekyll! HERE ECTOR KYLDE A THOWSAUND. Thus Dares of his dedis duly vs tellus, A thowsaund, full throly, he \u00ferang to \u00fee dethe,\u2014 All the knightes full kant, \u00feat keppit Achilles,\u2014 To haue wonen to \u00feat worthy, so wodely he fore! There Achilles with choppes chaunset so hard, With myche wo he hym werit in wothe of his lyffe. Then the night come anon, neghit with merke, And for lacke of the light the ledis depertid: ffro the batell on bothe halues busket anon And turnyt to towne & to tenttes all. Than thretty dayes \u00feroly \u00feei \u00ferappit in feld, And mony bold in the bekur were on bent leuit! Mony doughty were ded of the derfe Troiens, But mo were \u00feere marrit of \u00fee mayne grekes.

Hit was festenit with faithe, & with fyn othes, On bothe halues to hold holly assentid, Withouten fight or affray to the fer end. Er \u00fees dayes were done, the doughty prinse Ector Was hole of his hurtes \u00feurgh helpe of a leche. In a halle, \u00feat was hoge, \u00feere \u00fee hend lay, In honerable Ylion, eset hym a qwile, Of whiche fairehed & fourme, the fynest clerke Dares Tellys in his trety, vppon trew wise. Hit was pight vp with pilers all of pure stones, Palit full prudly; and a proude flore Rowchet all with cristall, clere as the sonne. The walles vp wroght on a wise faire With stones full stoute, stithest of vertue. ffaire pillers were \u00feere proude, all of pure coper, In ffoure hyernes of the house hogely fest. O lofte on tho louely were loget to stond, ffoure ymages full fresshe, all of fyn gold, Wonderfully wroght weghis to be-hold, With gematry Justly aioynet to gedur; Miche soteltie, for-sothe, settyng of notes, Crafte \u00feat was coynt, knawyng of tymes, And other faynet fare & fantasy olde! Within the tyme of the tru, the triet kyng Priam, His noble sonnes naturell naitly gert bery, With hor brether, in the burgh, on his best wise: Eure son by hym selfe, sais me the lyne, In a precius place, & in prise toumbis! HERE \u00deAI FFAGHT TWELUE DAYES TO-GEDUR. When the sex monethes were meuit of \u00fee mene true, Than faght \u00feai in feld felly to gedur, Twelue dayes, be-dene, dole to be-holde! ffull myche was the murthe of \u00feo mayn knightes, On bothe sydes, for-sothe, sayes me the lyne; And myche blode on the bent of tho bold leuyt.

Therto sworne were \u00feai swiftly on hor swete haloes, And affermyt hit fast: and here a ffyt endes.", "22": "The xxj Boke. Of the biij Batell: And of the Dreme of Ector wyffe. Lengye here at a litill, lystyn my wordes, I shall tell you full tyte how hom tyde after, When thes dayes were done, & dryven to an ende, All \u00feai fforen to \u00fee fight, & the fild toke! Of Andromaca drem I dresse me to telle, How hir noyet in the night, er \u00feai to note yode. As \u00feis burde was in bed with hir blythe lorde, And slippit vpon slepe, slomeryng a while, Sho was affrayet full foule with a fuerse dreme, That she met of hir maister, & masit full euyll. At hir wakonyng ho wist, as the writ sayes, Iff the bold vnto batell busket \u00feat day, He shuld doutles be dede, & drepit for euer! Andromaca for drede of her dreme felle, Miche water ho weppit, and wackont the prince. As \u00feai bothe were in bed, \u00fee burd to hym saide, And told hym by tale, as her tyde hade. Sho prayet the prinse with hir pure hert, ffor drede of hir drem, & deire \u00feat might falle, On nowise in thys world the walles to passe, ffor to bowne vnto batell, ne of burghe wend. \u00dean the worthy at his wife wrathet a litle, And blamyt the burde for hir bold speche. Hit was vnsittyng, he said, a sad man of wit, Any dremys to drede, or deme hom for trew, Syn \u00feai feble are & faint, & falsly dissayuyn, And be-lirten yche lede, \u00feat leuys \u00feerapon. When the day vp droghe, & the derke voidet, The burd bownet fro bed, & of boure past: To his fader ho fore, & his fre moder. All ho told hom in tale, as her tyde hade, Besechis the souerain, with sykyng in hert, Hir lord for to let, for lure \u00feat might happyn: On nowise \u00feat he went, for wothe of his lyf! When the sun vp set with his softe beames, All the batels of the burghe bownet to feld, Ordant of Ector efter his deuyse. Troiell, the triet knyght, toke the feld sone; Then Paris full prest put hym next aftur. Deffebus drogh furth with a derfe pepull; Eneas afturward auntred to feld. Polidamas, the proud knight, past on swithe; Then the fuerse kyng Forcius folowet anon; And Philmen, the freke, with a felle batell. Then all the kynges by course, \u00feat comyn were to Troy, The citie to socour, with \u00feere sute hoole, Passit furth fro Priam to \u00fee playn feld, With leue of \u00fee lord, \u00feat the lond aght. Then Priam to \u00fee prinse prestly can send, That he bownet to no batell, ne \u00fee burgh past, On nowise in this world, for worship or other. Therat Ector was angry, & angardly wrothe, Repreuet the prinses with a pale face: With his worshipful wife wrathit hym \u00feen. Withouten leue of the lord, \u00feat hym let wold, To his seruondes he saide in a sad haste, To bryng hym his bright geire, bownet to fild, And arayed for the rode with a ronke wille. Than his wif was war of his wille sone, Myche watur ho weppit, wailyng for sorow. Two sonnes hade \u00feat semly, with the sure prinse,\u2014 On Lamydon was litle, and his leue brother Astionac also, \u00feat after was borne,\u2014 \u00deat were bothe at the brest of the bright norse, Noght put fro the pappe to no prise fode. The ton toke ho full tyte in hir true armys, To the fote of \u00feat fre fell ho belyue: Hit was dole & deire, \u00feat dere to be-hold! With myche wepyng & woo \u00fees wordes ho said:\u2014 \"A! my lord, & it like yow at this lefe tyme, I be-seche you, for my sake sober youre wille: Put of youre purpos, preses no fer, ffor all the loue in our lyue, \u00feat light vs betwene!\" He denyet hir anon: hir noy was the more. And sho braid with the barne to \u00fee bare erthe, Vmbfoldyt his fete, felle vnto swone. And when ho wacknet of wo, thies wordes ho said:\u2014 \"If ye no mercy haue on me, for mysse \u00feat I thole, Haue pit\u00e9 on youre pure sonnes, \u00feat mone payne thole! To be done to \u00fee dethe with hor dere moder, Or be shot out with shame fro youre shene landes; Exiled for euermore endles to sorow, Pight vnder pouert and penaunce to lyue!\" Then his moder the myld qwene, & his meke syster, Cassandra the clene, & clere Polexena, And honerable Elan also, with hom: Thies fellyn hym to fete with a foule chere, Prayond the prinse (pitie was to se) To put of his pale wedis, & his pale entre; And abyde in the burgh to the bare night. He hade no ruthe of hor remyng, ne \u00fee rank teris, Ne \u00fee prayer of \u00feo prise persit not his hert; But past furth prudly his purpos to hold, And bounet toward batell, bode he no lengur. \u00deen Andromoca for dol drogh out of wit, Vne fore as a fole, fonnet at all; Past vnto Priam, \u00fee prinsis aune fadur, With a rufull rore rent of hir clothis; Rafit \u00fee red chekis roidly with hond, And \u00fee hore of hir hede heterly pullit! So \u00feat ffre with hir face fore at \u00fee tyme, \u00deat all blod was \u00fee bright in hir ble qwit: Ho was vnkyndly to knaw of hir kyd frendis. So disfigurt of face & febill of hew, To \u00fee fete of \u00fee fre kyng fel ho belyue, Besechond \u00feat soueran, in a sad hast ffor to high to \u00feat hynd, & hold hym within, \u00deat he fore not to fight, ne the fild toke! Than Priam in pure hast preset to horse, Lept vp full lyghtly, & the lede folowet: Ouertoke hym full tyte, taried hym \u00fean, Raght to the reynes of his riche bridell: Vne wrothe in his wille weppit full sore, Comaundand \u00feat comly, as his kynd fader, By all hor goddes so gret, & greuyng of hym, \u00deat he fare shuld ne ferre, ne the feld entre. At the last, \u00feurgh the likyng of his lege kyng, And offence of his ffader, the freke agayne turnyt: Past euyn to his palais, & the place entrid. He wold put of no plate of his prise armur, But abode in the burgh in his bright wedis. Then the batell was brem in the brode felde, Mony fell in the fight at the first tyme! Dyamede that duke, & the derfe Troilus, Evyn macchit hom to mete with two mayn speires: With all the bir in hor brest and hor byg horses, So \u00feai cast hom to caupe with a course felle, The ton hade doutles ben dede, & drepit for ay, Hade not Menelay mightyly met hom betwene, With a batell full big bere hom in sonder. He frunt to a fuerse kyng of frigies lond, A mon full of might, \u00feat Meseron was cald: He had hym of horse, hyndward anon, And he was takon full [tite] & turnyt away. Polidamas, the prise knight, come prikond belyue With a folke \u00feat was felle, & the fight entrid. He Reskewet the Renke, russhet vnfaire, And myche baret on bent to the buernes dyd: \u00dean the grekes agayne grippit the kyng, Wold haue [had] of his hede in a hast \u00feere, But Troiell full tydely turnyt hom agaynes, Kyld doun \u00feere knightes, and the kyng toke! He deliuert the lord, lete hym of hond; And fell of his foos fuersly \u00feat tyme. Telemonius Aiax come angardly fast, With \u00fere thowsaund \u00fero men \u00ferang into batell; Gird in with the grekes, & myche grym wroght, And mony tulke out of Troy tyrnit to ground. \u00deen \u00feurghe chaunse of Achilles & his choise helpe, \u00deai bere the burgh-men abacke to the bare walles: \u00deai bounet fro batell, & the bent leuyt, ffled all in fere frikly to toune! Mageron the mighty macchet with Achilles, Wold haue takon the talle kyng, & to toun led: He was a proude son of Priam, & a prise knight, And a wight man in wer, \u00feof hym woo happnit. Achilles were hym full wightly, & the wegh slogh; Bare hym bak to \u00fee bent, & the buerne deghit. \u00deen was clamur & crye for care of hym one, And myche dole for his dethe, \u00feat derit hom all! Telamon, the toure kyng, \u00fee Troiens pursuet; Paris hym put of, & preset hym sore, With other kynges & knightes, and the kyde brether; But hom worthe to \u00fee worse, wete ye for sothe, And soghtyn to the Citie in a sad hast! Than kaght \u00feai the corse of \u00fee kynges son, Broghtyn into burgh with baret & crye. When Ector herd of \u00feat hynde vnhappely was dede, \u00dean fraynit \u00feat fre, who \u00fee freike sloghe. \"Achilles the choise kyng,\" oon chaunsit to say, \"ffell hym in fight & fele of oure knightes!\" Ector, wode of his wit for woo of his brother, Haspit on his helme, & his horse toke; Went out wightly, vnwetyng his fader. Two Dukes full derne, he to dethe broght, And manly with mayn mellit with other; Kyld downe knightes, karve hom in sonder. Mony wondet the weghe, & to woo caste; Britnet hom on bent, and on bake put. The grekes, for his greffe, girdyn hym fro, Thay knew hym full kyndly be caupe of his sworde. Then the Troiens full tyte to the toune floghen, Issuet out egurly Ector to helpe; Gird evyn to the grekes, and hor ground toke; ffoghten full felly, and hor fos harmyt. Polidamas, the pert, was presset so fast, \u00deat he was wonen in wer, & away led: Than Ector in yre Egerly faght, And the grekes in his grem gird he to dethe,\u2014 Two hundreth in hast, \u00feat the hend led,\u2014 And deliuert the lede with his lyfe hole! This a grete of the grekes graidly beheld, Had meruell full mekyll, macchet hym to Ector, (Liochydes, the large, so \u00fee lord hight): He wend, the prinse in the prese haue put out of lyue. Ector wrathit hym with, and the wegh hit, \u00deat he deghit of the dynt, er he doun fell. Achilles, this chaunse choisly beheld, \u00deat so mony of \u00feaire men were marrid by hym, He hopit but if happely \u00feat hardy were slayne, \u00deat neuer greke shuld haue grace the ground for to wyn; Ne neuer Troye for to take, terme of hor lyue. He bethoght hym full thicke in his thro hert, And all soteltie soght, serchit his wit, On all wise in this world, \u00feat werke for to end, And the prinse with his power put vnto dethe. As he stode \u00feus in stid, starit hym vpon, Policenes, a pert Duke, \u00feat in prese rode, \u00deat was chere to Achilles, cherisit with loue, And thidur soght, for his sake, his sistur to haue, A mon he was of More Ynde, mighty of godes, \u00deere hit auntrid full euyn, \u00feat Ector hym met, And the lede with a launse out of lyue broght. Achilles the chaunse cheuit for to se: Vne wode of his wit, walt into angur. The dethe of \u00feat Duke he dight hym to venge. To Ector full egurly he etlit anon: Ector keppit the kyng er he caupe might, Drof at hym with a dart, & \u00fee Duke hit. Hit was keruond & kene, & the kyng hurt, And woundit hym wickedly thurght the waist euyn, \u00deat he sesit of his sute, soght he no ferre. THE DETHE OF ECTOR, BY ACHILLES TRAYTURLY SLAYN. Achilles for the chop cherit hym not litle, Braid out of batell, bound vp his wounde, Stoppit the stremys stithly agayne; Lep vp full lyuely, launchit on swithe, To \u00feat entent, truly, as the trety sais, To deire Ector with dethe, or degh \u00feere hym seluyn. As Ector faght in the fild fell of the grekes, He caupit with a kyng, caght hym anon; Puld hym, as a prisoner of prise for to wyn, With strenght thurgh the stoure, as the story tellus. His sheld on his shulders shot was behynd, And his brest left bare, so the buerne Rode, To weld hym more winly \u00feat worthy to lede. Achilles grippit a gret speire with a grym wille, Vnpersayuit of the prince prikit hym to, Woundit hym wickedly, as he away loked, Thurgh the body with the bit of the bright end, That he gird to \u00fee ground, & the gost yald. This Sedymon segh, \u00feat soght out of Troy: Evyn wode for \u00feat worthy was of lyue done, He cheuet to Achilles with a chop felle, \u00deat he braid to the bent with a brem wound; And for ded of \u00feat dynt the Duke \u00feere hym leuit. The Myrmaidons, his men, \u00feaire maistur can take, Bere hym on his brode sheld to his big tent, There left hym as lyueles, laid hym besyde: But yet deghit not the Duke, \u00feof hym dere tholit. Then the Troiens with tene turnyt them backe, Soghten to \u00fee Citie with sorow in hert, Entrid all somyn angardly fast, And the body of the bold prinse broghtyn hom with. When the corse of \u00feat comly comyn was to toun, Miche dole & dyn was dole [for] to here, With Sobbyng \u00fero the Cit\u00e9, & Syling of teris, With gawlyng & grete the grettist among. All the Citiesyns, for sothe, for sorow of the prinse, Miche water \u00feai weppit, wringyng of hond: The dit & the dyn was dole to be-hold! All the wemen of wit thurgh the wale toune, Wyfes, & wedowes, & worshipfull maidnes, Within houses & hallis hard was \u00feere chere. Wyth myche dole vppon dayes & on derke nightes, Sum walt into wodenes, & of wit past: The petie & the playnt was pyn for to here! Euer thai said in hor sagh, as \u00feai so might, \u00deai had no hope of \u00feere heale, ne \u00feere hede children, All hor trust \u00fean was tynt, truly \u00feai said, Thurgh the dethe of \u00feat dere, & done out of hope! \"Alasse, the losse and the lure of oure lefe prinse! Now sesit be oure Citie with oure sad fos; Our husbandes to hard dethe, & our hede slayne; We set vnder seruage, in sorow to abyde!\" On this wise all the weke, woke \u00feai within, With Remyng & rauthe, Renkes to be-hold. The body of \u00feat bold was broght to his fader, With all the kynges full clene, & \u00fee kid Dukes. With myche care & crie \u00feai comyn hym with, Rent of \u00feere riche clothes, ryuyn \u00feere chekes, And setton hym full sorily \u00feat souerain before. When Priam, the prise kyng, on the prinse loked, Suche a sorow full sodenly sanke in his hert, \u00deat he fainted for feble fell on his corse In a swone & a swogh, as he swelt wold. He was ded, as to deme, \u00feat day mony tymes, ffor the dole & the deire of his dere sone. Ne hade the buerne from the body bigly ben draghen, He hade doutles be dede, & his day comyn. Miche bale hade his brether, and his blithe sister: Hom hade leuer then the lond out of lyue be. What of Ecuba the honerable, \u00feat was his aune moder? The sorow \u00feat ho suffert were solly to here; & the dole of Andromaca, \u00feat was his dere wife, What blod & bright watur on hir brest light! & the sobbyng & the sorow, \u00feat sought hir within, Hit were tore any tunge tell hit with mouthe! The dole for \u00feat doghty of his dere fryndes, Of wepyng, & wayle, & wryngyng of hondes, Clamur & crie, crakkyng of fyngurs, Of \u00feo ledis \u00feat hym louyt, no lettur might tell! The body of this bold, \u00feat barely is ded, Most follow by fourme the freeltie of man: Hit may not long vpon loft ly vncorruppit, Ne be keppit thurgh kynd for vnclene ayre. Then Priam the prise kyng, prestly gert come Maisturs full mony, & men \u00feat were wise. He fraynet at \u00feo fre, with a fyn wille, How the korse might be keppit in his kynd holl, ffresshe, vndefacede, & in fyne hew, As a lede vpon lyue, likyng to se; And not orible, ne vgly of odir to fele. Then \u00feo maisturs gert make a meruelous toumbe, Honerable & auonand, in Apolyn temple, At the prayer of Priam, of a prise werke, Beside Tiberian, \u00feat in Troy was a triet yate, ffoundit full faire fele yeres past. There set was full solenly besyde the high aulter, A tabernacle triet & tristyly wroght, Of foure pillers vp pight all of pure gold: Like ymages were all, abill of shap, Lokend full lyuely as any light angels, ffro aboue to \u00fee base bright to be-hold, With full corius korse, & craftely grauen. Hit was atiryt vmb the top all with triet stones, Of all kyndes to ken, \u00feat clerkes cold deuyse. \u00deai lemet so light, \u00feat ledes might se Aboute midnyght merke as with mayn torches; And on dayes to deme, as by due sight, As beamys of bright sun, \u00feat braunchis olofte, This tabernacle tristy was tyrit on hegh, Vpon cristall full clere, clustrit with greses, As a gate fro the ground to the gay herse: \u00deat weghes might walke & waite \u00feerapon. Aboue on \u00feis bright, as the boke sayes, Thos maisturs gert make a meruelous ymage, All grauen of gold, a gret & a longe, Amyt after Ector, abill of shap, With a noble sword & a nait naked in his hond, Vp holdand on high as he \u00feat wold stryke: Turnyt to the tenttes of the tore grekes, With a lyuely loke, ledis to be-hold: The same fawchon full fell, \u00feat \u00fee freke bere, \u00deat had greuit mony grekes, & to ground broght, Hit was burnisshed full bright & of blade kene; And in mynd of \u00feat man for manas was holdyn. The body of \u00feat bolde, as buerne vppon lyue, Was full solemly set in a seate vnder, Ymydward the mayne towmbe with maistres deuyse. All the feturs of \u00feat fre, fresshe to be-hold, Iche lede on to loke, lemys & other All set for to se, saue the fete one, In soche apparell full pure, as the prince vsit. \u00dean \u00feo maisturs gert make, amyddes his hede, A hole \u00feurgh his herne-pon hertely by craft; There-in put was a pipe, with a prise oyntment Of bavme & of balsamom, \u00feat brethede full swete, With o\u00feer maters mynget, \u00feat most were of strenght,\u2014 Conseruatours by craft, \u00feat cointly were made. The bavme \u00feurghe his brayn all on brod ran, And the forhed before fresshly within; So hit entrid to \u00fee Ene, & evyn to his nase, And so be craft & by course come to his chekes, Goyng to his gomys and the ground of his tethe, \u00deat keppit hom be crafte all in clene vertue. So the face of \u00feat freike was fresshe to be-hold, With the here on his hede, \u00feat hogely was mekyll, And grew fro the ground, \u00feat gomys might know, As a lede vpon lyue; lefe if ye will! ffro thethen the lycour belyue launchit doun evyn, Thurgh the goters of his gorge, & the grete pype, To the brest of the buerne and the bare shulders; And past so by proces to his prise armys, Bret thurgh the bones and the big senowis, Euer folowand the fell to \u00fee fyngur endys. So hit soght to the sydes & serchit with-in, And keppit hom full cleane in hor kynd hew, \u00deat as a lede vpon lyue to loke on \u00feai ware. \u00deen hit sewit furth soberly, & sanke fro aboue, By the lyndes of the lede, to the leell theghes, Passond by poris into \u00fee pure legges; And so, be corse of the craft, com to his fete. In whiche fete \u00feere was formyt fresshly another, ffull of bawme \u00feat was bright, & of brethe noble. Thus keppit was this corse of the clene prinse, As a lede vpon lyue a full long tyme. \u00deen \u00feos maisters gert make, all with mayn crafte, ffovre lampis full light, ledis to beholde, \u00deat gay were & grete, all of gold fyne; ffild vp with fyre, \u00feat fynet not to bren; \u00deat no watur \u00feen wete in world might hom let, Ne the light make lesse ne the low fade. When this taburnacle atyrit was tally to end, Thai closit hit full clanly, all with clene ambur, Vmbe the borders aboue, \u00feat no buerne entrid, With a dore \u00feat was derne, all for dere fryndes ffor to loke on \u00feat lede, when hom lefe \u00feought, Or \u00feat soght hym to se in his sete holl. Then Priam, the prise kyng, puruait to leng Mony seruondis full solemne in the same temple,\u2014 Of prestes to pray, and pure men of lyffe, With worship to wale goddis, & wakyng on nightes. He gafe Renttes full Rife, & myche Ranke godis, All \u00feo ledis on to lyf, \u00feat longit \u00feerto, Bothe prestes and prise clerkes prudly to fynd. THE COUNSAILL OF AGAMINON AFTER THE DEATHE OF ECTOR. When Ector done was to dethe, & his day past, Achilles woundit full wothely in were of his lyffe, All the grete of the grekes gedrit were sone, By ordinaunce of the Emperoure, \u00feat after hom sent. Thus he spake for his spede his specials vnto:\u2014 \"Now fryndes, in faith, vs is faire happont, And \u00feroly, me thinke, we thanke shuld oure goddes, \u00deat hase grauntid vs \u00feat grace of \u00fee gome Ector, To be drepit to dethe thurgh dughty Achilles. ffor, while the lede was on lyf, & his lymes holl, We hade hertely no hope here for to spede, Yonder toun for to take, ne tene hom within, Ne in this lond, at our lust, lykyng to haue. ffor he hase kyld of our kynges, to count hom by nome, Prothesselon, Patroculun, & Policene als; Myrion the mighty, & the mayn Sedymon; Prothenor the pert, & the prinse Xancipun. Alphenor the fuerse flung he to dethe; Archillagon the choise choppit to ground; Domen the doughty, & derf Polexenas; Isum, also, abill of his dedys. Polipheten, a prise mon, he put out of lyue; Letabion on the laund \u00feere left he for ded; And mony grete of our grekes he to ground broght. Syn he be destany is dede, what dem \u00fear vs ellus, But the Citie to sese, & slyng it to ground; All the pepull to pyne put, and dethe at oure lust? And \u00feat shall douteles be done in dayes a few. And syn vs botis notto batell but vs bale worthe, Withoutyn the helpe and the hondes of herty Achilles, Hit is best \u00feat we byde, barly, me thinke, Tyll he be hole of his hurt, hast we no ferre. Let vs puruay to Priam prise men of wit, ffor to trete of a tru in trist of the bettur, Till two monethes & more be meuit to end, ffor to bery \u00feies bodies, \u00feat brittnet are to dethe, That storis vs with stynke, & our state harmys; And our hurtmen to hele, \u00feat harmys haue kaght.\" When his speche was spokyn, & sped to \u00fee last, All the lordes hit alowet, & lowten \u00feerto. Then sent were \u00feere sone soundismen two, To Priam, the prise kyng, purpos to hold; And he grauntid vngright with a good chere, And affirmet hit with faith to \u00fee frekis all. Within the tyme of \u00feis tru, as the trety sais, Palomydon the proud kyng playnet hym ofte, Of Agamynons gouernaunce in a grete yre. And as hit tid on a tyme, \u00fees triet kynges hoole Were somyn at a semly the souerain before, Palomydon put hym full prestly to say, And meuit of his mater, \u00feat I mynnet are. \u00dean Agamynon, full godely, agayn to hym said, Before \u00feo kynges in comyn on a cleane wise:\u2014 \"Now Palomydon, pure ffrende, pertly I aske, Whethur \u00feou hope it in hert, or hold in \u00fei mynd, That I am glad of \u00feis gouernaunce, to be gyde here: Syn I with prayer, ne with pursuet, preset not \u00feeraftur, Ne desyret hit in dede \u00fee dayes of my liffe. Ne neuer fortherit me a ferthing to fylsy my goodes; But oft wandrit, & woke, & in my wit caste; And my person enpayret, pynet me sore, ffor thes lordes \u00feat I lede, and the ledis all, And my suete all somyn, sound for to kepe Out of daunger and dole, & fro dethe holde. And yf this power be putto any prise kyng, Or any lord in oure land, hit likes me full well His biddyng to obey, and his bone here; And be gouernyt by that graithe, as his degre askes.

Ne, non hertly shalle hope \u00feat I am here fayn, Of his gouernaunce be glad, ne haue gret Joye; ffor hit is lykyng, by my lyf, & lusty for me, To chose another cheftan by charge of vs all; And his alligiaunce lelly I will loute to, With all the might \u00feat I may to maintene our werre. Ne, \u00fei self may not say, ne for sothe telle, Without assent of all somyn, sothely till now, \u00deat any dede has be don, or to dom past, But \u00feou in person aprevit, & all oure prise kynges, And by agrement of the gret, & \u00fee graunt hoole.\" When the souerain hade said, \u00feen he sest here; And of this mater no more was menyt at \u00feat tyme. The same day, Sothely, sais me the lyne, At euensangtyme afterward, Agamynon hym seluyn Somond all \u00feo souerains somyn to appere, And the knightes by course, Comyns & other, In presens of \u00feat prinse with \u00feere pure wittes.

Palomydon for prise the pert kynges toke, And ordant hym Emperour by oppyn assent, The ost for to honour, & agh hym as lord: And his alligiaunce to loute liked hom all. When cause of thies kynges was comyn to an end, All turnyt to \u00feere tenttes, when the tyme asket. Then hit chaunsit \u00feat Achilles of \u00fee choise herd, That Palomydon was prinse, & put doun the tother: Hit heuet hym hogely of \u00feat hard chaunce. Hit was vnfittyng, he said, \u00feere souerain to voide; ffor the graithnes of Agamynon, & the gret wit, Was passand Palomydon & the prinses all; And a choise shuld in chaunge be chosen for the bettur. But it comyn was be course of comyn assent, And confirmit by the kynges, he keppit hit for goode: No more in the mater mellit hym as then, But past furth to his pale, & here a pase endis.", "23": "Here Begynneth the xxij Boke: the Elleuynt Batell of the Citie. Euery Wegh, \u00feat will wete of this werke ferre, Lengis here a litle, lysten my wordes! When tyme of this tru turnyt was to end,\u2014 Two monethes meuyt, as I ment first, Priam, the prise kyng, purpast hym-seluyn ffor to deire for the dethe of his dere son. He bounet hym to batell on his best wise, And assignet hym-self souerains aboute, Tho ledis to lede, as hym lefe thoght. xx. M. thro knightes, \u00feryuond in armys, He assignet for hym-selfe at the same tyme, (As Dares breuyt in his boke, & barly can tell) & x. M. \u00fero men, \u00feristy of hond; And ffyfty M. fere, fell men of will, Turnyt out of Troy with the triet kyng. Deffibus drogh furth with his derfe pepull, Then Paris with prise put next after, \u00deen the souerain hym-selfe, the sure kyng Priam; Eneas afterward etlit anone, \u00deen [Menon], the mighty kyng, meuit to feld: MS. has Mirion Polidamas, the pert knight, presit on the last. When thies batels full bold were to bent comyn, Thay hurlit furth hard to the hegh laund, ffrickly \u00feere fos found for to greue. Palamydon, \u00feat was prinse of the proude grekes, All his Renkes had arayet, as he rede toke, And met hom with mayn, machit to-gedur. ffell was the frusshe, fey were \u00feere mony: Mony kynges were kyld, & kant men of armes! Priam to Palamydon preset so fast, \u00deat he gird hym to ground of his grete horse: There leuyt he the lede, launchet aboute, And fell in the feld mony fyn knight. Mony woundet \u00feat worthy, & wroght vnto dethe; Mony gird vnto ground, with his grym dynttes. Hit is wonder to wete, in his wode anger, How doghtely he did \u00feat day with his hond; Or \u00feat any freike vpon feld of so fele yeres, So mightely with mayn shuld marre of his fos. Deffibus, the derf knight, dang hom to ground ffuersly & fast, with a fell weppon. Kyng Seppidon, for sothe, a sad mon of strenght, Bounet vnto batell with a brem wille, And to Neptilon anon, a noble mon of Grese, As by stowrnes of strenght, streght on hym met. This Seppidon, for sothe, he set soche a dynt, That he gird with a grone to the ground euyn: But the freke vpon fote fuersly can wyn, Braid out a big sword, bare to hym sone With a dedly dynt, & derit hym full euyll Throgh the thicke of the thegh, throly with hond. The kyng of Persy came full prest with a proud batell, And Seppidon fro the Soile set vpo lofte. Thurgh the tulkes of Troy, & hor triet helpe, The Duke of Athens drogh in, & derf Menelaus, With a noyus nowmbur, nowble men all, Vmcloset the kyng and his knightes als. The kyng of Persy \u00feai put down vnto pale dethe; Bare the Troiens abacke, & myche bale did. In defence of his folke, the fuerse kyng Sepidon ffull worthely wroght with his wale strenght. Thedur Priam can prese with his prise knightes, And his noble sons naturell, \u00feat naitly hym folowet, On yche syde for his socour, soght hym aboute. Then the Troiens full tyte, in hor tore angur, Girdon to the Grekes with a grym fare. The noble Priam full prest put hom to ground, Slogh hom doun sleghly with sleght of his hond. Of all the Troiens so tore & tyd\u00e9 of wer, Was non so doughty \u00feat day, ne did halfe so welle, Ne so wight in his werkes, as the wale kyng, \u00deat for sorow & sorgrym of his sonnys dethe, Restouret hym his strenght as in stuerne yowthe. Then the Grekes by a-grement gedrit hom somyn, Betwene the Troiens & the towne, yf \u00feai turne wold, In companys cleane, knightes full mony, All pight on a playn, \u00feere \u00feai passe shuld. When the grekes with grem girde hom abacke, fforset were \u00feai sone with a sad pepull, \u00deat faght with hom felly, & mony frekes slogh. Hard hurlyng in hast, highet hom betwene. Mony buernes on the bent blody beronen! Ne hade Priam the prise kyng preset hom aboute, \u00deat was feghtyng in the feld on the fer syde, Myche murthe of his men & myschefe hade fallyn; And of his ledis ben lost mony lell hundrith. Parys \u00feen preset in with a prise batell Of noble men, for the nonest, naitist of wille, All with bowes full big, & mony bright arow; Gird euyn to the grekes, greuit hom full sore, Mony birlt on the brest, & the backe \u00feirlet. So greuit were the grekes \u00feurgh the gret shot, \u00deat \u00feai fled all in fere, & the feld leuit: Turnet to \u00feere tenttes, the Troiens beheld. Was no freke vpon fel[d]e folowet hom after, But soghten to \u00fee Citie with a softe pas, And entrid in Easely efter \u00feere wille: And all worshiptin the werke of \u00fee worthy kyng Priam, As for best of the batell, boldest of hond. The secund day suyng, when the sun rose, The Troiens to the tenttes tristy men send, ffor a tru to be tan, as the trety sais: (Whethur long, othir littull, list me not tell, ffor no mynd is \u00feere made in our mene bokes, Ne noght put in our proses by poiettes of old.) Within the tyme of \u00feis tru, the Troiens did aske The corse of the kyng, [that] come out of Pers, MS. has ' to ' ffor to bery in the burghe on hor best wise. ffor whom mournyng was made mekill ynogh, And prinsipall of Paris, that the prinse louit, \u00deat of faith & afinytie were festnet to-gedur; \u00deat ordant on all wise after his dethe, The souerain to send into his soile hom; On a bere to his burgh broght hym belyue, To be entiret trietly in a toumbe riche, As bi-come for a kyng in his kythe riche, In presens of his prise sonnes, as the prose tellus, That shuld be ayres after him auenond of lyue. THE SOLEMPNITE OF THE OBIT OF ECTOR, AND HOW ACHILLES FELL IN \u00deE MOMURDOTES FOR LUFF. Duryng the dayes of this du pes, The prise kyng Priam prestly gert ordan A gret solenit\u00e9, for sothe, all the cit\u00e9 thurgh, Xj dayes to endure, as for dere holy, In honour of Ector oddist of knightes, With Sacrifice & solenit\u00e9 vnto sere goddes. When thies dayes were done of the du fest, \u00deen ordant was on,\u2014oddist of all, A ffynerall fest, \u00feat frekes \u00feen vset, \u00deat become for kynges, & for kyd prinses, That most were of might & of mayn state. That in tymes of the tru the Troiens might wende, In-to the tentis by tymes, and tary while \u00feem list; And the grekes, agayne, go to the toune, To sporte hom with speciall, & a space lenge. Achilles hade appetite, & angardly dissiret, The Citie for to se, and the solemne fare At the entierment full triet of \u00fee tru prinse. \u00dean vnarmyt he entrid, euyn to \u00fee citie; To Appollo pure temple passit anon, There the body of the bold blithly was set, Of honerable Ector, as I ere said. There were plenty of pepull, prise men & noble, And worthy wemen to wale weping with teris, In sykyng & sorow syttyng aboute. The taburnacle titly vntild was aboue, On yche syde, as I say, who \u00feat se wold, \u00deere the body was aboue of the bold prinse, In his sete, as I said, sittyng full hoole, \u00deat arayet was full richely, as I red haue, With bame & with balsaum, \u00feat brethid full swete. At the fete of \u00feat fre was his faire moder, Honerable Ecuba, oddist of ladys, And Polexena the pert, \u00feat was his prise suster, With mony worshipfull wemen to wale in \u00fee towne, The here of \u00feere heddes hynging on brede, On backe & on brest bare for to shew; With remyng, & rauthe, & myche rife sorow, Sobbyng & sourcher soght fro \u00feere herttes. Polexena the pert pairet of hir hew, All facid hir face with hir fell teris, \u00deat was red as the Roses, richest of coloure, Hit was of hew to behold with hend men aboute. The teris \u00feat trickilt on her tryet chekes, As pure watur pouret vn polishet yerin, \u00deat blaknet with bleryng all hir ble qwite. The faire heris of \u00feat fre flammet of gold, All abouen on hir brest & hir bright swire, \u00deat sho halit with hond, hade it in sonder, And puld hit with pyn, pit\u00e9 to be-hold. When the hond of \u00feat hend to \u00fee hede yode, Hit semyt by sight of sitters aboute, As the moron mylde meltid aboue, When ho hasted with hond \u00fee hore for to touche. When Achilles the choise maidon with chere can behold, He hade ferly of hir fairhede, & fell into thoght. To hym-seluyn he said in his saule \u00feen, \u00deat neuer wegh in this world of woman kynd, Hade fairnes so fele, ne so fyne shap, Ne so pleasaund of port, ne of pure nurtur. As Achilles this choise in chapell beheld, A fell arow in his frunt festnet of loue, Woundit hym wickedly by will of hym-seluyn; And lurkid doun lagher to his low brest, All hatnet his hert, as a hote fyre, Made hym langwys in Loue & Longynges grete. Ay the more on \u00feat maidon the mighty beheld, The sarre woundit he was, & his wille hatter. Lo, so sodainly with sight in a sad hast, A whe may be woundit \u00feurgh wille of hym seluyn! Thus, Achilles by chaunse is chaltrid in grym, With loue of this lady, \u00feat ledis to \u00fee dethe. All the care of his cure the kyng has forgeton, And all meuit out of mynd saue the maidon one! When \u00fee day ouerdrogh to \u00fee due tyme, Ecuba the honerable, & hir awne doghter, Turnyt from the temple and to toune yode; Wentton hom wightly, weppit nomore. The lede loked hir after with a loue egh, ffolowand on fer, \u00feat fre to beholde, \u00deat was cause of his combranse & his cold dethe: \u00dean with langur of lust, & of loue hote, He was stithly astondid, stird into \u00feoght. So he passid the port, & his pale entrid, Turnyt into tent, takon full hard. The buerne into bed busket anon, Seke & vnsound, set out of hele: Mony thoghtes full \u00fero \u00ferang hym within, And was laburt full long in his lefe saule. He feld in his fare, & his fell hert, \u00deat the cause of his combraunse was the clere maidon. Thies wordes, in his wo, witturly he said, Soberly to hym-selfe, \u00feat no saule here:\u2014 \"Now wrecche full vnworthy, wo mot I \u00feole, \u00deat mony stalworth in stoure, & stuerne men haue kyld, Might non abate of my blysse, ne my ble chaunge. Noght Ector of all other, oddist of knightes, Hade no sleght me to sle, ne to slyng vnder, Ne ouercome me by course with his clene strenght. A ffrele woman me fades, & my fas chaunges, And has gird me to ground, & my gost feblit! Syn ho is cause of my care, & my cold angur, Att what leche vppon lyue might I laite hele? There is no medcyn on mold, saue the maiden one, \u00deat my sors might salue, ne me sound make. The whiche \u00feof I loue, & langwisshe to dethe, With prayer, with prise, ne with pure strenght, Ne for worthines of wer, ne of wale dedis. What wildnes, or worship, waknet my hert ffor to hap her in hert, \u00feat hates my-seluyn? In hir cuntre to come, & hir kyn sle, Hir fadur & hir fryndis, fond to distroy, And hir brother haue britnet, \u00fee best vpon erthe? On what wise in this world wilne shuld I hir, Most exilent of other, onerable of kyn, Of Rent, & of Riches, rankir \u00fean I, And passes of pertnes pure wemen all? Hit semith me vnsertain, all serchyng of wayes; Ys stokyn vp full stithly, shuld streche to my hele!\" \u00deen he turnys in his tene, & terys on his chekes Ronen full rifely, for his ranke sorow. \u00deen he driet vp the dropes, & dreghly can syle. On all wise in this world he his wit cast, ffor to wyn to his will, if werdis noght let. \u00deen he rose fro his rest in a Rad hast, Asket water at his weghes, wesshed hym anone, Refresshing his face for facyng of teres, And dride vp his dropes for dymyng his ene. HOW ACHILLES SENTTO ECUBA FOR HIR DOGHTER POLEXENA. Anon as the night passid, & neghid the day, Yet lastoon the lell tru the lordes betwene, He ordant to Ecuba, the honerable qwene, A message for the maiden by a mene frynd, Priuely to passe to the prise lady, \u00deat worthy to wilne to his wif euyn, And mell with a mariage & matremony hole, As a lady to liue to hir lyues end: On suche couenaund to kepe, yf \u00feat dere wold, He shuld procour the prinse, & the prise grekes, To pas fro \u00feat prouyns, payre hom nomore; And nought tary on the towne, ne no tene wirke, Withoute condiscoun, or cause, for to come after. The mon, \u00feat this message meuit for to do, Was a seruond full sure of the same kynges. When he hade told hym \u00feis tale, toght hym to go, He made hym redy full rad, ron to the toun, Esely to Ecuba etlit he anon, And all his charge, to \u00feat chefe, choisly he said. The worthy, to \u00feat wegh, \u00feat was of wit noble, Depe of discrecioun, in dole \u00feof sho were, Sho herknet hym full hyndly, & with hert gode, And onswaret hym esely, euyn on this wise:\u2014 \"ffrend, \u00feou shall fairly fare to \u00fei lord, And say hym vpon sewertie thy-seluyn with mouthe, In \u00feat at menys to me, with my might hole I shall filsyn \u00feis forward, in faith, \u00feat I can; But, I will say the, my son, or \u00feou sew ferre, I most wete all the wille of my wale kyng, And my sonnes, for sothe, or I say more, Yf \u00feai graunt will \u00feis grace, with a goode wille. ffull onsware, in faith I forme \u00fee not here, But come the thrid day, full \u00feroly, withoutyn \u00ferepe more, Sew to my selfe, & I the say wille Vne faithly before, as hit fare shall.\" When the messanger hade melit with \u00fee myld qwene, Than he lut to \u00fee lady, & his leue toke, Meuit to his maistur, & the mater told. \u00deen comford he caght in his cole hert, Thus hengit in hope, & his hele mendit: More redy to rest, ricchet his chere. This honerable Ecuba, eft, when hir liked, Preset vnto Priam, and Paris hir son; Caght hom in counsell, & hir cause told,\u2014 All the maner of the message from \u00fee main kyng. When Priam persayuit the proffer of \u00fee greke, Long he stode in a stody, or he stir wolde, Doun hengond his hed, herkonyng the qwene: Mony thoghtes full \u00fero \u00ferang hym within! Thus onswart \u00feat honerable euyn to his wif:\u2014 \"A! how hard were my hert, to hold hym as frend, That so highly me hyndret, & my hate seruet! All the leght has he lost fro my leue ene, Thurgh slaght of my son, \u00feat my sore ekys! ffor whose dethe, vppon dayes, all the derfe grekes Hertyn hom full hogely, my harmes to encres. But to fle all the offence, & fortune to come, In sauyng of my selffe & my sons als; \u00deat I may lyff in my lond in my last dayes, Out of batell & baret in my bare eld, I assent to \u00fei sagh, vpon soche wise, \u00deat he \u00feis forward fulfille, & before do, And with no gawdes me begile, ne to greue ferre.\" The prise wordes of Priam Paris alowet, And demet to be don, as the duke said, So \u00feat his wiffe, o nowise,\u2014worshipfull Elan,\u2014 Shuld be sent to hir souerain, ne seche vnto grece, But leng in \u00feat lond to hir lyues end. The \u00ferid day, full \u00feroly, \u00feriuond Achilles Sent his message, full mekely, to \u00fee myld qwene. He past to hir priuely, and the pert fond, And asket of \u00feat onerable onsware to haue. Thus said hym \u00feat souerain with a softe speche:\u2014 \"I haue wetyn the wille of my wale kyng, And of Paris, my pure son, prestly also: Bothe assenton to \u00feis sound, sothely, to me, On suche couenaunt to kepe, \u00feat the kyng shall All \u00feo forwardes fulfill, first, of hym-seluyn. All ys holly in hym, hold yf hym lyst, ffor to sew hit hym-seluyn, say hyt fro me: So hit keppit be in cource, carpit no ferre, Tyll yssu be ordant, after his deuyse.\" \u00deen be leue of \u00fee lady, the lede on his way Past at the port, & the pale entrid: To his maistur of his mater menit anon, All the truthe of the tale, tomly to end. Achilles was choise fayne, cherit hym the bettur, And now hatnis his hert all in hote loue: Myche myndit the mater, in the mene tyme, And to bryng hit aboute besit hym sore. Hit heuet his hert of his hegh proffer, \u00deat passit his pouer, to Priam the kyng; ffor hit longis to a louer soche a light vice, In the hete of his hert, for his hegh lust, To proffer soche prise thing, \u00feat passis his might, And festyn in forward, \u00feat hym for-thinkes after. Yet hopit he full hertely, for his hegh prowes, And doghtenes of dede with his dregh strokes, If he gright with the grekes to graunt hom his helpe, \u00deat \u00feai the lond shuld leue & lightly go home. \u00deen Achilles did cherisshe the cheftan of all. Palomydon, the prise, by purpos of hym, All the grete of the grekes gedrit hym somyn, To a counsell to come for the comyn proffet. When prinses & prise kynges were in pale somyn, Among tho mighty with mouthe menit Achilles:\u2014 \"Now, fryndes faithfull, in feliship here! Kynges, & knightes, & other kyde Dukes, That the charge, & the chaunse hase of \u00feis choise wer, Thurgh oure might & oure monhod maintene to gedur! What whylenes, or wanspede, wryxles our mynd? \u00deat for meuyng of a man, \u2014Menelay the kyng,\u2014 And the wille of a woman, as ye weton all, Oure londes haue leuyt, & oure lefe godys, Our childur, oure choise folke, & chefen fro hom Vnto a cuntre vnkynd, with care at oure herttes: Oure godys, oure gold vngaynly dispendit, And oure persons be put vnto pale dethe.

The Mirmydons were mony & of mayn strenght, Wise men in werr, wight of hor dedis, Graithe of hor gouernaunce, grym in a feld, Of all fetis enfourmyt, \u00feat to fight longit: Thai segh the troiens so tore & tentymys moo; \u00deai hade no might, ne no mayn, \u00fee men to with|stonde, But assemblit on a sop sadly to-gedur, And ay droghen o dregh, as hom deirit lest.

Thurgh the helpe of \u00feat hynd & his hond one, The grekes fleddon in fere, & \u00fee fild leuyt, Turnyt to \u00feere tenttes, taried no lengur, With all the hast of \u00feere horses, houet \u00feai noght.

But Pollexena the pert, with hir pure loue, Enforce so \u00feat fre in his felle angur, Abated the bremnes in his bale yre, And stoppet the strif of his strong hert; ffor hit meuyt to his mynd in the mene tyme, If he fore to \u00fee fild, and \u00fee fight entrid, That the Loue of the Lady lost were for ay, Withouten hope of \u00feat hynd to haue in his lyue, And vntrew of his trawth trust neuer after. Of the forword he fest with his fre wille, To Priam in priuete, and his prise qwene, Neuer in fild to be founden, ne his folke harme, Mony day he endurit in his depe thoght, And ay compast \u00fee cases in his clene hert.

There he found no defens, ne fightyng agayne; But as a ded mon to deme, \u00feat deiret no wight. Neuer hond vnto hond harmyt he nother, But as a caiteff, a coward, no knighthode at all.

Euen before in \u00fee frunt of \u00feat faire yle, Was a prouynse of prise, & praty men in; ffull of all frute, and fode of the best, Wond \u00feere no wemen, ne no wegh ellis, But men on \u00feat mold, & mony \u00feai were. Now the maner was most of \u00feo mylde wemen, Thre mones with mirthe \u00feo men for to viset; Euermore in Auerill auntrid hom so, With the monith of May, & the mery Ione, There to leng with hor louys in lykyng a while. Oft in wanton werkes wex \u00feai with childe, And sithen of solas soghton to \u00feere londes. When \u00feo burdis \u00feaire birthe hade borne of \u00feere sydes, If hit a woman were, with worship hit keppit, And fostred hit furthe vppon faire wise; And if \u00feat sam had a sun of hir selfe borne, Hit shuld be keppit full cleane, as \u00fee clause tellus, Thre yere thristely throngen to end, Than sent to \u00fee syre, and soiourne with hym. Thus tide hit \u00feat tyme, as I telle of, There was a lady in \u00feat lond, \u00feat be lyne aght All the kythe, & the crowne, & the kleane soile,\u2014 A maidon full of might, & monly in armys, Boldest in batell, best of hor hondes,\u2014 Pantasilia, \u00feat pert prestly was cald, That honerable Ector od myche louyt, ffor his prowes of prise, and his pert dedis, And for wightist in wer of \u00feis world \u00feen. Hit was told with a true of a tryet ost Of grekes \u00feat were gedrit to \u00fee great troye, Priam to oppresse, & his pure londes; And ho come for \u00feat cause, \u00feat kyng for to helpe, With hir maidons full myld, mightily in armys, A thowsaund full \u00fero, \u00ferepand in wer. ffor loue of \u00feat lede, \u00feat was of lyue past, To \u00fee Cit\u00e9 ho soght with hur sute hoole, Noght knowing the case of \u00fee kyd prinse, \u00deat the doghty was dede & drepid for ay. Whan \u00feat worthy hit wist of his wale dethe, Myche sorow & sykyng sanke in hir hert, And mony dayes for dole \u00feat doghty can wepe. This lady at the last lefte of hir sorow, And prayt vnto Priam all with pure wordes, His buernes vnto batell bainly to ordan, And pull vp a port, let hom passe furthe. Sho purpost hir plainly with hir pure maidons, The grekes to greue, & she grace hade, In fight for to fele of hir fell dynttes, And of maidyns might make hom to know. \u00dean Priam his prise men prestly comaundit, Philmen, the fuerse kyng, & his feres all, Eneas also, abill of dedis, Polidamas the pert, with a prise batell, With Pantasilia the pure prestly to wend. Dardan to vndo \u00fee doghty comaundit, And all fore to \u00fee fight in a frunt hole. The grekes gird hom agayn with a grym fare, And with launses on the laund lepyn to-gedur. Breme was the broche in the brest \u00fean! Pantasilia so presit proud Menelaus, \u00deat ho gird hym to ground with a grym dynt. The horse of \u00feat hathell hent ho belyue, And raght by the Reynes to a ranke maiden. Dyomede the derfe drofe to \u00fee qwene, With a course of his caple, and a kene speire. \u00deat mighty hym met with a mayn stroke, \u00deat he bend in the backe to \u00fee bare sadell, Vnneth held hym on horse for harme \u00feat he \u00feolet. Ho raght to hym radly, reft hym his sheld, And betoke [hit] full tite to a triet maiden. Telamon with tene turnyt to \u00fee lady, To venge of hir velany, & voide hym of harme. He launchit to \u00feat louely with a light wille, And ho keppit the kyng, kest hym to ground, Till his head with the hard yerthe hurlit full sore. So faght \u00feat freike with hur fyne strenght, \u00deat ho knowen was for kene with kaupe of hir swerd, And myche dut for hir dynttes or \u00fee day endit.

There delt \u00feai with dynttes, till the derke night, All left \u00feai for late & lackyng of Sun. Pantasilia the pert, and hir prise maidnes, Kyng Philmyn the fuerse, with his fyne knightes, The prise men of Pafigon fro \u00fee prese went, Soghtyn to the Cite with hor sute hole, Entrid full esely onon, as hom liked. \u00dean Priam was proude, & prestly beleuyt ffor to couer of care thurgh hir kyd helpe. HERE FAGHT \u00deAI TWO MONETHES. Two monethis with might \u00feai metton on bent, Bothe the batels full breme, as the boke sais, Duly yche day delton \u00feai strokes, Till Menelay the mene tyme hade the mere past To Lycomede, \u00fee lell kyng, & the lede broght,\u2014 Neptolon the noble, next to Achilles.

When he come to \u00fee cost \u00feere \u00fee kynges lay, Hym welcomyt tho worthy, as a wegh noble; And the mirmydons mighty, for maistur hym toke, Were glad of \u00fee gome, & gretly honouryt. The grekes fayne of \u00feat freike, and with a frunt light, Retaynit hym with Reuerence, \u00feo Riche men all, And honeret hym by ordinaunce with order of knight. Telamon full tyte, tristy of dedis, Gird hym full graidly with a gay sworde, Bad hym nait hit nemly, and noy of his fos, And dere for the dethe of his dere fader.

THE XXII & XXIII BATELL OF THE CITE. When hit drogh to \u00fee day, the Dukes with-oute Busket vnto batell, and the burgh alse. Tho mighty with mayn metton in the ffeld, And girdon to-gedur on a grym wise. Pirrus vnto prese put hym anon, In the honerable armys of his avne fader. Polidamas he preset with a prise swerd, With sleght for to sle, & slyng vnto ground; But hit passit his pouer, for his pure helpe Of Phylmen, the fuerse kyng, fendit hym wele. Pirrus, that proud kyng, presit so fast, \u00deat he gird hym to ground of his gret horse. He macchit hym with might \u00fee mon for to take, As by witnes in wer, & away lede: But the Pafigons prudly put hym agayn, Thaire lord to deliuer with his lyf hoole. The Mirmydons mightely mellit hom with, \u00deat \u00feai caght not the kyng, \u00feof \u00feai care \u00feolit. Pantasilia come pertly with hir pure maidnes, Brusshet into batell with a breme fare.

Tho myld with the Mirmydons mellit so hard, \u00deat mony worthy \u00feai woundit, & warpit to dethe. \u00dean Telamon come tyte with a tried wille, To Pantasilia preset with a proud dynt. He gird hir to ground, and greuit hir yll, And ho stithly in the stoure start vppon fote, Turnyt hir to Telamon tite with a swerd, Hit hym so heturly with a hert wille, \u00deat he hurlit down hedlonges to the hard erthe, And lay gronond on ground with a grym noyse. Than the maidnes with might, at the mene tyme, Theire lady vppolofte lyftyn onon, \u00deat was ffrike to the fight & of fyne strenght, And as lion on the laund launchit aboute. \u00deat worthy was war of \u00fee woo sone, How Philmen the fre kyng was fongid in hond; Sho macchit hir manly the Mirmydons to, With hir maydnes of might, & of main strenght. So \u00feo wemen in wer welton doun the knightes, Deyrit hom with dynttes, dryvon hom abacke, \u00deat all fled hom for fere, ferd of hor dethe. Pirrus \u00feis prowes pertly beheld, How his Mirmydons with might were mellit to ground: Philmen the fre kyng, \u00feat he in fyst hade, He lete to \u00fee large, lause of his hondes. He criet on his knightes with a kene wille:\u2014 \"Ne shamys you not shalkes to shunt of \u00fee fild, ffor the weiknes of wemen woundis a litell! Turnes yow full tyte, & taries a while, Let vs wend to yon wemen, walt hom of horse; With swyng of our swerdes swap hom in sonder, And dyng hom to dethe for deyring of other.\" Pantasilia the pride of Pirrus ouer-herd; Of his mote, & his manas, not mykell ho roght. When he neighed hur negh, naitly ho said \u00dees wordes to the wegh, \u00feat he well herd:\u2014 \"I am not ferd of \u00fei fare, ne \u00fei fell speche, \u00deof \u00fei fadur with falshed, & with foule treason, Honerable Ector egurly slogh: Whose vilany to venge, & \u00fee vile dede, All the world shuld wilne, wemen & oder. And we, \u00feat in wer, wemen ye call, Of oure dynttes dedly shall dele with you sone.\" Pyrrus wex pale at hir pure wordes, And come with a course of his kene yre, \u00deat doghty to dere with a dede stroke. The womon was war of his wille sone, And keppit hym full cantly: \u00feai caupit to-gedur, With \u00feaire glaiues full grym, on the grene laund, \u00deat Pirrus with pyne was putto \u00fee erthe, And his speire vntto sprottes sproungen on \u00fee qwene.

HERE THE KYNG COUNSELD HIS SON TO SLE ENEAS AND ANTENOR. The prise kyng Priam was prickit with sorow, And myche water he weppit of his wale ene; ffor he se hit him-seluyn, the sorow was the more, The trayn of \u00feo traytours, \u00feat truly were fals. He purpost hym plainly, for perell to come, Tho faitours with falsyng to fonge yf he might.

But oftsythes hit is sene, & sum men hath feld, \u00deat spokyn is in speciall, spredes o fer. In yche company is comynly a claterer of mowthe, \u00deat no councell can kepe, ne no close talis. To \u00fees traytours was told the entent of \u00fee kyng, On what wise in this world, no writ me declaris. \u00deai assemblit full sone of assent other, \u00deat knew of hor cast, & comynt to-gedur. All sweire \u00feai, full swiftly, vpon swete haloues, Neuer to councell to come, but in cleane armes, With a pouer of pepull purpos \u00feerfore, If euer the souerain hym-self sent for hom efte. This Eneas, of abell men was angardly grete, Of kyn and of cosyns, & kydmen of strenght: He hade fryndes full fele, fild of all goodis, And as plentuus of pepull as Priam hym-seluyn. Antenor also was abill of fryndes, Large of aliaunce, louet within: A Riche mon of Renttes, Relikes ynow, And fele of affynit\u00e9, \u00feat folowet hym after. Thies curset of \u00fee case hade comynt with the grekes, Hom-seluyn to saue & hor sad fryndes, Hor renttes, hor Riches, hor relikes also, ffor daunger, or deire, depely assurit. \u00dean the kyng vnto councell comaund hom bothe, To appere in his presens \u00feat purpos to end, ffor to trete of a trew qwill the tyme hade, And to dere hom with dethe, yf destany wold. \u00dean \u00feai comyn to \u00fee kyng with company grete, Of armyt men all somen, abill to fight. This Priam persayuet of the prise hoge, And sent to his son to ses at \u00feat tyme. The next day anone, the noble kyng Priam Somond all the cit\u00e9 somyn to appere, To carpe of a councell, & kyth hym hor wit, And to mell in the mater with his men all. When thei comyn were to courtte, this curset Eneas fferkit vppon fote and to \u00fee folke said:\u2014 \"Now, sirs, hit is sothely, me semes, for \u00fee best ffor to proffer hom pes, and purvey \u00feerfore.\" All his citizens, sothely, assentid \u00feerwith, ffor \u00feai knew not the caste of the curset chefe. The kyng to the komyns carpit agayne; To put of \u00feat purpos he paynet hym sore. Eneas with Envy egurly saide:\u2014 \"Sir kyng, of this case carpe \u00feou no ferre! We wull treate of a trew, I tell the for sothe, Whether \u00feou will, or \u00feou wilnot, wit \u00feou for|sothe!\" Than Priam persayuit all the pepull hertis, And feld well hit fortherit not the freike to with-stond: Hym was leuer to the ledis lelly assent, Than grucche \u00feere agayne, & greue hym \u00fee farre. He said hom full soberly with a sore hert, \"Dos of \u00feis dede as you dere thinke, I assent for my-selfe, and sadly afferme.\" \u00dean \u00feai comynd in the cas, castyn hor wittes, And with charge of \u00feat choise erend chosyn Antenor, As grettist by agrement, with the grekes to trete, And pursew for pes: this purpos \u00feai tokyn. \u00dean \u00fee troiens, full tyte, turnyt to \u00fee walles, With braunches full brode all of bright Olyue, As in proffer of pes puttyn O lofte, All the ledis on to loke, \u00feat lay in \u00fee feld. Than the grekes, by agrement, gyffen hom a signe, By cundeth to come, & carpe what hom liste. Than went fro the walles worthy Antenor, Past at a port to the pale tenttes. The grekes on the grene greidly hym met: To Agamynon gay tent gone all in fere, And present hym prestly to \u00fee prise kyng, Agamynon the grete, & the grekes all. To Dyamed the Duke, & doghty Vlixes, Assentid full sone all the sad pepull, To trete with Antenor trustid hom \u00fean. This forward to fulfill faithly thai swere, Vppon solempne sacrifice, soche as \u00feai vset. \u00dean the kynges into counsell caghton Antenor, And menyt of \u00feaire mater more at \u00fee tyme, There he hight hom to haue, holly at \u00feere wille, All the toun \u00feurgh his trayne, & the true kyng, ffor to bete doun & bren vnto the bare erth. Hym-seluyn to saue and his sib fryndes, And Eneas al o and all his sute hoole, With Renttes, & Riches, & all his Ranke godes. This in counsell to kepe fro knowing of other, Lest hit put of hor purpos, & paire at \u00fee end, All affermyt in faith of \u00feo faire soueryn, And knit vp \u00feere couenaunte in couert to hold. Kyng Taltill \u00feai toke as tristy to seme, \u00deat was greuit on ground, gronond in age, ffor he shuld lightly be leuyt with ledis of troy. Be-cause of his corage was kelit with age, He shuld turne to the toun, \u00feo traytours with all, To spir at hom specially of hor spede fer; If \u00feai hade wille to \u00fee werke, wete hom to say, With-outyn gawdyn or gyle, glose hit not lengur, And what godes \u00feai wold gyffe to the gret harmes, To affirme hit as fast, fynally for euer. Antenor also angardly desyret The body of the bold qwene, \u00feat in the burne lay, Pantasilia, with pyne to put into graue: With myche labur, at the last, \u00feo lordes hit grauntid. \u00dean the traytor vntrew, trust me for sothe, Toke leue at the lordes, & lowted hom all, With Taltillus, \u00feat other \u00feat I told first, And soghtyn to \u00fee Cit\u00e9 somyn belyue, Past vnto Priam, present hor wille, All the case of hor come, cantly with mowthe. The secund day suyng, sayes me the lettur, Priam, the prise kyng, prestly comaundit All the buernes of the burghe, bacheler & other, To appere in his presens the profer to make, And the tale of Antenor vntristy to here, Of his message by mouthe, what he mene wold. When \u00feai comyn were to court, comyns & other, Antenor his tale tombly began. He thoght his falshed to feyne, vndur faire wordes, And his cautels to colour vnder coynt speche. He said in his sermond, \u00feat sothely the grekes Were of pepull & pouer plaintius mony; And how \u00feai depely desyret with a due hert, To haue suertie full sad of a syker pes. Thus sotelly with sothyn he set hom a cas, What fortune might falle vndur fals colour. \u00dean nemmyt he what noy, the noble men of troy Enduret on dayes, dole for to se: With weping & waile, wo to be hold, And myche sykyng & sorow on our sad knightes. \"To abstene of \u00feis stoure & our stithe harmes, Soche langour to let, & lotis vnfaire, Hit is wit, as I wene, wayes to seche, Soche dole & deire to dryue to an end.\" \u00dean he said in his saw, \u00feat sothely the grekes Wold not agre to \u00feat graunt, but for a gretesowme Of gold, & of godis, & of gay Iuellis, With stuff to restore for hor stith harmys. Wherfore, to qwheme & to white vs of skaithe, Euery buerne in \u00feis burgh, \u00feat is best storit Of meblys, & money, & of main syluer, Helpis now hertely \u00feis harme to redresse: ffor bettur is a buerne by hym sum pes, \u00dean in wandreth & woo to wepe all his lyue. And for he kowth not by course come to an end, All \u00feere wille for to wete at \u00fee wale tyme, He couet at the kyng, & all the kyd pepull, Eneas eftsones \u00feat erend for to wend With hym-seluyn, for-sothe, on \u00fee same nedis, All \u00feere wille for to wete & wayne at \u00fee last, And for \u00fee grete of \u00feo grekes shuld no gawde wene, But leue hit more lelly & listyn the bettur. All the pepull in \u00feat presse, \u00feat the prose herd, Afermyt hit as fyn \u00feat \u00fee freike said. Eneas after this, euyn with \u00feat other, And Taltilus, tombly to \u00fee tenttes yode. All the councell fro kourtt was clenely depertid. Priam with pite \u00fean past to his halle, Myche water he weppit wringyng his handes. Hit was dole to the dethe \u00fee Duke to behold, Euer hedyng in hert of the hegh treason, \u00deat was cast for \u00fee kyng, of his kyde fryndes; And for the losse and the lure of his leue sons, \u00deat so dawly were ded, and drepit for ay, So worthy in wer, & so wale knightes. \u00deat he left was o lyue his lure was so hoge! \"And now is nedfull for noye, \u00feat neghis at hond, All my gold for to geue, \u00feat I getyn haue, Kepid in hurd, holdyn full long; And I vnsure of my-self, my sorow is the more. \u00deus in pouert am I pyght, put vnder fote, \u00deat makes me full mad, & mournes in my hert; And yet this lure were but litle, & our lord wold \u00deat I might leng in my laund, & my lyf haue.\" Thus Priam with pit\u00e9 playnet hys doole, On what wise for to wirke wist not hym-seluyn. He was forset vnfaire to folow \u00feere wille, \u00deat purpost hom plainly to put hym to dethe. Elan \u00feat euermore was egur of sorow, Herd tell of the trety was takyn with the grekes. \u00deat noble on a night, \u00feat no man persayuit, To talke with Antenor toke ho the gate. Sho prayet hym pourly with hir pure hert, Of Menelay, hir maistur, to make hir a frynde; And proker hir pes with his prise wordes, \u00deat she might at \u00feat myschefe to mercy be takyn. All grauntid the gome to \u00fee gay qwene, ffor to proker hir pes, & pyne hym \u00feerfore: \u00dean ho lowtid the lede, & hir leue toke, And past to the palis of the prise kyng. With-in the tyme \u00feat I tell, \u00fee tru sun of Priam,\u2014 Glaucon, was grauyn in a gay towmbe; And the body of \u00fee bold qwene broght vnto toune, Pantasilia, with petie of hir prise maidons. Hit was ordant of all men by oppon assent, \u00deat Philmen the fre kyng shuld ferk hit hym with, And bryng on a bere to hir burgh home, To be enterit in a towmbe, as a triet qwene, And laid by hir legis, \u00feat the lond aght. Eneas eftir \u00feis Egur of will, Antenor, also, angardly fast To the grekes on \u00fee grene girdyn on swith, ffor to trete of hor trayne as traytouris vnlell. There met \u00feai \u00feo men, \u00feat I mynt first, \u00deat were grauntid by the grete of the grekes all, ffor to mell in \u00fee mater, & meue to an end. The towne to betray truly \u00feai \u00feoght: And of Elan, euermore, egerly fast \u00deai meuit vnto Menelay at the mene tyme; And had graunt of \u00feat grete with a good wille, All hir gilt to forgiff, and to grace take. Than Agamynon, as grettist, \u00feo grete for to wend,\u2014 Dyamede he demyt, & doughty Vlixes,\u2014 With tho worthy to wend to the wale towne, As in maner of message fro the mayn grekes. When \u00feai comyn into courtte the comyns were fayne, ffor \u00feai wise were of wit, & worthy men bothe. \u00deai hopit well the heldur to here of an end, And the traitur \u00feai trist of a tru pes. The next day onone, as the night past, By comaundement clenly the councell was gedurt, All the pepull to the palis of the prise kyng Were assemblit full sone, set all aboute. Vlixes full lyvely vp olofte said:\u2014 \"The grekes for hor greme vnto gre asken Gret sommes, for-sothe, to hor sad harmes, Bothe of gold & of goodes, er \u00feei go wille, ffor the losse & the lure of hor lef pepull; And Amphimakus, the fre sun of the fyn kyng, To be exiled for euermore, as Enmy of toune, Neuer in plit to Repaire to his pure fryndis, Ne the Cit\u00e9 to se, while hym-selfe lyues.\" This prokert full prestly with prayer before, The traytor Antenor to the tru kynges; ffor \u00feat noble hym denyet naitly or \u00fean, When he proffert to priam pes for to make. Lo! how fortheris a freike with a fyne wit, ffor to kepe hit in close, & carp hit no fer; To speike in despite & Spedis no more, But hyndres full heghly & harmys hym-seluyn. Lo! Amphimac the fre, for his fell wordes, Was dampnet in-dede, \u00feof \u00feai du were; Ellis the traytor Antenor hade truly no cause ffor to procur his payne, and his pale harme. But god, \u00feat all giltis godely beholdis, And wrangis in his wrathe writhis to ground, Oft-sithes in the same settis to fall A man with \u00feat mesure he metis till another! To Antenor hit tide, tellis the story, An exile for euermore efter a while, Thurgh Eneas, \u00feat egurly exit \u00feerto, As I shall tell full tite, when the tyme askes. While thies kynges were in councell, \u00feat comyn fro \u00fee grekes, Within the palis of prise, as the prose tellus, There was an orible noise, \u00feat noyet hom full sore, As a clamour or a crye of a cant pepull, As \u00feai satyn all somyn sodainly come, Vne playne in the place \u00feere \u00fee prise met. ffor doute of hor dethes, tho doghty men bothe Were a-ferd of the fare and the fell noise, Lest the troiens for tene hade takon hom sone, And dungen to dethe for dole of the knight, Amphymacus the fre, \u00feat the freikes louet, ffor ertyng his exile in ernest before. Hit was aspiet full Specially, & spird all abowte, The cause of the crie and the cant noise: There was no wegh in this world, \u00feat hit wete kowth, Ne to meue in hor mynd what hit mene shuld. The kyng & the councell cantly can rise; Depertid the pepull, past to \u00fee toune Bothe knightes & comyns, and the court voidet. THE TRAYTOR ANTENOR toke into counsell, Dyamede he drogh furth, & dughty Vlixes, In a place \u00feat was priuey & no prese in, To forther his foule wille, \u00feat no freike herd. Vlixes to this other vtterly said:\u2014 \"Why draghes \u00feou on dregh \u00fees dedis so ferr? \u00deat \u00feou vs heghly hase het, hold hit onone!\" \u00dean talkes the traytour truly agayne:\u2014 \"Ourgoddis knowen full kyndly \u00fee cast of my hert, That no dede I desyre so depely in thoght, As your hestes to hold with helpe of Eneas. Lelly, the lett, \u00feat vs long taries, Is a statur full strong of a stith god: \u00deat ye shall lelly me leue, & yow list herkon,\" Diamede said duly;\u2014\"\u00feou do vs to wete, Vs likes full lelly to listyn \u00fei wordis.\" Antenor \u00fean talkis, & told on \u00feis wise:\u2014 \"Hit is lelly no lesyng, leue if ye will! There was a kyng in this cost, \u00feat the kith aght, Honerable, auenaund, & Vlus was callit. Here foundit he first the faire place Ylion; After the nome of \u00feat noble, nemyt hit is. Here he tild vp a temple of a trew godde, Of Palades the pure, as prouit is of old. Whan the walles were wroght to \u00fee wale rofe, All clanly by course vncouert aboue, A selly \u00feere sene was with seremen aboute, Gird to \u00fee ground fro the grete heuyn, A ffygur full fyne, festnyt in the wall, Wondurfully wroght by wit of a god. At the end of the auter etlit to stond, Euer sithen, for-sothe, to this selfe tyme. Neuer buerne was so big to beire hit away, Saue kepers of the kirke, for craft vppon erthe. The mater hit is made of is most of a tre, But no clerke is so corious to ken vs the nome; Ne on what wise hit is wroght can wit shew, But \u00feurgh Palades the pure god, apperit \u00feer \u00feurgh. Seche trust haue the troiens truly \u00feerin, While hit keppit is in kirke, or in clos walle, With-in the cercle of \u00fee Cit\u00e9, as said is of old, Neuer the toune shalbe takon with tene of hor fos, Ne care fro the corone, ne the kynd aire. Thus lelly beleuyn the ledis of \u00fee toune, And neuer dowtyn no dethe to dere hom with-in. The nome of \u00feis noble, \u00feat naitly is keppit, Paladian the pure, with pepull is callid.\" Than Diamede the Duke duly can say:\u2014 \"Iff thy saghes be sothe, & sad to beleue, All our labur is lost, & our long sege, If Paladian with purpos may put vs away.\" Antenor alstite amet to speike:\u2014 \"If ye meruell so mekyll we make you non end, And high not with hast our hestes to kepe, This is truly the entent we tary so longe. I haue comynt with the keper, & cumpast aboute, The stature to steile stithly by night, ffor a certain somme of syluer & of gold: And full prestly \u00fee prest hase puruayet \u00feerfore. When hit laght is lelly, leue me for sothe, Hit shalbe sentto your-selfe, seche hit no ferther: \u00dean hope may ye hertely, to haue in a while The Cit\u00e9 and the soueran, sese as you likes. But kepis this in councell, for cas \u00feat may falle, \u00deat no wegh in \u00feis world wete of our cast; And I will kaire to the kyng for a cause yet, And feyne me with fare to forther our werkis.

THE ORDINAUNCE OF THE TRYBUTE. Than carpis to the kyng curset Antenor, All the Cit\u00e9 to assemble hym-seluyn before. When comyn were the knightes, comyns, & all, Thes wordes he warpit \u00feo worthy vnto:\u2014 \"I haue comynt in this case, knowith hit your|selfe; To the grekes bus vs gyffe, to graunt vs for pes, Twenty thowsaund thristy, \u00ferungyn to-gedur, Markes full mighty, all of mayn gold, And of Syluer, for-sothe, the same \u00feai dessyre: To whyte vs, of whete, qwarters \u00feai aske X.

While this gode was in gederyng the grettes among, Antenor to the temple trayturly yode; Preuely the prest puld into councell, (Thoantes, me tellys the text, \u00feat he heght, \u00deat was geeter of the god, \u00feat the gome yernyt.) With a gobet of gold, a full gret somme, And Thoantes betaght, tarit no lengur.

There is no greuaunce so grete vndur god one, As the glemyng of gold, \u00feat glottes \u00feere hertis: Hit puttes the pouer of pristhode abake, And forges to the fend a forslet with-in.

WHEN THE GOLDE was all gotyn, & the grete sommes Of qwhete, & of qwhite syluer, qwemly to-gedur, Into Myner mykell temple maynly was broght, And put vnto pure men till payment were made; Hit plesit to Appollo, the pure god aboue, With Sacrifise solemne, besoght at \u00feat tyme, With bestis, & briddis, britnet full mony, And the carcas full clanly kowchit on \u00fee auter.

Fol. 180 is awanting in MS. See Note. [Amongst these things, Calcas and Crisis the Priest, counselled the Greeks that they should make a great Horse of Brasse, and that must be so great as might hold within it a thousand knights armed: and they said unto him that it was the pleasure of the godes. This horse was made by a passing wise Master, as Apius was, whose name was Sinon, and he made it so sub|tilly, that no man could perceive any entry or issue, but within it was easie for them that were inclosed within for to issue out when they would. When the great horse was fully made, and the thousand knights therein, by the counsell of Crisis, they prayed the King Pryamus, that he would suffer this horse to enter into the city, and that it might be set in the Temple of Pallas, forasmuch as they said, that they had made it in the honour of Pallas, for a Vowe that they made for restitution of the Palladium, which they had caused to be taken out of the same Temple. Among these things, the Princes that were yet within Troy, when they saw that the King had so shamefully treated with the Greekes, they went away out of Troy, and tooke their men with them, and the King Phylomenus led no more but two hundred and fifty men, and threescore maydens of Amazones, that were left of a thousand that came thither with the Queen Penthasilia, and carryed the body of her with them, and trauelled so long till they came to their owne Country.", "30": "The xxix Boke: Off the takyng of the toune, and the deth of Kyng Priam. Then came the day that the Greeks should sweare the peace fainedly vpon the plaine field vpon the Sanctuaries. King Priamus issued out of the City and his people, and sware there each party to hold the peace firmely from thenceforth on: and Diomedes swore first to the Greeks: after, when they had broken the peace that they had treated with Anthenor of that thing that they concluded after, and therefore they maintayned that they were not forsworne by that colour,] Guido di Colonna: from The Ancient Historie of The Destruction of Troy . Sixth Ed. London, 1635. But in prouerbe hit is put with prise men of wit, 'Who \u00feat sweyres to be swike, he forsworne worthes.' Thus the grete of the grekes grymly \u00feai sware ffast pes to afferme, & flit of the londe. Priam on his part, & his prise knightes, Sweryn all swiftly, & no swyke thoghtyn: So wend he full wele, \u00feo worthy kyngis all Hade no malis in mynd, ment at the tyme. \u00dean honerable Elan \u00feat abill deliuert, Comendyng \u00feat clere all with cloise wordes, Prayng the prise men with [his] pure hert, \u00deat no harmys \u00feat hend shuld haue of hir lord.

Eneas \u00fean ertid Egurly fast, And Antenor also, the abill kyng to:\u2014 \"Hit is due to be done, & doutles,\" \u00feai saide, \"The sight is full solemne, the Cit\u00e9 to haue Ay lastond to long, \u00feat ledis may knowe \u00deat soche acord was here knyt with kynges for euer.\" The kyng affirmet the faitours, & no fraud thoght; \u00deaire dessire for to do demyt onone. \u00dean payet kyng Priam all the pure sowmes Of gold, & of gay syluer, & of goode whete: All \u00feai shot into ship on \u00fee shire water, And made hom Redy to Rode on \u00fee rough ythes. All the grekes hom gedrit, the grettist & other, With Sacrifice solemne, synging of prestys: With profession & prise puld furth the horse To a Side of the Cit\u00e9, and set at \u00fee yate. Hit was so borly of brede, & of brem heght, There was no entre with ease abill \u00feerfore: \u00dean the warpit downe the walle, & the wale toure, Bothe obreade & aboue brekyn the yates, Tyll hit might entur at ease, euyn as hom list. \u00dean \u00fee Citasyns, with song & solemnete grete, Halit furth the horse to \u00fee hegh temple.

Thies buernes of the burgh blyndit were euyll, \u00deai halit in no horse, but hor hard deth, Oppression and payne, pyt\u00e9 for euer; And ay lastond lure for lakkyng of wit! One Symon, a sure mon, assignet was \u00fee key, \u00deat was of gouernaunse graith, by the grekes all, To warp up a wicket, & waite on the tyme, And the durres to vndo of the dregh horse. But se first the Cit\u00e9 were on slepe fallyn, And broght into bed, as hom best lyked: \u00dean the ffreike shuld frusshe out, & a fyre make, And light vp a low with a light wille, \u00deat the ost might haue entre euyn as hom liked. And the bettur in the burgh bale for to wirke, The same day, sothely, the Cit\u00e9 was takon, To Priam, the prise kyng, thai puruait a message, Said hom-seluyn wold saile samyn fro troy, And turne vnto tenydoun, & tary \u00feere a qwyle, Preuely the pert qwene by purpos to take, ffor clamur & crie of the comyn folke:\u2014 The murmur was mykell of \u00fee mayn pepull, Lest \u00feai dang hir to dethe in hor dull hate. Hit plesit well Priam \u00feat purpos to hold, ffor he hedit no harme, ne no hate thoght; To \u00fee gawdes of the grekes gefe he no kepe, But all semyt hym full sothe the sawe of \u00fee kynges. \u00dean the grekes by agrement gird into shippe; With proses and pres puld vp \u00feere ancres; Launchit fro the laund to the low sea; And fayne were the freikes of \u00fee faire towne. \u00deai turnet vne to tenydon, & tariet all \u00feere, Before the settyng of the sun, says me the lyne, With melody, & myrthe, & myche lowde songe, And there taried on the town till hom tyme thoght.

This Othe, I er said, the od sun of Naule, Dissiret the dethe of the derf kynges,\u2014 Agamynon to grefe, & the gay Dyamede,\u2014 And to hyndur hom in hast, & hit hap might, And \u00feai past to \u00feere prouyns & no payn \u00feole. This Othe, with ournyng, ordant belyue Letturs, by a lede \u00feat he leell trist, To Agamynon gay wif, gert hym to beire, \u00deat Clunestra was callid, as the clause tellus. To hir he certifiet sothely in his sad lettur, \u00deat Agamynon had goten to his gay spouse, Of Priam a prise doghter, prayset full mekull: Hir he broght in his barge to his burgh hom, \u00deat faire forto feffe in his fre londes: And ho mvn douteles be dede, & done fro hir right. \u00dean he counseld Clunestra, er \u00feat cas fell To be war of \u00feat wegh, & wait on hir-seluyn. The lady leuit the lettur \u00feat the lede sent, And \u00feonkit hym \u00feroly with \u00feonks in hir hert: She compast by course, in hir clene wit, How this vilany to venge, & voide of hir harme. OFF THE DETHE OF AGAMYNON AND \u00deE EXILE OF DYAMEDE BY \u00deERE WYUYS, FFOR THIS LETTUR. When this worthy of wothe wan to his reame, Out of perell and pyne of the pale ythes, Clunestra, that clere, come hym agayne, His worshipfull wife, with a wale chere; Resayuit hym with Reuerence, as Renke to his owne, With a faynond fare vndur fals thoght. This Clunestra the clere, as the clause tellus, ffor lacke of hir lord laiked besyde. Whille he faryn was to fight in a fer lond, Sho spilt hade hir spousaile, sparit ho noght: And lodly in hir law the lady hade synnet. Engest, with his Japis, hade Justilet hir with, And getyn in his gamyn on the gay lady, A doghter \u00feat was dere, in hor derne play. Nawther comyn was \u00feat kyde mon of no kyng riche, Ne duke \u00feat was doghty, ne no derfe erle; Yet ho heght hym to haue, hol\u00e9 at his wille, All the Rioll rewme with renttes ynow. This Clunestra vnclene cast with hir loue, By assent of hom-selfe, sone at \u00fee night, The bold kyng in his bed britton to dethe: All Slepond to Sle with sleght of hom bothe. And so fell hit by falshode, fer in the night, When the bold in his bed was broght vppon slepe, \u00dean entrid this Engist, euyn as hym list, And, with a thricche in the throte, throtlet the kyng. When this Duke was dede, & done unto graue, Clunestra at kirke couplit onone This Engest, with Jolite to hir iuste spouse: Of Mechenas she made hym maistur & syre. This Agamynon the gret hade a gay sone, Consayuit of Clunestra, \u00feat cald was Oresties: He was yong & yepe, of yeris but lyte. Kyng Taltill hym toke for trist of his lyue, And send hym full sone to a sure frynd, Ydimius, for doute lest the derfe qwene Mortheret hym with malice in the meane tyme. He was keppit full close, & with cleane hert, And worshippit on all wise as \u00feere wale son, Ayre to \u00feere herytage aftur hom-seluyn. This Othe, I ere said, od son of Naule, To Egea, afturward egurly send, The dere wife of Dyamede, dernly a lettur: Gert the lady beleue on a laithe wise, He hade puruait a prowde wife of Priames doghter. This Egea, the gest sais, was a iust lady, To Polence, the prise kyng, vne a pure doghter, (Kyng of Argonen cald in cuntres aboute) And hade a brother full bold, & barly no moo. ffaire on hir fader syde, as fell hom by chaunse, All the londes full large of the lefe kyng, Polence of price, \u00feat was hir pure fadur, Lefte to \u00feo litle, as his leue heires. \u00dean partid was prestly the prise Rewme of Argon, Betwene Assandrus for-sothe, & his suster Egea. This Egea ajoinet to hir iust spouse, Dyomede the dughty, with hir due part. Assandrus, for-sothe, sais me the lettur, With Dyomed dernly dressit to wend To the terage of Troy with a tore ost; And er \u00feai comyn to the company of \u00fee clene grekes, There all semblet were sothely at \u00fee same tyme, \u00deai past by a perty of \u00fee prouyns of Boys, There Thelafus \u00feat tyme was a tore kyng. There \u00feai bowet fro \u00fee barge to \u00fee banke syde, To solas hom a season with sum of hor pepull. Thelaphus with tene toke hit to hert, \u00deat \u00feai light on his londe, & no leue hade: He fore to \u00feat folke with a fell chere, With a company clene, kyde men of armys. There faght \u00feai in fere with a felle wille, And kild of \u00feere knightes to \u00fee cold erthe. This Assandrus, I said you, with a sad weppyn Mony dong to the dethe of his derf knightes: There-at Thelaphus hade tene, & turnet belyue, Caght to a kene spere, cuttyng before, Caupit euyn with the knight; kyld hym to dethe. \u00dean Dyomede with dole drogh hym vp sone, Hade hym fro horse fet with helpe of his knightes; And myche water, I-wis, weppit \u00feerfore. This was clerely the cause of \u00feat knightes dethe, Yet his suster, \u00feat I said, sothely was told, \u00deat Diamede with dethe had done hym away, ffor to wyn by his wyff all the wale rewme. The lady for the losse of hir leue brother, Myche mournyng ho made in hir mynd \u00fean: Hir hade leuer haue lost all hir lond hole, \u00dean hir brother ho best louet of buernes olyue. Thus heuet \u00feat hynd to hir hede lord, ffor tithinges hor tolde were of hir tru brother, And the lettur with the lesyng, \u00feat the lede send, (Naulus the noble, by his naite sun) Ho assemblit hir suremen in a sad oste, And warnet hom wightly the mater to kepe, And Diamede on \u00fee depe dryue from \u00fee lond. Thus the bold kyng was banisshet fro his big yle, All will of his wone his werdis to laite. And Sythen, vnto Salerne he soght on his way, There Teucro, the tall kyng, tan was for lorde, \u00deat was Brother of birthe to \u00fee bold Thelamon. To Teucro was told of Thelamons dethe, That Dyamede, the Duke, had dernly conspiret With Vlixes the lorde, \u00feat hym of lyue broght, Gert take hym full tite in his tore angur: But he stale fro \u00feat stithe stilly by night, Wan into watur, & away past. Demaphus the du kyng, & dughty Athamas, On suche wise, with \u00feere wiues, were wernet \u00feere londes. \u00dean come \u00feai to Cartage, with care at \u00feere hertes, There the noble Duke Nestor naitly hom toke, And welcomyt tho worthy on a wise faire, With all hor company clene, as \u00feere kyd ffrynd. There purpost \u00feo prise men, with a prowde oste, Thaire owne londes to lacche, & the ledes qwell: But the noble Duke Nestor onon to hom said:\u2014 \"Ames you of malice but a mene qwile; Sendis fro youre-seluyn to your syde londis; Tretis hom truly all with tried wordes; Hetis hom hertely to haue all hor hert wille, Of ffredom, & ffranches; fret with hom so, And all your will shall ye wyn, & no wegh harme.\" So hit happit \u00feo hynd in a hond qwile, To com to hor kyngdomes & hor kyth home, With fauour and frendship of freikes with-in, And were welcome, I-wis, to wyues & other. Eneas, \u00feat afterward auntred to leng In Troy for a tyme, as I told haue, His gold & his godis to gedur into ship, And his fraght on the flode fully to make,\u2014 Ofte faght \u00feat freike & folke of the Cit\u00e9, With Enmys enerdande in ylis aboute. When the toun was takon & turnyt to ground, The kyng & his knightes kild to the dethe, There come out of castels & of cloise townes ffro the bowerdurs aboute, \u00feat hom bale wroght, Pilours and plodders, piked \u00feere goodes, Kyld of \u00fee comyns, & myche care did. Eneas \u00fean afturwarde egurly counseld, Syn he was banysshed fro the burgh, & bode \u00feere no lengur, \u00deat \u00fee pepull by purpos prestly shuld send ffor Dyamed the dughty, with his du helpe, To fight with hor fo-men & forther \u00fee lond. The troiens full tite token his rede, Sendon for the sure kyng in a sad hast, Where the fre might be foundyn, & fet hym to Troy: And he come to \u00feat cuntre with a cant wille. All the ledys of the lond lyuely were fayn, \u00deat were helples & hard stad, & \u00feere hede lost, \u00deat Eneas was also euyn in the toune, Noght faryn with his flete, ne the flode takyn. \u00dean \u00feai busket to batell, \u00feo bold men in fere, Armet at all pes, with abell to werre, \u00deat were left vppon lyue, logget within. Seuyn days, sothely, sais me the lettur, \u00deai faght in the ffild with \u00feere fuerse enmyes. Dyamed full dughtil\u00e9 did with his hondes, And mony britnet on the bent of hor breme fos: Mony toke he \u00feat tyme and to toune led, And hongit hom in hast vpon high galowes. The fyfte day of \u00fee fight so fuersly he wroght, \u00deat no buerne was so bold his birre to with|stond, But all fled of the feld, & fongit were many; And ay hongit \u00feo harlottes, as \u00feai hent were, Bothe on galous full grym, & on gret trees, \u00deat none left were on lyue in the lond sone. Owther captains of castels, or kepars of tounes, Herd suche hardship happyn to falle Of freikes vnfayre, that fore to \u00fee Cit\u00e9, And all the costes full clene keppit hom away, And neuer did hom no deyre, ne no dole after. Whan En\u00e9 hade all thing ordant at wille, His Shippes on the shyre water shot full of goodes, Relikes full ryfe, & myche red gold, With Anchises his choise (fader) chefe into flete, MS. has ' moder .' And halit furth hastely to \u00fee high see, As hym demyt was by dome by dukes before. He not wist, in this world, what wayes to hold, Ne, what cost, ne cuntre, come vnto laund. At the last, as our lord wold, he light into hauyn, After in Itaile, as aunter befelle, Tegh vnto Tuskan, & turnyt to londe. Now what worthe of \u00feat whe, & his wale godis, ffro he Tuskan had takyn, tellis hit not here. Of his wondurfull werkes who wilnes to know, Go loke at the lede, \u00feat his lyfe wroght. Virgell, full verely, \u00feos vertus can tell, In a boke \u00feat buerne of \u00feat bold made, \u00deat Enyodos, with noble men, is to nome cald. The Dere wife of Dyamede of his dethe herd, How he turnyt vnto troy, & the toune keppit Of his ffrikenes in fight & his fyne strenght: Ho dout hir full deply, for drede of \u00fee kyng, Lest he raght to his rewme with a roid fare, Kyld all hir knightes & comyns by-dene, And hir-seluyn ouerset, & sesit the londe. \u00dean Egea, full iointly, with hir ioly knightes Toke counsell in the case, & comynt to-gedur. The lady by lettur \u00fean louely send ffor Dyamede \u00fee derfe, \u00feat was hir du lorde: \u00dean he turnyt fro Troy to his triet Rewme. With myche worship his wife welcomyt hym home, And his Arguens also, all were \u00feai fayn. Othir kynges of \u00fee kith, \u00feat comyn fro troy, \u00deat were put fro \u00feere prouyns, Repairet agayne, Recounseld to \u00feere cuntre, comyns & other, And were welcom, I-wis, to wyuis & all. \u00dean \u00feai Byld vp hor Burghes & hor big tounes, \u00deat were enfeblet before for faute of \u00feaire hedes, With the Tresors of Troy, & the tore Relikes, And other Riches full rife, and restid hom \u00fean.", "34": "There Begynnes the xxxiij Boke: Now Oreste toke bengianse for his fader dethe. Agamynons hawne sone abill of &yogh;eris, \u00deat ydumius the dere kyng only had keppit ffor ferd of his fos, \u00feat his fader slogh, Engestus with Iapis shulde Iuge hym to dethe, Was waxen full wele & wight of his dedis. xx ti wintur, I-wis, the wegh was of age, And forther by foure, fuerse of his strenght. \u00dean honered hym \u00feat od kyng with ordur of knight; Gaf hym of his gold, & his gay stedis, And hight hym of helpe with a hede pepull. Orestes \u00feat onerable oftymes prayet To ffilsyn hym with folke his fo to dystroy, His cuntre to kouer, & his kid rewme, And to deire for the dethe of his dere fader. The kyng grauntid agayne with a gode wille. A thowsaund \u00fero knightes, \u00ferepond in wer, He assignet for hym-selfe to his sad helpe: And so luffet was the lede in the lond \u00fean, \u00deat as mony able men after was grauntid. \u00dean Orestes full rad with his ronke knightes, Come to the Croeze, the cuntre within There Forenses the fre kyng fairly can dwell. He was neghbur full negh to \u00fee noble yle, There Agamynon the gode gouernaunce hade; And was Enmy full euyn to Engest with-all, And held wer with \u00feat wegh winturs full mony. This Forenses with fyne will faithfully prayet, \u00deat he might ryde with \u00feat Orest & his ranke oste, To Ioyne with Engest for his vniust werkes, With \u00fere hundrith \u00ferifty, all of \u00fer[i]ed knightes: And he \u00feriftely, with \u00fero hert, \u00feanket the kyng. And so busket the bold fro the burgh sone. Hit was the moneth of May when mirthes begyn; The Sun turnyt into tauro, taried \u00feere vnder; Medos & mountains mynget with floures; Greues wex grene, & the ground swete; Nightgalis with notes newit \u00feere songe, And shene briddes in shawes shriked full lowde. Orestes full rad, with his ranke knightes, And Forenses, the fuerse kyng, faryn of toune. \u00deai meuit vnto messan with \u00feere men hole. All refusit hom the folke of \u00fee fyne plase. When he segh \u00feat the Cit\u00e9 sate in defens, He besegit hit full sadly vppon sere halues, \u00deat no buerne of the burgh durst to bent come: And so keppit he the close of his clene Cit\u00e9. He had answare of Appolyn abill before, \u00deat he his fomen shuld fell & his folke wyn, And his moder for hir malice martur to dethe, ffor all the helpe \u00feat ho h\u00e1de & the hegh walles. This Engest with Iolite & Iournay was gone, To secche hym sum frekes with hor fyn helpus, Of Bachelers & bowmen the burgh to defend. Orestes full radly the Renke hade aspiet, What way \u00feat he went, as weghes hym told. He purpast hym priuely in pathes to lye. Knightes, at his comyng to kacche hym olyue, \u00deat mekill were of might, & of his men qwelle. The Cit\u00e9 he assailet with a sewte ofte, \u00deat the folke to defend failet o sythes. Thai werit of \u00feere werke \u00fee wallis to kepe, And no buerne of \u00fee burgh \u00feere aboue stode. The XVtene day fuersly he felle to \u00fee toune, He toke hit full tite, & tomly he entrid, With all his company clene of kyd men of armys. He comaundit his knightes for keping the yatis, ffor Repaire at the port, or presyng the yatis. He past to the palas of his prise ffader, There caght he Clunestra, \u00feat closit was in. He put hir in prison, prestly to kepe, And all the Rebellis full rad rappit to dethe, \u00deat were assent to the slaght of his sure fader. The same day, sothely, the Cit\u00e9 was takyn, Engeste with Ioly men aioynet agayne The Cit\u00e9 for to socour with his sad help. Noght warre of the weghes, \u00feat waited his harme, Past furth thurgh the pase with his proude knightes: A busshement of bold men breke hym vpon; Kyld all his kant men, kaghtyn hym seluyn; His hond bounden at his backe, hym to burgh led. The secund day suyng, sone in the morne, Orestes his renkes radly comaundet, Bare to the barre bryng hym his moder, Hir hondes bounden at hir backe bigly with ropes. Than he went to \u00feat worthy in his wode yre, And the pappis of the pure puld fro hir brest With a knyfe \u00feat was kene, cast hom away; And with the swing of a swerd swappit hir to dethe. He comaund the corse cacche vp onone, And hurle with a horse to the hegh feldys, And cast hit as karyn vnto kene foles. There the lady on the lond lay for to rest, Till the flesshe of \u00feat faire was fret of the bones, To draghen be with dogges & othir derfe briddes. Engest he adiuget, for vniust werkes, Nakid thro the noble toune onone to be drawen, \u00dean in hast for to heng vppon hegh galowes, With all the traitours vntru, \u00feat he toke \u00feere. Thus he vengit the velany, & the vile grym Of the dethe, \u00feat hym deiret, of his dere fader. Thus the lady was lost for hir lechir dedis, \u00deat vnhappely for horedam hastyd to sle Agamynon the goode, the grettist of kynges, And most worthy to wale while the world last. ffor ho keppit not hir klennes with a cloise hert, Thus fell hir by fortune to haue a foule end. HOW MENELAY WAS WROTHE FFOR THE DETHE OF CLUNESTRA. When Menelay the mighty & his men all Were comyn out of care of the cold ythes, With honerable Elan, \u00feat was his aune wife, To the cuntre of Crete \u00feere the kyng dwellit, Hit was told hym full tyte of his tru brother, \u00deat done was to dethe with a derf traitor; And how Orestes full rad, with a roid fare, Hade marterid his moder for malice \u00feerof. All the comyns of Crete & the kyd lordes, On the lady to loke longit full sore, ffor whom the grekes so grymly were to ground broght. So Eger were all men Elan to se, ffor to waite on \u00feat worthy went \u00feai belyue. Then the Seniour full sone, with seasonable windes, Cairet fro Crete with his clene nauy, Meuit vnto Mecayne with his men all, And faire Elan his fere ferkit hym with.

Now, of Pirrus by proses I purpos to telle, When he turnyt fro Troy how hym tyd after. To Achilles the choise he was a chere sun, And Dyamada doutles his own du moder. She was a doghter full dere of the derf kynge, Lycomede, a lord \u00feat he louyt wele. Two worthy had the wegh to his wale graunsers, Bothe, kynges in hor kythe with corone anoyntted.

He hade hate in his hert to \u00fee hed kyn Of Pirrus progeny, and prestly to hym. What causet the kyng to his cleane yre, Tellis not the trety, ne trespas of olde. This Ascatus with skathe skerrit of his rewme Pelleus, with pouer, \u00feat the prouyns held Of Thessaile truly, as the tret\u00e9 sais; And a-waited with wyles \u00fee wegh at his come, Pirrus with pouer to put vnto dethe. After the takyng of Troy and the tried godes, Pirrus passed furth to \u00fee pale ythes.

The secund day suyng, as said is of olde, He was coroned to kyng in \u00feat kithe riche, By assent of the seniours & the sure knightes, In \u00feat souerain cit\u00e9, with septur in hond. \u00dean be fauer & frenship, \u00feat fell to hym after, He enhaunset his hede heghly aboue All the londis and the lordship, \u00feat longed to Gryse; And his cuntre keppit in couert & pes To the last of his lyf, as a lord shuld. Here I turne from my tale, & tary a qwile, Till hit come me be course to carpe of hym ferre. When Idumius was ded, doghty of hond, \u00deat I told of tomly in tymis before, Two sones of hym-selfe suet hym after, In his realme for to reigne, as his right ayres: Merion, a myld & mighty, was one, And Laertus by lyne was his leue brother. This Merion hade maistri but a meane qwile, The lond to Laerte he leuyt as kyng, And after course of our kynd closit his dayes. Telamecus, the tall son of tryet Vlixes, \u00deat Nausica had, \u00feat noble nam vnto wife, Doghter of the du kyng, doghty Antenor, He gate on \u00feat gay vne a gode sone, \u00deat Dephebus duly was demyt to nome. Now I pas will to Pirrus by proses agayne, Of his dedis to deme, & his dethe after. Ascatus \u00fee skete, for skath of his sones, Miche water he weppit of his wan chekis, Gert bryng hom to burgh, birit hom faire In a precius plase, so Pirrus comaundit. THE POETE: OF FORTUNE. Wen a mon is at myght, & most of astate, Clommbyn all \u00fee Clif to \u00fee clene top, Has riches full ryfe, relikis ynow, All \u00fee world at his will, weghis to serue, \u00deen fortune his fall felli aspies, Vnqwemys his qwate, & \u00fee qwele turnys; Lurkis in lightly with lustis in hert, Gers hym swolow a swete, \u00feat swellis hym after. So Pirrus was prise, pruddest of kyngis, Had welth at his will, \u00fee worthiest of grice. A longyng vnleffull light in his hert, Gert hym hast in a hete, harmyt hym after. Ermonia, \u00fee myld, \u00feat myght\u00e9 dissiret, Elanes aune doghter, abill of chere, \u00deat Orestes \u00fee rynke richeli had weddit, By mariage of Menelay, as I mynt haue. So he sped hym by spies, & spense of his gode, \u00deat \u00fee lady fro hir lord lyuely he stale, Toke hir to tessail fro hir tru maister, Orestes \u00fee riche, that regnyt hir with. Pirrus with that proude presit to \u00fee temple, Weddit \u00feat worthi, & as wif held. \u00deen Orestes full ryfe had myche rank sorow, Schamyt with \u00fee schalke, that schent of his wife, And so dernely hym did dere & dispit. He had playnly no power Pirrus to harme, To his reme forto ride & reue hym \u00fee qwene; But he cast hym by course, if a case fell, To venge of his vilany & his vile schame. \u00deen Pirrus by purpos prestly con wend Into delphon a day, as \u00fee dule bad, In honour of apolyn, \u00feat abill to seche, And worchip with wyn, as a wale god, With sacrifice solemne & othir sere halows, ffor offens of his fadur, \u00feat felli was slayne With Paris, \u00fee pert knyght, as preuyt is before. In aparell of prise, on a proud wyse, He dight hym to delphon with dukis & othir. In his palais of prise prudly he leuyt Worthi Ectors wif, \u00feat \u00fee whe had, Andromoca, in drede, and her dere son Lamydon \u00fee litill, \u00feat ho left neuer, And ho boundyn with barne with \u00fee bold Pirrus: And Ermonia \u00fee myld maynly was ther, \u00deat he had weddit to wyue, & in wrong held. Wen Pirrus was past, \u00feis proud in hir yre, A mon vnto Menelay myghtily sende, Bad hym turne vnto tessail in a tore hast, Andromaca to dere, & to deth put; ffor Pirrus of \u00feat pert was pristly enamurt, He had no daynt\u00e9 with dalianse his doghter to loue. \u00dee whe, at \u00fee wordis of his wale doghter, Turnet vnto tessale with a tore ffare. He wold haue britnet \u00fee burd with a bare sword, And schunt for no schame, but hit schope faire. Andromaca, for drede of \u00fee derf kyng, Lamydon hir litill sun laght in hir armes, Hyghet out of halle into hegh strete, Made an ugsom noyse, \u00feat noyet \u00fee pepull, With wepyng and waile wo to beholde. \u00dee folk, for \u00fee fray, fel to \u00feaire armur, Cayrit after \u00fee kyng in a cant hast. \u00deen fled he for fere, fell to his schip; Past to his prouyns, of purpos he sailet. THE DETHE OF PIRRUS, BY ORESTES SLAYNE. Orestes full radly of the Renke herd, \u00deat Pirrus by purpos was past into delphon: He assemblit of soudiors mony sad hundrith, And met hym with mayn in the mekill Ile: There Pirrus with payne he put vnto dethe, Slogh hym full sleghly, & slange hym to ground, And britnet \u00feat bold with a bigge sword. Then Pirrus the proude was pute vnto graue, Orestes by right raght to his wife, And led furth the lady to his lond hom. Pelleus full prestly and his pure qwene, Tetid, full tite tokyn Andromaca, Hir litill sonne Lamydon leddon hir with. \u00deai turnet out of tessaile for torfer of other, To melapsa \u00feat menye mevyt to-gedur, Was a Cit\u00e9 full sure, \u00feere soiornet \u00feai long, Till the lady was deliuer of a loue sone. Andromaca \u00feat dere \u00feat duly conceyuit Of Pirrus the prise kyng, as his pure wife. The child with chere men Achilides was cald. Wex & wele threvan in winturs a few, The corone & the kyngdome kyndly he gaffe To Lamydon the lord, \u00feat was his leue brother, The abill sone of Ector, heire vnto Troy, And in Thessaile he was takyn for a tru kyng. Thus Achillis achevit his awne choyse frendes, Thurgh his prokuryng prestly all the pure Troiens, \u00deat the grekes hade getton at the great toune, Were deliuert yche lede, & lause at hor willne. And thus hit turnyt, as I tell, in a tyme short, Now is Lamydon lord, & the laund hase, Bothe the corone & the kyth, and a kyng noble Of Tessaile truly, \u00feere the toyle rose, \u00deat by Eritage of Auncetry ayre vnto troy. Here the prosses of Pyrrus I putto an end, Of other maters to mene, \u00feat in mynd falles. HERE YE A MERUAYLE OF A LADY BY NYGRAMANSY.

Anone as the night past, the noble kyng sent ffor Devinours full duly, & of depe wit. When \u00feai comyn were to court, he the case told Of the note in the night & the new dreme. All wiston tho wise, by the weghis tale, He shuld duly be ded of his derfe sone. Hit fell hym by fortune of a foole end. \u00dean Vlixes the lege kyng, of his lyf feerd, Telamocus he toke, his tru sone, Stake hym in a stith house, & stuerne men to kepe, Wallit full wele, with water aboute. Thus he keppit hym full cloise, & in care held, \u00deat no whe to hym wan but wardens full sure.

The mon at his moder mekely toke leue, fferkit to the flode in a felle hast. The lady hir leue son lyuely can pray, To hie hym in hast hom to his moder. The buerne vnto bote busket onone, Past ouer the pale and the pale ythes. So long had he laburt, & the lord soght, \u00deat he come to Acaya, \u00feere the kyng dwellit.
