[986] Such was \u00fee confessioun of \u00fee publican \u00feat wolde nou&yogh;t heue vp his ey&yogh;en to heuen. For he had offendid god of heuen For which schamefastnes; he had anon \u00fee mercy of god [987] \u00b6 And \u00feere seith seint augustyn \u00feat such schamefast folk ben next for&yogh;euenes of remissioun [988] \u00b6 The secounde signe is humilite of confessioun \u00b6 Of which sai\u00fe seint petre humblith &yogh;ow vnder \u00fee might of god. \u00fee hond of god is my&yogh;ty in confessioun For \u00feer-by god for&yogh;iueth \u00fee synnes he alone ha\u00fe \u00fee power.

For certis ih&umacr; crist for \u00fee gultes of oon man was obedient to his deth [998] \u00b6 The o\u00feer condicioun of verray confessioun is \u00feat it hastily be doon.
