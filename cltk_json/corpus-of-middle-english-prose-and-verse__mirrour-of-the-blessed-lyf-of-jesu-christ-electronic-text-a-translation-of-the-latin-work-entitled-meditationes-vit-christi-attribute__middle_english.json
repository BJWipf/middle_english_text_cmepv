The &slong;ecounde is: to be &slong;uget\nto his euene like in e&slong;tate / and not to be hi&yogh;ed or preferred\naboue his vnderlynge.  The thridde and the &slong;ouereyne\ndegree of mekenes is: to be &slong;ugett and lowed to his vnderlynge\n/ that is he that is la&slong;&slong;e in e&slong;tate than he.  And this\ndegre kept oure lord Je&slong;u at this tyme whan he meked\nhym and lowed hym to John\u00b7 and therfore &slong;o he fulfilled\nalle the perfeccioun of mekenes. \u00b6 And than whan John &slong;awh oure lordes wille that\nmo&slong;te nede be doo / he didde as he badde and bapti&yogh;ed\nhym there.

And in that he\n&slong;pake not with his mouth / he tau&yogh;t vs in dede\u00b7 and that thing that he tau&yogh;te after by worde / nowe he &slong;pake\nby en&slong;aumple\u00b7 that is: Lerneth of me / for I am mylde\nand meke in herte.  For of the &yogh;outhe of oure lorde in\nto this tyme of xxxti &yogh;ere I here or rede but litel more.\nBut now may he no lenger be hidde / &slong;ithen he is &slong;o\nopounly &slong;chewed of the fader.

And &slong;o haue\nwe here en&slong;aumple of oure lorde Je&slong;u to with&slong;tonde the\nvice of glotonye: for there mo&slong;te we bygynne &yogh;if we wil\nouercome othere vices / as the enemy comounly bygynneth\ntherwith to a&slong;&slong;aile hem that taken hem to goo&slong;tly lyuynge.\nWherfore as it &slong;emeth he that is ouercome with that vice\nof glotonye / that while he is feble and vnmy&yogh;ti to ouercome\nand with&slong;tonde other vices\u00b7 as doctours &slong;eien in this place\nof the go&slong;pell / that bot glotonye be fir&slong;t refreyned / man\ntrauailleth in veyn a&yogh;en&slong;t othere vices. \u00b6 Afterward the deuel toke hym vppe and bare hym\nin to Jeru&slong;alem / that was fro that place aboute viij myle\nas men &slong;eien / and there he &slong;ette hym vppon the pynacle\nof the temple where he tempted hym of veyne ioye /\ncoueitynge to knowe as he didde bifore whether he were\ngoddes &slong;one.  But here was he al&slong;o ouercome by auctorite\nof holy writte\u00b7 &slong;o that he lo&slong;te fully his purpos: in that\nhe hirte hym not as a man by pride / and hym &slong;elfe was\nneuere the wi&slong;ere of his godhede.  And here haue we en&slong;aumple of pacience / con&slong;iderynge the grete benignyte\nand pacience of oure lord Je&slong;u / that &slong;uffred hym &slong;elf to\nbe handeled and borne of that cruel bee&slong;t that hated hym\nand al that he loued. \u00b6 And after that tyme / as &slong;eint Bernard &slong;eith / the\nenemy &slong;eeng that he &slong;chewed no thing of the godhede /\nand &slong;uppo&slong;ynge therby that he was not god / tempted\nhym after as a man.  At this thridde tyme whan he toke\nhym vp efte and bare hym a&yogh;en in to a ful hi&yogh;e hille / by\n&slong;ide the for&slong;eide hille of Quarentena / as the &slong;pace of two\nmyle / and there he tempted hym of auarice and therwith\nof ydolatrie.

The whiche ben more reprouable as in that\nparte than Judas\u00b7 for they &slong;een not Je&slong;u bodily by&slong;ide\nthat &slong;acrament as he didde\u00b7 and therfore it is li&yogh;ter to\nhem forto byleue / and more to here dampnacioun &yogh;if\nthey byleued not / as god hym &slong;elf and holy chirche\nhathe tau&yogh;te: namely / &slong;ithe that trewe techynges of this\nbli&slong;&slong;ed &slong;acrament hath be holden &slong;tedfa&slong;tly &slong;o manye\nhundred &yogh;ere / and of &slong;o many holy men / martires and\nconfe&slong;&slong;oures / and othere trewe cri&slong;ten men\u00b7 the whiche\nin to her la&slong;te dayes &slong;toden with outen doute in this feithe\nand dei&yogh;eden therynne.  The whiche feith is this in &slong;chorte\nwordes: that the &slong;acrament of the au&yogh;ter duely made by\nvertue of cri&slong;tes wordes is verrey goddes body in forme\nof brede / and his verray blode in forme of wyne\u00b7 and\nthou&yogh; that forme of brede and wyne &slong;eme as to alle the\nbodily wittes of man brede and wyne in his kynde as\nit was bifore\u00b7 neuertheles it is not &slong;o in &slong;othene&slong;&slong;e / bot\nonely goddes fle&slong;che and blode in &slong;ub&slong;taunce.

Wherfore &slong;ithen we\nmaken &slong;ollempne the fe&slong;te of one &slong;eynte that is pa&slong;&slong;ed out\nof this worlde to heuene / miche more we oweth to do of &slong;o\nmany thow&slong;andes / and &yogh;it pa&slong;&slong;yngly of hym that is &slong;eynte\nof alle &slong;eyntes.  Al&slong;o this is &slong;pecially the fe&slong;te of oure\nlady\u00b7 for al&slong;o moche as this day &slong;che &slong;eye hir bli&slong;&slong;ed &slong;one\nJe&slong;u / verrey god and man / &slong;o gloriou&slong;ly crowned as\nkyng / &slong;tey vp to heuene.  &YOGH;it al&slong;o this is propurly oure\nfe&slong;te\u00b7 for this day was fir&slong;te oure kynde exalted and lift\nvp aboue the heuenes.

And therfore &slong;eith\n&slong;eynt Bernard in a &slong;ermoun of this fe&slong;te of the a&slong;cencioun / Sermone iiijo / in confirmacione of my for&slong;eide &slong;entence / that this glorio&slong;e fe&slong;te of the a&slong;cencioun of oure lorde Je&slong;u\nis an ende and fulfillynge of alle othere &slong;olempnitees and\nfe&slong;tes / and a ble&slong;&slong;ed conclucioun of all the iourney of\noure lorde Je&slong;u after his manhede.  Thus mowe we\nopounly &slong;ee that this day and this fe&slong;te is mo&slong;te hi&yogh;e\nand &slong;olempne of alle othere.  And that &slong;oule that loueth\ntrewely oure lorde Je&slong;u &slong;chulde this day be more raui&slong;ched\nto heuene and more goo&slong;tly ioye haue in herte thanne yn\nany day of the &yogh;ere.  For thus &slong;eide oure lorde Je&slong;u to his\ndi&slong;ciples: If &yogh;e loueden me / &slong;othely &yogh;e &slong;chulde be glad\nand ioyful that I goo to the Fader.

And &slong;o this\nioye and this &slong;ollempnyte durede in to the day of penteco&slong;te\n/ wherof we mowe deuoutely ymagyne and haue\nmeditacioun in this manere. \u00b6 The A&slong;cencioun of oure lorde was at the &slong;ixte houre\u00b7\nfor byfore he ete with his di&slong;ciples at terce.  Thanne\nmowe we thus ymagyne that thoo ten dayes fro that\nhoure that he a&slong;cended in to the houre of the holy go&slong;t\n&slong;ende / the nyne ordres of aungelles with the holy fadres\nand &slong;oules that he toke vp with hym made hym ten\nfe&slong;tes\u00b7 and he a&yogh;eynwarde rewarded hem &slong;pecially in &slong;om\n&slong;inguler coumforte euery day.  And &slong;o though alle that\nwere thanne in heuene generally were of his a&slong;cencioun\nioyeful / and made &slong;o murye a fe&slong;te that no tonge can telle\u00b7\nneuertheles &slong;pecially the fir&slong;te day fro the houre of his\na&slong;cencioun in to &slong;exte of the next day folowynge aungelles\nmade her fe&slong;te.

After that oure lorde Je&slong;u was gone vp to his\nbli&slong;&slong;e / and the aungeles hadde beden the di&slong;ciples\nto torne a&yogh;en in to the citee / as hit\nis &slong;eide next bifore\u00b7 they with his bli&slong;&slong;ed\nmoder wor&slong;chepynge hym and ki&slong;&slong;ynge deuoutly the\n&slong;teppes of his feete / where he la&slong;te touched the erthe /\nas the go&slong;pell of luke telleth / they went a&yogh;eyne in to Jeru&slong;alem\nwith grete ioye / and there they abiden the comynge\nof the holy goo&slong;t / contynuely in deuoute prayeres louynge\ngod and ble&slong;&slong;ynge oure lorde.  And whan the tenthe day\nwas comen fro his a&slong;cencioun / that was the fifte day fro\nhis re&slong;urrexioun / oure lorde Je&slong;u ioynynge the figure of\nthe olde te&slong;tament with the newe / for al&slong;o moche as the\ntyme of grace was in that day come / he &slong;eide to the fader\nthus: My fader / haueth now in mynde the byhe&slong;te that\nI made to my bretheren of the holy goo&slong;t.  And the fader\nan&slong;werde: My dere &slong;one / I am wel apayde of that byhe&slong;te\u00b7\nand now is tyme that hit be fulfilled.  And more\nouer he &slong;eide to the holy goo&slong;te: We preye the that thou\ngoo doun to oure di&slong;ciples / and that thou fille hem of thy\ngrace: coumforte hem / &slong;trengthe hem / teche hem / and\n&yogh;eue hem habundaunce of vertues and ioye.  And anon\nthe holy go&slong;t came doun with a wonderful noy&slong;e / in brennynge\ntunges / vpon an hundred and twenty di&slong;ciples gedered that tyme to gideres / and filled hem with all\nioye / vertues / and grace: by vertue wherof the di&slong;ciples\n&slong;trengthed / tau&yogh;te / li&yogh;tned / and enflawmed / &yogh;eden after\nby alle partes of the worlde and made it &slong;uget to hem in\ngreet partie. \u00b6 This is a worthy fe&slong;te\u00b7 and this is / among othere /\na &slong;wete and a louely fe&slong;te\u00b7 for this is the fe&slong;te of hym that\nis loue propurly / as &slong;eynt Gregorie &slong;eith / that the holy\ngoo&slong;t is loue.
