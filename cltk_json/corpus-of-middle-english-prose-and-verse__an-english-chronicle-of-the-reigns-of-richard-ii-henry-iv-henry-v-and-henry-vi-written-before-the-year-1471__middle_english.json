Thanne wente the king in to the tour of Londoun, and baar out therof alle the precious iewelx that his predecessours hadde put there to be kept; and among othir thyngis, he fond there an egle of gold, Nota de aquila aurea. and withynne the egle a violle of stoone closid, with a writyng aboute; the whiche writyng saide that our lady delyuerid that egle and the violle to Saint Thomas of Cauntirbury while&yogh; he was exilid, and saide to him that with the oille that was in the violle, the gode kyngis of Englond that sholde come aftirward sholde be ennoynted; and on of tho kyngis sholde gete agayn alle the lond that his aunces|tris hadde lost, withoute strengthe; and he sholde be grettist of alle kyngis, and he sholde bilde meny chirchis in the holi lond, and sholde driue alle the paynemes out of Babiloun, and there he shal make meny chirchis, and as ofte as he berith the said egle on his brest he shal haue the victory of his enemie&yogh;, and his kyngdom shall evir encrece; and this oynement shalle be founde in couenable tyme: and this egle baar king Richard alwey aboute his necke. Thanne made the kyng his testament fulle greuous and preiudi|ciall to the reme, as thay saide that saw it; and made ser Edmund of Langley, duke of York, lieutenaunt of Englond; and thanne wente he forth in to Yrlond. [May 31st.] He sailed from Milford Haven on the 29th of May, and landed at Waterford on the last of the month.", "18": "[Anno xxiij o .] A.D. 1399.

The duke of York that was lieutenaunt of Engelond wolde haue gon ayens thayme, but noman wolde folowe him; and ser William Scroope, tresorer of Englond, offrid men wonder large wage&yogh;, but he coude noman haue, for no money.

Walsingham (p. 441) says that Sigismund was installed Knight of the Garter on the Feast of St. George, having told us that he arrived in London on May 7th. This may seem strange, as St. George's day was on April 23rd. Fabyan perhaps explains this apparent contradiction, by saying that the celebration of the feast had been deferred on account of the Emperor. And sone aftir, cam the duke of Holond in to Englond, to speke with the emperour and with the kyng; \"Ante festum Ascensionis.\" (Wals.)

[A.D. 1460.?] Afterwarde this same yere, was holde a counseylle at West| A.D. 1458. mynstre aboute Shroftyde, to the whiche came the yong lordes [February.] whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys; that ys to sey, the duke of Somerset, the erle of Northumberlond, and his brother lord Egremount, and the lorde Clyfforde, with a grete power, and were loged withoute the walles of Londoun aboute Templebarre and Westmynstre. The cyte wolde nat receyue theym, because they came ageyns the pease. The duk of York and the erle of Sales|bury came but onely with theyre householde men in pesyble manner, thynkyng none harme, and were loged wythynne the cytee; for they abouesayde came forto dystroy vtterly the sayde duk of York and the erle of Salesbury, and of Warrewyk; and the cyte was euery day armed forto withstonde the malice of tho yong lordes yef nede had be. And sone after came the erle of Warrewyk fro Caleys, wherof he was capteyne, and lay wythynne the cyte. Thanne the byshoppys and other lordes tretyd betwyxt theym of the pease and accorde, and after long trete bothe partyes submytted theym to the laude and arbytrement of the kyng and his counselle. The whiche after good deliberacione and avysement yaf this awarde and arbitrement; that xlv. li . of yerely rente shulde be amorteysed and founded in for euermore by the sayde duk of York and the erles, in the abbey of Seynt Albons, where the forseyde lordes so slayne were buryed, for to pray for theyre soules and for the soules of alle tho that were slayne there. And ouer this the sayde duk of York and the erles shulde pay to the duke of Somerset and to hys \n  moder, to the erle of Northumbrelond, to the lorde Egremont and to the lorde Clyfford, a notable summe of money, for recompens of theyre fadres dethe, and for wronges done vnto theym. Where uppon was made wrytyng and suerte; and so was the trowble ceased, and pease and accorde made betwene theym; but hit endured nat long. One of the causes of this trouble betwene the duk of York and the duk of Somerset was thys\u2014Duryng the kynges sykenesse the duk of York was made protector of Englond, whereof the duk of [April 3, 1454.] Somerset had grete indignacioun and alwey malygned ayenst hym and stered the kyng ageyne hym; natheles meny of the lordes of the counceyl fauored more the duk of York thanne hym. Where|fore for certeyne causes and articles that were leyde ayenst the seyde duk of Somerset, he was commytted by the kynges counselle [Nov. 1453.] to the toure of London: but be instaunce and mediacione of his frendes he was sone delyuered, vnder this condicione, that he shulde neuer after entremete, ne have a do with the gouernaunce of the reame, and that he sholde nat come nyghe the kyng by xx. myle. And for to obserue and kepe these condicions he was swore vppon a book. Whenne he was delyuered oute of the toure, he took more vppon [Feb. 7, 1455.] hym thenne he dyd before, stiryng the kyng dayly and maliciously ageyns the forseyde duke of York and erles, coniectyng and yma|ginyng howe he myghte dystroy theyme; but at seynt Albonys he fylle in to the same snare that he had ordeyned for theyme.", "35": "[Anno] xxxvij.

And suche ymposiciones as were put to the peple, as taxes, tallages, and quyn&yogh;ymes, alle that came from theym was spended on vayne, for he helde no householde ne meyntened no warres. For these mys|gouernaunces, and for many other, the hertes of the peple were turned away from thayme that had the londe in gouernance, and theyre blyssyng was turnyd in to cursyng. The quene with such as were of her affynyte rewled the reame as her lyked, gaderyng ryches innumerable.

Whanne thys was done the erle of Wylshyre went to Southamp|toun, and there vnder colore for to take the erle of Warrewyk, but specyally for to stele priuyly owte of the reame as hit preued after|wardes, he armed and vytayled v. grete carrakys of Jene that were at that tyme in the port of the sayde toune, and stuffed theym with sowdyers of Englysshemen, takyng vytayle of the kynges pryce without payment, as he sholde haue made a vyage for the kyng, and put a grete parte of his tresoure in to the sayde carrake&yogh;; and sone after he past owte of the port and sayled aboute in the see, dredyng alwey the commyng of the forseyde erles of Warrewyk and Salesbury, and atte laste arryued in Ducheland, and sent hys sowdyers in to Englond ayene. Thanne were the kynges pryue seales dyrect to alle manner of bysshops, abbotys, pryores, and to alle the grete men of the spiri|tuelte and temporalte, for to leue the kyng money withoute delay for to wage men to kepe the see costes, that the sayde erles shuld nat arryue in no syde: and the sayde erle of Wylshyre made promys to alle suche persones as lent the kyng any money, that they shulde haue assignementes and repayment of the goodes of the forseyde duk of York and erles, whom they called oponne traytours. And the seyde erle of Wylshyre taxed the summe what euery man shuld leue, and so he made leve of many grete summes. And ouer thys, \n  proclamacione was made by commaundement of the kyng, that euery cyte, toune, and burghe, and hundredys, shuld fynde certayne sowdyers of thayre owne coste to kepe the see costys, for drede of landyng of the seyde erles. Ferthermore, the commones of Kent, dredyng the malyce and the tyranny of the forseyde erlle of Wylshyre and of other, lest he wolde exercyse his vengeaunce vppon thaym, as he had done vppon thaym at Newbery, and sent priuyly messagers and letters to Caleys to the forseyde erles, besechyng thaym that they wolde in alle haste possible come and socour thaym fro theyre enemyes, promyttyng that they wolde assyste theym with alle thayre power. The sayde erles wold nat anone yeue credence to theyre wrytyng and wordes, but send ouer in to Kent the lord Fauconbrege, to know whether theyre promys and theyre dedes sholde accorde: and anone the peple of Kent and of other shyres aboute resorted to the sayde lorde Fauconbrege in grete nombre, abydyng the commyng of the erles.

To the ryghte Worshypfulle Cyte of Caunterbury. Thanne the noble erles of Marche, Warrewyk, and Salysbury, Howe the Erles landed at Sand|wyche. hauyng wynde and weder at thayre plesaunce, arryued graciously at Sandwyche; where met wythe thaym master Thomas Bourchier archebysshop of Caunterbury, and a grete multitude of peple wythe hym; and wythe hys crosse before hym, [he] went forthe wythe the sayde erles and theyre peple toward Londoun, and sente an herowde to the cyte to knowe howe they were dysposed, and whether they wolde stand with theyme in thayre iust quarelle, and graunte hem leve for to passe thoroughe the cite. They that were nat frendely to the erles, counseyled the mayre and the comynalte for to ley gunne&yogh; at the brege for to kepe thaym owte, and so a lytelle diuision there was among the cite&yogh;ens, but yt was sone ceased. Than sent thay of the cyte to the sayde erles xij. worshypfulle and dyscrete aldermen, the whyche, in the name of alle the cyte, graunted thaym fre entre wythe suche seruyce as they cowde and myghte do to thayr worshyppe and honoure. Thys done, the alder|men retorned to the cyte, and the sayde herowde ageyne to the lordes. And the secund day of Juylle thay entred in to Londoun. And 2 of July, 1460. By the hand of Stowe. wythe theym came the popys legat, that nat long before had be in Englond; the whyche had auctoryte by the popes bulles for to entrete pease betwene the kyng and the erles, yt ( sic ) nede were; but, how yt were, he vsurped and toke oponne hym more power thanne he had, as it was knowenne afterward. Thanne was a conuocacione of the clergy holden at Paulys in Londoun, and theder came the sayde erles: and the erle of Warre|wyk there purposed, and recyted before alle the conuocacione, and innumerable peple standyng aboute, the causes of theyre commyng in to thys lond; and mysrewle and myscheues therof; and how with grete vyolence thay had be repeled and put from the kynges presence, that they myghte nat come to hys hyghenes forto excuse thaym of suche fals accusaciones as were layde ayens thaym; and now were come ayene, by Goddys mercy, accompanyed with peple for to come to hys presens, there to declare and excuse thayre inno|cence, or ellys to dy in the felde; and there [they] made an open othe vpponne the cros of Caunterbury that thay had euer bore trew feythe and lygeaunce to the kynges persone, wyllyng no more hurt to hym than to thayre owen personnes; wherof they took God and hys moder and alle the sayntes of heuene to wyttenesse. The kyng, that held a counseylle at Couentre, heryng of the commyng of the erles, went to Northamptone. The erle of Salesbury be comyn assent of the cite was maad rewler and gouernour of Londoun, in absence of the forseyde erles. And the seyde erles of Marche and Warrewyk and other lordes, that ys to say the lorde Facombrege, lorde Clyntone, lorde Bourser, prioure of Seynt Johannes, lorde Audeley, lorde Bergevenny, lord Say, lord Scroope, tharchebysshoppe of Caunterbury, the popes legat, the bysshoppe of Excetre, the bysshops of Ely, Salesbury, and Rouches|tre, dressed hem forth to the kyng to Northamptone. The lord Scales and the lorde Hungreford that before the com|myng of the erles were in the cyte of London, wolde haue had the rewle and gouernaunce therof, but they of the cyte wold nat suffre thaym, for thay sayde that they were suffysaunt for to rewle the cyte thaymself; wherof the lordes hauyng indygnacione wente in to the toure of Londoun, and meny other grete men with theym, whos names bethe here vndre wretynne:\u2014lord Vessy, lord Louelle, lord Delaware, lord Kendale a Gascoyne, ser Edmond Hampden \n  knyghte, Thomas Broun knyghte, shireue of Kent, Johan Bruyn of Kent, ser Geruays Clyftone knyghte, tresorer of the kynges hows, ser Thomas Tyrelle knyghte, the duchesse of Exetre, and many other. And the toure was beseged by lond and by water, that no vytayl myghte come to thayme that were wythynne. Whanne the erles and lordes were gone to Northamptone, thay that were wythynne the toure caste wyld fyre in to the cyte, and shot in smale gonnes, and brend and hurte men and wymmen and chyldren in the stretes. And they of London leyde grete bom|bardes on the ferther syde of the Thamyse agayns the toure and crased the walles therof in diuerse places; natheles they hoped dayly forto haue be rescued, but alle was in veyne. The kyng at Northamptone lay atte Freres, and had ordeyned there a strong and a myghty feeld, in the medowys beside the Nonry, armed and arayed wythe gonnys, hauyng the ryuer at hys back. The erles with the nombre of lx. M l ., as it was sayd, came to Northamptone, and sent certayne bysshops to the kyng besechyng hym that in eschewyng of effusyone of Crysten blood he wolde admytte and suffre the erles for to come to his presence to declare thaym self as thay were. The duk of Bukynghame that stode besyde the kyng, sayde vn to thaym, \"Ye come nat as bysshoppes for to trete for pease, but as men of armes;\" because they broughte with thaym a notable company of men of armes. They answered and sayde, \"We come thus for suerte of oure persones, for they that bethe aboute the kyng bythe nat oure frendes.\" \"Forsothe,\" sayde the duk, \"the erle of Warrewyk shalle nat come to the kynges presence, and yef he come he shalle dye.\" The messyngers retorned agayne, and tolde thys to the erles. Thanne the erle of Warrewyk sent an herowde of armes to the kyng, besechyng that he myghte haue ostages of saaf goyng and commyng, and he wolde come naked to his presence, but he myghte nat be herde. And the iij de tyme he sente to the kyng and sayde \n  that at ij howres after none, he wolde speke with hym, or elles dye in the feeld. The archebysshoppe of Caunterbury sent a bysshoppe of this lond to the kyng with an instruccione, the whyche dyd nat hys message indyfferently, but exorted and coraged the kynges part for to fy&yogh;te, as thay sayde that were there. And another tyme he was sent to the kyng by the commones, and thanne he came nat ayene, but pryuely departed awey. The bysshop of Herforde, a Whyte Frere, the kynges confessoure, ded the same: wherfore after the batayle he was commytted to the castelle of Warrewyk, where he was long in pryson. Thanne on the Thurseday the x th day of Juylle, the yere of oure The bataylle of Northampton. Lorde M l .CCCC.lx, at ij howres after none, the sayde erles of Marche [July 10th.] and Warrewyk lete crye thoroughe the felde, that no man shuld laye hand vpponne the kyng ne on the commune peple, but onely on the lordes, knyghtes and squyers: thenne the trumpettes blew vp, and bothe hostes countred and faughte togedre half an oure. The lorde Gray, that was the kynges vawewarde, brake the feelde and came to the erles party, whyche caused sauacione of many a mannys lyfe: many were slayne, and many were fled, and were drouned in the ryuer. The duk of Bukyngham, the erle of Shrouesbury, the lorde Beaumont, the lorde Egremount were slayne by the Kentysshmen besyde the kynges tent, and meny other knyghtes and squyers. The ordenaunce of the kynges gonnes avayled nat, for that day was so grete rayne, that the gonnes lay depe in the water, and so were queynt and myghte nat be shott. Whanne the feld was do, and the erles thoroughe mercy and helpe had the vyctory, they came to the kyng in his tent, and sayde in thys wyse\u2014 \"Most Noble Prince, dysplease yow nat, thoughe it haue pleased God of His Grace to graunt vs the vyctory of oure mortalle enemyes, the whyche by theyre venymous malyce haue vntrewly \n  stered and moued youre hyghenesse to exyle vs oute of youre londe, and wolde vs haue put to fynalle shame and confusyone. We come nat to that entent for to inquyete ne greue youre sayde hyghenesse, but for to please youre moste noble personne, desiryng most tendrely the hyghe welfare and prosperyte thereof, and of alle youre reame, and for to be youre trew lyegemen, whyle oure lyfes shalle endure.\" The kyng of theyre wordes was gretely recomforted, and anone was lad in to Northamptone wythe processyone, where he rested hym iij dayes, and thanne came to London, the xvj day of the monethe [July 16th.] abouesayde, [and] loged in the bysshop's paleys. For the whyche vyctory London yaf to Almyghtye God grete lawde and thankyng. Nat longe before this batayle it was proclamed in Lancastreshyre and Chesshyre, that yef so were that the kyng had the vyctory of the erles, that thanne euery man shulde take what he myghte and make havok in the shyres of Kent, Essexe, Middylsexe, Surreye, Sussexe, Hamshyre and Wylshyre: bot God wolde nat suffre suche fals robbery. Furthermore the Saturday the xix day of Juylle, thay that were [July 19th.] in the toure of Londoun for lack of vytayl yolden vp the toure, and came oute: of the whyche afterward some were drawe and beheded. The lord Scales, for as meche as men of Londoun loued hym nat, he thoughte that he myghte haue stande in the more sewrte in the saintwary of Westmynstre thanne in the toure. Late in the euyn, [he] entred a boote with iij persones rowyng toward Westmynstre, and a wommanne the whiche that knewe hym ascryed hym, and anone the boote men gadered theym togedre and folowed hym, and fylle vpponne hym, and kylde hym and caste hym on the lond, besyde seynt Mary Ouerey. And grete pyte it was, that so noble and so worshypfulle a knyghte, and so welle approued in the warrys of Normandy and Fraunce, shuld dy so myscheuously. Whan quene Margarete harde telle, that the kyng was dyscom|fyted \n  and take, she fledde with hyr sone and viij persones in to the castelle of Hardlaghe in Wales, and as she went by Lancastreshyre, there she was robbed and dyspoyled of alle her goodes, to the valew of x.M l . marc., as yt was sayde; and sone after she went into Scotlonde.
