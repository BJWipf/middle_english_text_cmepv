OF FEIGNED CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE. I THINK this is an early work of Wyclif's. It is certainly higher in tone and better in style than many in this volume. Especially to be noticed is the passage on p. 193, where the author, after inveighing against the heavy burden of ritual ordinances laid upon priests, returns upon himself with the warning that men must not abuse the freedom to which he exhorts them by making it an excuse for sloth, for that is the devil's snare. So, too, the complaint (p.194) that priests lead a lower life than their conscience dictates, for fear of hurting the sick conscience of their brethren, is a touch finer than is common in these polemical papers. How often may Wyclif's impetuous exhortations to revolt have been parried by such considerations as these? The scribe who wrote the Corpus MS. (X.) made a curious blunder with this tract, as has been pointed out by Mr. Arnold, S. E. W. III. 507. Owing most likely to the displacement of some leaves in the MS. from which he copied, he transferred the last part of this tract to the end of \"A Petition to the King and Parliament,\" while bringing the last part of the Petition to the end of this. As is often the case with him, he passed over the junction in happy unconsciousness that he was writing nonsense. Copied from the Corpus MS. X. and collated with the Dublin MS. AA. SUMMARY.

THIS tract should be compared with that printed by Mr. Arnold (S. E. W. III. 98), to which it has many points of likeness. It is not improbable that Wyclif should have written more than one tract in explanation and praise of the Lord's Prayer, since he was never tired of opposing its excellence to the vanity of the church prayers of his day. There is nothing here which enables us to fix either date or author|ship with certainty, but I take the tract to be genuine from its close connexion with that which follows, as to which I have scarcely any doubt. The tract is found only in X. from which it has been copied. SUMMARY. The prayer is taken by petitions, each of which is explained, and to each is assigned some special virtue.

Amen.", "11": "XII. THE AVE MARIA. I HAVE no doubt of the genuineness of this tract. The tone and manner are Wyclif's, and the invective against the frivolity of the gentry suits better a man who had lived at court than one of the obscure poor preachers. Besides the general style there is one passage which bears a special mark of Wyclif. On page 208 we are told, \"God the Trinity is with each creature . . . to keep it; for else it should turn to naught.\" The belief of the immanence of God in all created things is one which Wyclif held firmly. (Cf. Cum ergo in qualibet creatura est Trinitas increata.\u2014Trial, iv. 27.) The doctrine was brought into popular use in his latest controversies on the Eucharist, but used as it is here, in a different connexion and in|cidentally, it is a sign of the hand of the master rather than one of his pupils.

It is simply an enumeration of the faults charged against the religious orders, thrown into the form of a wish that they may be avoided. The special points for notice are the mention of astronomy among the subjects taught in the religious schools (No. 39), and the complaint that the friars were \"too homely with gentlewomen by colour of physic\" (No. 38), (cf. Prof. Brewer's preface to Monumenta Franciscana, pp. xliii-xlvi). The same charge is made in the tract Of the Leaven of Pharisees. The abuse of bishoprics in partibus infidelium conferred on men who only desire episcopal orders for the profit to be made of them at home (No. 40) is, I think, mentioned nowhere else in this volume. It is attacked in the Great Sentence of Curse (S.E.W. III. 300). We may see from No. 42 the kind of retort made by the friars on the poor preachers. The only indication of date is in No. 26, where we learn that one of the points of the poor preachers was the application of the prophecies of Antichrist to the Pope. The preachers are not likely to have begun with arguments of this kind. Still we cannot lay much stress on this argument; such use of prophecy had long been familiar to the Fraticelli.

It was written soon after the Wat Tyler riots, when Wyclif and his followers were discredited by a supposed complicity with John Ball (cf. Wals. II. 33). The indignant disclaiming of Socialist doctrine is fearlessly combined with denunciation of the oppressions committed by the rich. The complaint that \"lords strive with their tenants to bring them into thraldom more than they should by reason and charity\" (p. 234), is a proof, if one were needed, of the kind of in|justice which led to the revolt. The author had lived among the poor and been an eye-witness of oppression, or he would not have insisted with such force on the need of the lord's presence to control the extortions of his steward (p. 240), nor should we have had the touch of the white (tally) sticks, which the poor were made to accept for their goods (p. 233).

It is a summary of the wishes of the writer as to reform in Church and State; the first thirteen points of the poor priests relating to the clergy, and the eighteen which follow (and which might almost be taken as a separate tract), having reference to the duties of secular rulers. I am inclined to date it 1377. The first year of a new reign would be a suitable time for the issue of a programme such as this; and there is a stronger ground for the supposition in the correspondence of several 'points' with petitions of the Commons in Richard's first Parliament. The tract certainly belongs to the fourteenth century. The desire that no priest or religious should be prisoned without open doom (p. 279) marks a time when no Act of Parliament had sanctioned the burning of heretics, but when the bishops, alarmed at the spread of heresy, were taking the law into their own hands. I can give no decided opinion as authorship, but all the points are within the scope of Wyclif's teaching. The tract is to be found only in the Corpus MS. X.

Amen.", "2": "Explicit tractatus de pseudo freris."}}, "22": "XXIII. OF CONFESSION. DR. SHIRLEY says that this tract is the same as the Latin De Eucharistia et P\u0153nitentia. The latter is found only at Vienna, and I have not been able to compare the two. I have, however, no doubt that this is genuine. Its presence in the Ashburnham MS. tells much in its favour, while the evidence of style seems to me to mark it as decidedly Wyclif's. His predestinarian doctrines are incidentally referred to on p. 329: \"who is he \u00feat letti\u00fe god to saue men as he ha\u00fe ordeyned . . . before \u00fee world was made?\" There are curious notices on pp. 333 and 335 of the prevalent fashion of keeping private confessors and of the influence which such men wielded. The attack on transubstantiation at the end of the tract shows it to be late. Copied from the Dublin MS. CC, and collated with the Ashburnham MS. MM. SUMMARY. Two virtues are in man's soul: holiness and knowledge. Holiness is the more important. To holiness confession is needful. Definition of confession. Con|fession of sin is made to God or to man. The latter may be either open or private, but must be voluntary p. 327 Private confession is unnecessary, unauthorized by Christ or by the practice of the early Church. It is a device to increase the power of the Pope 328 It is limiting God's power to say a man cannot be saved without shrift. Private confession gives occasion to sin 329 Possible abuses from the law of regular confession. The proper priest may be unfit. Confession hinders preaching 330 The methods of absolution vary. Some seem to claim fellowship with God for the priest. Arbitrary assignment of penance. Leads to buying sin for money 332 The devil wishes all men to believe that priests only have power to absolve, and the four orders of friars unite to maintain this. Evil of private confessors 334 It would be well to have two priests to hear penance, as it would prevent mischief and increase wholesome shame. Some confessions would be better divulged p. 335 Confession has done much good and much harm. It should not be obligatory. None of the confessors are equal to the task they undertake. General and open confession sufficient 336 All sin is offence against God 337 Need of sorrow for sin. God's free grace a reason for avoiding sin 338 Antichrist argues that without the outward sign of shrift the sacrament of penance is destroyed 339 God's courtesy does not in all cases require audible confession, and all good deeds may be called sacraments 340 The keys given to St. Peter are knowledge and power, which were given also to the other apostles. The knowledge is knowledge of God's law, the power is that of preaching and teaching 341 Antichrist cites the ten lepers that Christ bid show themselves to the priest 342 It was Christ that healed them; and we should follow the Samaritan's example and thank Christ for forgiveness 343 Arguments of Antichrist from James v. 16; from the raising of Lazarus; and from John's baptism, shown not to bear on private confession to priests 343 Exhortation to priests to attend to preaching and to avoid claiming to perform miracles in the transubstantiation of the Host 345 Nota de Confessione. Two virtues ben in mannes soule by whyche a man shuld be rewled; CC inserts in. hoolynesse in mannes wille, & good kunnyng in his witt. hoolynesse shuld put out synne, & good \u00feis MM. kunnyng shuld put out foly; but as wille ha\u00fe principalite to-fore witt of mannes soule, so hoolynesse is more wor\u00fee \u00feenne is kunnynge of synful man. for wuckud aungels han myche kunnyng, but \u00feei han nou&yogh;t of hoolynesse.

DE SACRAMENTO ALTARIS. IN this little tract Wyclif sums up the difference between his teaching on the Eucharist and that of the friars. It is curious to see him taking up the position of a loyal son of the Church, and complaining that his adversaries accuse the Pope and the Court of Rome of heresy. As the tract is evidently a fragment, it may be that in the larger piece from which it was taken he had alleged some utterance of the Roman see in his favour; perhaps the oath of Berengarius, to which he often appealed, although his opponents might have cited it on their side with at least equal confidence.

For \u00feai hadden noone o\u00feer possesyon amonge \u00fee o\u00feer peple, ne eny schuld haue. So \u00feat goddis parte was \u00feus assignyd to \u00fee trybe or kynrede of leuy; of \u00fee whiche kynrede wern goddis prestis in \u00fee old lawe, and of noone o\u00feere. And \u00feis ordynance of god as tochynge \u00fee liflode of prestis was kept ful streytly, so fer for\u00fee \u00feat \u00feo \u00feingis \u00feat wer offrid to god in \u00fee temple by deuocyon of \u00fee peple, \u00fee whiche wer not by \u00fee lawe of god expresly assigned to the kynrede of leuy, weren kept fro \u00fee use of \u00feat kynrede to \u00fee comon profete of alle \u00fee peple; as to \u00fee 4 Kings xii. [4-15] and xxii. [4-7.] repaire of \u00fee temple, and to rawnson \u00fee kynge and \u00fee rewme at nede, as scripture beri\u00fe witnesse in the tyme of goode kyngis Joas & Josias. For si\u00fe god had assigned lyflode to \u00fee kynrede of leuy aftir his owne witte, and he may not be fawty in his worchinge or ordenance, it had ben a dampnable presumpcion for to haue ordend more lijflode to hem. And not-wi\u00festondinge \u00feat kynge dauyd, purposynge to encrese \u00fee worschip of god in his peple, ordend syngers and players in dyuers musical instrumentis to serue byfore god in \u00fee temple; &yogh;it presumyd he not to take eny \u00feinge \u00feat god had assigned to \u00fee temporall parte of his peple, and endowe wi\u00fe siche goodis \u00fees mynystres of \u00fee temple; but he chese \u00fees men of \u00fee tribe or kynrede of leuy and lett hem lyue on her owne parte, and so kept \u00fee temporalte hoole wi\u00fe-owte eny peyr|ynge \u00feerof. And salamon his sonne, the wisest kynge \u00feat euer was, dide \u00fee same. And si\u00fe kynge dauid, \u00fee chosen of god aftir his owne herte & full of \u00fee spirite of prophecye, and salamon his wise sonne also, durste not chawnge \u00fee ordenance of \u00fee goodis mouable and vnmouable, \u00fee whiche god had by|take to her gouernance, and make prestis ryche, as \u00feou&yogh; god had not sufficiently ordend for hem in his lawe. And wi\u00fe \u00feis, not-wi\u00festondynge \u00feat kynge dauyd was so fulle of vertuous and kyngly condycions \u00feat he is sett in scripture as \n  a patrone & ensaumple of alle goode kyngis, how dar oure kyngis, \u00feat han not \u00fees &yogh;iftis of god, so expresly a&yogh;ens goddis lawe, \u00fee olde and \u00fee newe, presume to ouerturne all the gloriouse ordinance of god a-bowte siche temporaltes, and make the state of presthode lordis a&yogh;ens \u00fee lyfe and \u00fee lore of criste and his apostles, and a&yogh;ens \u00fee proces of \u00fee olde lawe in \u00feis poynte, confermyd bi \u00fee newe? In whiche he ha\u00fe so openly, in worde, dede, and in ensaumple, tau&yogh;te and commaundit hem \u00feat \u00feai schuld not be lordis so. And understonde \u00feu here, \u00feat whan \u00feer is eny \u00feinge dampned of god in \u00fee olde lawe, if \u00fee same be dampnyd in \u00fee newe, alle \u00fee euydence \u00feat ben a&yogh;en syche a defawte in \u00fee olde lawe ben euen a&yogh;ens \u00fee same in \u00fee newe. And so all \u00fee lawis \u00feat god &yogh;aue by moyses a&yogh;ens \u00fee worldly lordeschip of prestis of \u00fee olde lawe be euen a&yogh;ens \u00feis, \u00feat prestis schulde be lordis so in \u00fee newe lawe. Si\u00fe \u00feat moyses lawe is moralle in \u00feis poynte, \u00feat longe\u00fe to \u00fee perfeccyon of presthode, criste my&yogh;te not distroy \u00fees lawis nei\u00feer dispens wi\u00fe hem, \u00feat prestis schulden not now be bunden to \u00fees lawis. And si\u00fe criste and his colage my&yogh;t not be dispensid wi\u00fe ne be exempte fro \u00fee bondis of \u00fee olde lawe in \u00feis mater, I merueyle wher \u00fee pryuelegis commen alonde wherby owre colagis of monkis, chanons or eny o\u00feer endowid prestis \u00feat dwellen in siche conventycles claymen to be exempt fro \u00feis bonde of \u00fee olde lawe in this poynte, \u00feat in so many placis so opynly forfendi\u00fe hem siche lordeschip; for \u00feus it is writen: \"Dixit Num. xviii.

And aftir \u00fees gracis \u00feus minystred by \u00fees two prestis, Naaman proferid to heli&yogh;e wondir grete &yogh;iftis of mouable goodis, and constantyne proferid to siluestre bo\u00fee mouable & vnmouable goodis in wondir grete plente and excesse.

But siluestir did on \u00fee contrari wise; for whan he was sow&yogh;te to passion, he hidde hym sijlfe, as \u00fee storie of John xviii. [4.] hym telli\u00fe. And whan he was callid to \u00fee state of \u00fee emperoure or worldly dignite, he in a maner proferid hym self; in als myche as he manly wi\u00festode not \u00fee hidous & synfulle purpose of \u00fee emperoure, but cowerdly consentid to his foly.

Ergo tu et tibi usurpare audes aut dominans apostolatum, aut apostolicus apostolatus MS. dominatum. Plane ab alterutro prohiberis. Si utrumque simul habere velis, perdis utrumque. Alioquin non te exceptum putes de illo numero, de quibus sic conqueritur deus, Osee octavo: Ipsi Hosea [viii. 4.] regnauerunt sed non ex me. At si interdictum tenemus, audiamus edictum. luce xxii. Qui maior est vestrum, ait, Luke [xxii. 26.] fiat sicut iunior, et qui precessor est sicut qui ministrat. fforma apostolica hec est; Dominacio interdicitur, indicitur ministracio. hec ibi. Item, Origenes super gen. omelia xvi o . Denique vis scire quid intersit inter sacerdotes domini et sacerdotes pharaonis. Pharao terras concedit sacerdotibus suis, dominus autem sacerdotibus suis partem non concedit in terra, sed dicit eis: Ego pars vestra. Obseruate ergo qui hec legitis, omnes domini sacerdotes, et videte que sit differencia sacerdotum, ne forte qui partem habent in terra, \n  et terrenis cultibus ac studijs vacant, non tam domini quam pharaonis sacerdotes esse videantur. Ille enim est qui vult sacerdotes suos habere possessiones, et exercere agri non anime culturam, Ruri sed non legi operam dare. Christus autem, dominus noster, sacerdotibus suis quid precipit audiamus: Qui non, inquit, renunciauerit omnibus que possidet, non potest meus esse discipulus. Negat christus suum esse discipulum quem viderit aliquid possidentem, et eum qui non renunciat omnibus que possidet. Et quid agimus? qui hec aut ipsi legimus, aut populis exponimus, qui non solum non renunciamus hijs que possidemus, sed & adquirere volumus ea que nunquam habuimus antequam veniremus ad papatum. 'Christum' Origen. &c a . per processum. Item, parysiensis libro de vicijs, titulo de auaricia mercenariorum: Sciebat dominus oculum ecclesie impediendum esse temporalibus istis ab officio suo; Modicum enim pulueris vel palee oculum omnino cessare facit ab officio suo. Immo voluit duces ecclesie pauperes esse, eo quod paupertas expedita est, sicut seneca dicit, et subdit: Si vis omnino vacare ut pauper sis, ora ut pauperi sis similis. Et si cetera membra corporis ad plura officia conueniant, ut lingua ad gustum et loquelam, et manus ad multa similiter, oculus tantum vnum habet, et contactum terre maxime timet. Sic oculus ecclesie con|templatiuus legi diuine debuit intendere, et a terrenis istis seperari. licet pes hominis a ceteris membris eius seperatus non sit, tamen habet seperatam artem que ei deseruit, & artifices qui ei totaliter circa calciamenta eius intenti sunt. Quanto magis debent esse aliqui qui totaliter spiritualibus sint intenti. Sed hodie magis occupata est ecclesia in temporalibus, quo ad magnam partem suam, quam fuerat sinagoga. vnde quum fuit datum a constantino imperium occidentali ecclesie, facta est vox de celo, dicens: hodie infusum est venenum ecclesie dei. hec ille. Item Odo in sermone, Estote misericordes: Stercora putredinis sunt diuicie, \n  quibus volucres celi, i. demones, excecant oculos cupidorum. Et bene dicuntur diuicie stercora demonum, quum omnes diuicias reputant tanquam stercora, nec querunt nisi animam, vnde diues quum moritur quasi in tres porciones diuiditur; mundus rapit diuicias, vermes cadauer, et demones animam. Et quilibet contentus sua porcione alterius partem non desiderat; vnde versus: Spiritus est sathane, caro vermis, mammona mundi; Vnica plus duplici pars sua cuique cuilibet MS. placet. Item non tantum a demonibus sed a perfectis diuicie stercora reputantur; vnde apostolus: Omnia reputaui tamquam [Phil. iii. 8.] stercora ut christum lucrifacerem. Pro hijs stercoribus causidici clamant in foro; clerici quoque cantant in choro; medici cum egrotis vigilant in thalamo. Pro hijs stercoribus frequenter illicita committuntur in mundo. Sequitur: pocius cum thobia gaudeamus, qui, curata cecitate quam per stercora contraxerat, visum recuperauit. Sic cum diuicie auferuntur oculum iusticie recuperamus. Cum gladius furioso aufertur, sanitate restituta, gracias refert illi qui abstulit. Similiter si dolemus pro ablacione temporalium, quibus excecamur, quibus interficimur, furiosi sumus. Et reddita nobis dis|crecione, saltem in alia vita, illi qui nobis stercora ab oculis nostris extersit, illi qui gladium abstulit gracias referemus. Alibi appellantur venenum; vnde eodem die quo a constantino dotata est ecclesia, in aere audita est vox angelica, dicens; hodie infusum est venenum in ecclesia; maior quidem effecta est in dignitate, sed minor religione. Item Odo in sermone Ecce nos reliquimus omnia: Abel moritur i. cura pastoralis, luctus spiritualis interimitur, set caym, i. possessio, conser|uatur; ymmo pastor animarum caym agricola efficitur. Non enim in ecclesia queritur si sciat bene docere, pro peccatis lugere, set si sit caym, i. agricola; si sciat terras bene colere. Nec mirum si multos interficit possessio, cum sit venenum; \n  vnde eodem die quo dotata est ecclesia a constantino audita est vox in aere: hodie infusum est venenum in ecclesia; maior quidem dignitate, set minor religione. Si queritur: vbi est ouis tibi commissa? respondet: Numquid custos fratris mei sum? quasi, Que cura est mihi de animabus, dummodo disponatur bene de temporalibus. Tales sicut caim sunt maledicti qui educunt ouem abel, et non reducunt, set seducunt. vnde Ezechiel: Pastores eorum seduxerunt eos. Item Gorham super illo Apoc. xii o : Misit serpens ex ore suo post mulierem aquam tanquam flumen, &c. Per aquam fluminis significatur abundancia temporalis, que fluit cotidie sicut aqua. vnde psalmista: diuicie si affluant, nolite cor apponere. hanc aquam habundantissime misit draco in ecclesiam dei, domino permittente, quum a constantino datum est imperium occidentali ecclesie; vnde tunc audita est vox angelorum anglorum MS. in aere dicencium: hodie infusum est venenum in ecclesia dei; sicut legitur in apocrifo Siluestri. Et quia iam appropinquat venenum hoc ad cor ecclesie, ita ut iam sit suffocacio proxima, clamat ipsa ecclesia cum psalmista: Saluum me fac, deus, quoniam intrauerunt aque usque ad animam meam. Et deus de sua bonitate nunc primo incipit audire ecclesiam suam, et misit adiutorem suum, scilicet terram, que absorbere vult totum flumen; vel principem terrenum, qui vult auferre ab ecclesia omnia temporalia sua, licet intencio non eadem sit cum domino, qui propter bonum ecclesie mittit illum ex misericordia. hec ille. Item Jeronymus in vitis patrum: Ecclesia ex quo creuit in possessionibus, decreuit in virtutibus. Item Jeronimus ad ne pocianum ep. xxxiiii: Aut aurum repudiemus nos, sc. clerici, cum ceteris supersticionibus iudeorum, aut si aurum placeat, placeant et iudei, quos cum auro aut probare necesse est nobis aut dampnare. Item Jeronymus ad nepocianum: Clericus qui christi seruit ecclesie primo interpretetur vocab[u]lum suum, et nominis diffinicione prolata, nitatur esse quod dicitur. Si enim cleros grece latine \n  sors appellatur, propterea clerici dicuntur quia de sorte sunt domini, vel quia dominus ipse sors, i. pars, clericorum est. Et quia et ipse pars domini est, et dominum partem habet, talem se exhibere debet, ut ipse possideat dominum et possideatur a domino. Qui enim dominum possidet, et cum propheta dicit: pars mea dominus, nichil extra dominum possidere potest; nam si quippiam aliud habuerit preter dominum, pars eius non erit dominus. verbi gracia, si aurum, si argentum, si possessionem, si variam suppellectilem habuerit, cum istis partibus dominus pars eius fieri non dignatur. Et paulo post: habens victum et vestitum hijs contentus ero, et nudus nudam crucem sequar. Obsecro te itaque repetens, iterum iterumque monebo, ne officium clericatus genus antique milicie puteo, ne lucrum seculi in christi queras milicia, ne plus habeas quam quando clericus esse cepisti. Here suen autorites in latyn of holy scripture and doctouris a&yogh;ens seculeris office of prestis. pAulus apostolus dicit ij thi. ij o ad excludendum prelatos [2 Tim. ii. 4.] et sacerdotes ab omni seculari officio isto modo: Nemo militans deo implicat se negocijs secularibus, ut ei placeat cui se probauit. Iste autem textus breuis et compendiosus apostoli, ex fide quam importat, excluderet omnes sacerdotes et pure clericos ab omni officio seculari. Quum seculare officium est destructiuum cure pastoralis. Immo ex canone apostolorum dicitur: Episcopus aut sacerdos aut diaconus nequaquam lxxxviij. de cap o . Eps. seculares curas assumant. Sin autem assumpserint deiciantur; quia, ut dicit gregorius ibidem, Inutile et valde laboriosum est hominem litteratum raciocinacionum causas assumere, et in eis que non expedit se obligare. Item, ibidem dicit beatus ciprianus, cap o neque: In dispensacione ecclesie hanc regulam obseruandam nouerit unusquisque, ut nulli quantumlibet exercitate persone duo simul officia committat. Immo nomine sacerdotis careat qui dei ministros a suis evocet officiis. Et idem Ciprianus dicit quod ministri ecclesie debent solum \n  altari et sacrificiis deseruire, et precibus, studijs et oracionibus vacare. Et si quis eos a spirituali officio ad seculare duxeret, non offeretur pro eo oblacio, nec sacrificium pro sepultura eius celebrabitur; non enim ante altare dei merentur nominari in sacerdotum prece qui sacerdotes et ministros ecclesie ab altari volunt avocare. Immo dicit beatus Augustinus: ffornicari hominibus nunquam licet, negociari autem aliquibus lxxxviij. de c o . ffornicari. licet, aliis non licet. Antequam enim ecclesiasticus quis sit, licet ei negociari; facto ecclesiastico iam non licet. Item ibidem scribitur sic: Tuicionem testamentorum episcopus non suscipiat. episcopus nullam rei familiaris curam ad se reuocet, set leccioni et oracioni et verbo predicacionis tantummodo vacet. Item beatus petrus in epistola ad clementem dicit xi. q. 1 o . c o . Sicut enim impietatis est crimen tibi, o clemens, neglectis verbi dei studijs sollicitudines seculares suscipere, ita vnicuique laicorum peccatum est nisi inuicem sibi ecclesiam in hijs que ad communis vsum vite pertinent operam fideliter dederint. Ideo concludit lex canonica apostolorum statuta sunt que dicunt: Nemo militans deo implicat se &c a . Proinde aut xi. q. iij. co. Credo. clerici sint sine accionibus dominorum aut actores sine officio clericorum. Et uniuersi dixerunt; hec obseruemus. Item ibidem sic scribitur hij qui in ecclesia domini ad ordinem promouentur clericorum, in nullo ab administracione diuina auocentur, nec molestiis et negociis secularibus alligentur ut ab altaribus & sacrificijs recedant; set die ac nocte celestibus rebus et spiritualibus seruiant Item beatus petrus in epistola ad clementem sic scribit: Te quidem oportet irreprehensibilem xi. q. 1 o . c o Te quidem. viuere, et summo studio niti ut omnes vite huius occupaciones abicias. Non fide-iussor existas nec aduocatus licium fias, ne in ulla occupacione prorsus inueniaris mundialis negocii occasione perplexus. Neque enim iudicem neque cognitorem secularium negociacionum te ordinare vult christus, ne pre|focatus presentibus hominum curis, non possis verbo dei vacare. Hec vero opera que minus tibi congruere diximus exhibeant sibi inuicem vacantes laici, et te nemo occupet ab hijs studijs per que salus datur hominibus &c a . Item \n  gregorius Romano defensori: perlatum est, inquit, ad nos [Decreti pars la. Dist. lxxxviii. cap. 4.] reuerendissimum fratrem nostrum, basilium episcopum, velut vnum de laicis in causis secularibus occupari, et pretorijs inutiliter obseruire; que res quidem et ipsum vilem reddit, et reuerentiam sacerdotalem adnichilat. statim ut experiencia tua hoc preceptum susceperit, ad reuertendum eum districta executione compellat, Quatenus te illic consistente quinque diebus sub qualibet excusatione immorari non liceat. Ne si quolibet modo eum ibidem amplius moram habere permiseris, cum ipso apud nos grauiter incipias esse culpabilis, &c. Ista ad presens sufficiunt cum diligenti scripturarum excercitatione ad excitandum sacerdotes ne curis secularibus se subiciant; set oracioni, studio et predicacioni intendant, et sic, spiritualibus inimicis deuictis, soli deo placere studeant; ut cum ipso in celestibus regnare valeant; prestante domino nostro ihesu christo, qui cum patre et spiritu sancto vivit & regnat deus.
