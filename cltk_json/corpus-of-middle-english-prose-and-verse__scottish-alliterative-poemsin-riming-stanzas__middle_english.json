IN the tyme of Arthur, as trew men me tald, The king turnit on ane tyde towart Tuskane, Hym to seik our the sey, that saiklese wes sald, The syre that sendis all seill, suthly to sane; With banrentis, barounis, and bernis full bald, Biggast of bane and blude bred in Britane. Thai walit out werryouris with wapinnis to wald, The gayest grumys on grund, with geir that myght gane; Dukis and digne lordis, douchty and deir, Sembillit to his summovne, Renkis of grete renovne, Cumly kingis with crovne Of gold that wes cleir. II. Thus the royale can remove, with his Round Tabill, Of all riches maist rike, in riall array. Wes neuer fundun on fold, but fen&yogh;eing or fabill, Ane farayr floure on ane feild of fresch men, in fay; Farand on thair stedis, stout men and stabill, Mony sterne our the streit stertis on stray. Thair baneris schane with the sone, of siluer and sabill, And vthir glemyt as gold and gowlis so gay; Of siluer and saphir schirly thai schane; Ane fair battell on breid, Merkit our ane fair meid; With spurris spedely thai speid Our fellis, in fane. III. The king faris with his folk, our firthis and fellis, Feill dais or he fand of flynd or of fyre; Bot deip dalis bedene, dovnis and dellis, Montains and marresse, with mony rank myre; Birkin bewis about, boggis and wellis, With outin beilding of blis, of bern or of byre; Bot torris and tene wais, teirfull quha tellis. Tuglit and travalit thus trew men can tyre, Sa wundir wait wes the way, wit ye but wene; And all thair vittalis war gone, That thay weildit in wone; Resset couth thai find none That suld thair bute bene. IV. As thay walkit be the syde of ane fair well, Throu the schynyng of the son ane ciete thai se, With torris and turatis, teirfull to tell, Bigly batollit about with wallis sa he. The yettis war clenely kepit with ane castell; Myght none fang it with force, bot foullis to fle. Than carpit king Arthur, kene and cruell: \"I rede we send furth ane saynd to yone ciete, ane send, in the original edition . And ask leif at the lord, yone landis suld leid, That we myght entir in his toune, For his hie renoune, To by vs vittale boune, For money to meid.\" V. Schir Kay carpit to the king, courtes and cleir: \"Grant me, lord, on yone gait graithly to gay; And I sall boid-word, but abaid, bring to you heir, Gif he be freik on the fold your freynd or your fay.\" \"Sen thi will is to wend, wy, now in weir, Luke that wisly thow wirk, Criste were the fra wa!\" The berne bovnit to the burgh with ane blith cheir, Fand the yettis vnclosit, and thrang in full thra. His hors he tyit to ane tre, treuly that tyde; Syne hynt to ane hie hall That wes astalit with pall; Weill wroght wes the wall, And payntit with pride. VI. The sylour deir of the deise dayntely wes dent With the doughtyest in thair dais dyntis couth dele; Bright letteris of gold blith vnto blent, Makand mencioune quha maist of manhede couth mele. He saw nane levand leid vpone loft lent, Nouthir lord na lad, leif ye the lele. The renk raikit in the saill, riale and gent, That wondir wisly wes wroght with wourschip and wele. The berne besely and bane blenkit hym about; He saw throu ane entre Charcole in ane chymne; Ane bright fyre couth he se Birnand full stout. VII. Ane duergh braydit about, besily and bane, Small birdis on broche be ane bright fyre. Schir Kay ruschit to the roist, and reft fra the swane, Lightly claught, throu lust, the lym fra the lyre; To feid hym of that fyne fude the freik wes full fane; Than dynnyt the duergh, in angir and yre, With raris, quhil the rude hall reirdit agane. With that come girdand in greif ane woundir grym sire; With stout contenance and sture he stude thame beforne, With vesage lufly and lang, Body stalwart and strang; That sege wald sit with none wrang Of berne that wes borne. VIII. The knyght carpit to schir Kay, cruel and kene: \"Me think thow fedis the vnfair, freik, be my fay! Suppose thi birny be bright, as bachiler suld ben, Yhit ar thi latis vnlufsum and ladlike, I lay. Quhy has thow marrit my man, with maistri to mene? Bot thow mend hym that mys, be Mary, mylde may, Thow sall rew in thi ruse, with thow but wene, Or thou wend of this wane wemeles away!\" Schir Kay wes haisty and hate, and of ane hie will; Spedely to hym spak: \"Schort amendis will I mak; Thi schore compt I noght ane caik, Traist wele thair till.\" IX. Thair vith the grume, in his grief, leit gird to schir Kay, Fellit the freke with his fist flat in the flure. He wes sa astonayt with the straik, in stede quhare he lay, Stok still as ane stane, the sterne wes sa sture! The freik na forthir he faris, bot foundis away; The tothir drew hym on dreigh, in derne to the dure, Hyit hym hard throu the hall to his haiknay, And sped hym on spedely on the spare mure. The renk restles he raid to Arthour the king; Said: \"lord, wendis on your way, Yone berne nykis yow with nay; To prise hym forthir to pray, It helpis na thing.\" X. Than spak schir Gawane the gay, gratious and gude: \"Schir, ye knaw that schir Kay is crabbit of kynde; I rede ye mak furth ane man, mekar of mude, That will with fairnes fraist frendschip to fynd. Your folk ar febill and faynt for falt of thair fude; Sum better boid-word to abide, vndir wod lynd.\" \"Schir Gawyne, graith ye that gait, for the gude rude! Is nane sa bowsum ane berne, brith for to bynd.\" The heynd knight at his haist held to the tovne; The yettis wappit war wyde, The knyght can raithly in ryde; Reynit his palfray of pryde, Quhen he ves lightit doune. XI. Schir Gawyne gais furth the gait, that graithit wes gay, The quhilk that held to the hall heyndly to se; Than wes the syre in the saill, with renkis of array, And blith birdis hym about, that bright wes of ble. Wourthy schir Gawyne went on his way; Sobirly the souerane salust has he: \"I am send to your self, ane charge for to say, Fra cumly Arthur, the king, cortesse and fre; Quhilk prays for his saik and your gentrice, That he might cum this toun till, To by vittale at will, Alse deir as segis will sell, Payand the price.\" XII. Than said the syre of the saill and the souerane: \"I will na vittale be sauld your senyeour vntill.\" \"That is at your avne will,\" said wourthy Gawane; \"To mak you lord of your avne, me think it grete skill.\" Than right gudly that grome ansuerit agane: \"Quhy I tell the this taill, tak tent now thair till: Pase on thi purpos furth to the plane; For all the wyis I weild ar at his avne will How to luge and to leynd, and in my land lent; Gif I sauld hym his awin, It war wrang to be knawin; Than war I wourthy to be drawin Baldly on bent. XIII. \"Thare come ane laithles leid air to this place, With ane girdill ourgilt, and vthir light gere; It kythit be his cognisance ane knight that he wes, Bot he wes ladlike of laitis, and light of his fere. The verray cause of his come I knew noght the cace, Bot wondirly wraithly he wroght, and all as of were. wraighly. Yit wait I noght quhat he is, be Goddis grete grace! Bot gif it happin that he be ane knyght of youris here, Has done my lord to displeise, that I hym said ryght, And his presence plane, I say yow in certane, He salbe set agane, As I am trew knight!\" XIV. Schir Gavyne gettis his leif, and grathis to his steid, And broght to the bauld king boidword of blis: \"Weill gretis yow, lord, yone lusty in leid, And says hym likis in land your langour to lis; All the wyis and welth he weildis in theid wyis in welth. Cf. 188. Sall halely be at your will, all that is his.\" Than he merkit with myrth our ane grene meid, With all the best, to the burgh, of lordis, I wis. The knight kepit the king, cumly and cleir; With lordis and ladyis of estate, Met hym furth on the gate, Syne tuke him in at yate With ane blith cheir. XV. He had that heynd to ane hall, hiely on hight, With dukis and digne lordis, doughty in deid. \"Ye ar welcum, cumly king,\" said the kene knyght, \"Ay, quhil you likis and list, to luge in this leid. Heir I mak yow of myne maister of myght, Of all the wyis and welth I weild in this steid. Thair is na ridand roy, be resoun and right, Sa deir welcum this day, doutles but dreid. I am your cousing of kyn, I mak to yow knawin; This kyth and this castell, Firth, forest and fell, Ay, quhill yow likis to duell, Ressaue as your awin. XVI. \"I may refresch yow with folk, to feght gif you nedis, With thretty thousand tald, and traistfully tight, Of wise, wourthy and wight, in thair were wedis, Baith with birny and brand to strenth you ful stright, Weill stuffit in steill, on thair stout stedis.\" Than said king Arthur hym self, seymly be sight: \"Sic frendschip I hald fair, that forssis thair dedis; Thi kyndnes salbe quyt, as I am trew knight.\" Than thay buskit to the bynke, beirnis of the best; The king crovnit with gold, Dukis deir to behold, Allyns the banrent bold Gladit his gest. XVII. Thair myght seruice be sene, with segis in saill, Thoght all selcought war soght fra the son to the see; Wynis went within that wane, maist wourthy to vaill, In coupis of cleir gold, brichtest of blee. It war full teir for to tell treuly in taill The seir courssis that war set in that semblee. The meriest war menskit on mete, at the maill, With menstralis myrthfully makand thame glee. Thus thay solaist thame selvin, suthly to say, Al thay four days to end; The king thankit the heynd, Syne tuke his leve for to wend, And went on his way. XVIII. Thus refreschit he his folk in grete fusioun, With outin wanting in waill, wastell or wyne. Thai turssit vp tentis and turnit of toun, The roy with his Round Tabill, richest of ryne. Thay drive on the da deir be dalis and doun, And of the nobillest be-name, noumerit of nyne. Quhen it drew to the dirk nycht, and the day yeid doun, Thai plantit doun pauillonis, proudly fra thine. Thus iournait gentilly thyr cheualrouse knichtis, Ithandly ilk day, Throu mony fer contray, Our the mountains gay, pay. Cf. 309. Holtis and hillis. XIX. Thai passit in thare pilgramage, the proudest in pall, The prince provit in prese, that prise wes and deir; Syne war thai war of ane wane, wrocht with ane wal, Reirdit on ane riche roche, beside ane riveir, With doubill dykis be-dene drawin our all; Micht nane thame note with invy, nor nygh thame to neir. nor ny t . The land wes likand in large and lufsum to call; Propir schene schane the son, seymly and seir. The king stude vesiand the wall, maist vailyeand to se: On that river he saw Cumly towris to knaw; The roy rekinnit on raw Thretty and thre. XX. Apone that riche river, randonit full evin, The side-wallis war set, sad to the see; Scippis saland thame by, sexty and sevyn, To send, quhen thame self list, in seir cuntre, That al thai that ar wrocht vndir the hie hevin Micht nocht warne thame at wil to ische nor entre. Than carpit the cumly king, with ane lowd stevin: \"Yone is the seymliast sicht that euer couth I se. Gif thair be ony keyne knycht that can tell it, Quha is lord of yone land, Lusty and likand, Or quham of is he haldand, Fayne wald I wit.\" XXI. Than schir Spynagrose with speche spak to the king: \"Yone lord haldis of nane leid, that yone land aw, lordis. Bot euer-lesting but legiance, to his leving, As his eldaris has done, enduring his daw.\" \"Hevinly god!\" said the heynd, \"how happynis this thing? Herd thair euer ony sage sa selcouth ane saw! Sal neuer myne hart be in saill na in liking, Bot gif I loissing my life, or be laid law, Be the pilgramage compleit I pas for saull prow, Bot dede be my destenyng, He sall at my agane cumyng Mak homage and oblissing, I mak myne avow!\" XXII. \"A! lord, sparis of sic speche, quhill ye speir more, For abandonit will he noght be to berne that is borne. Or he be strenyeit with strenth, yone sterne for to schore, Mony ledis salbe loissit, and liffis forlorne. Spekis na succeudry, for Cristis sone deir! Yone knicht to scar with skaitht ye chaip nocht but scorne. It is full fair for to be fallow and feir To the best that has bene brevit you beforne. The myghty king of Massidone, wourthiest but wene, Thair gat he nane homage, For all his hie parage, Of lord of yone lynage, Nor neuer none sene, XXIII. \"The wy that wendis for to were quhen he wenys best, All his will in this warld, with welthis I wys, Yit sall be licht as leif of the lynd lest, he licht. That welteris doun with the wynd, sa wauerand it is. . . . . . Your mycht and your maieste mesure but mys.\" \"In faith,\" said the cumly king, \"trou ye full traist, throu. My hecht sall haldin be, for baill or for blis. Sall neuer my likame be laid vnlaissit to sleip, Quhill I haue gart yone berne bow, As I haue maid myne auow, Or ellis mony wedou Ful wraithly sal weip.\" XXIV. Thair wes na man that durst mel to the king, Quhan thai saw that mighty sa mouit in his mude. Quhy . . . mynde. The roy rial raid withoutin resting, And socht to the ciete of Criste, our the salt flude. With mekil honour in erd he maid his offering, Syne buskit hame the samyne way that he before yude. Thayr wes na spurris to spair, spedely thai spring; Thai brochit blonkis to thair sidis brist of rede blude. Thus the roy and his rout restles thai raid Ithandly ilk day, Our the montains gay, pay. Cf. 233. To Rome tuke the reddy way, Withoutin mare abaid. XXV. Thai plantit doun ane pailyeoun, vpone ane plane lee, Of pall and of pillour that proudly wes picht, With rapis of rede gold, riale to see, And grete ensenyes of the samyne, semly by sicht; Bordouris about, that bricht war of ble, Betin with brint gold, burely and bricht; Frenyeis of fyne silk, fretit ful fre With deir dyamonthis bedene, that dayntely wes dicht. The king cumly in kith, couerit with croune, Callit knichtis sa kene, Dukis douchty bedene: \"I rede we cast ws betuene, How best is to done.\" XXVI. Than spak ane vight weriour, wourthy and wise: \"I rede ane sayndis-man ye send to yone senyeour, Of the proudest in pall, and haldin of prise, Wise, vailyeing, and moist of valour. Gif yone douchty in deid wil do your deuise, Be boune at your bidding in burgh and in bour, Ressaue him reuerendly, as resoun in lyis; . . . . . And gif he nykis you with nay, yow worthis on neid For to assege yone castel With cant men and cruel, Durandly for to duel Euer quhill ye speid.\" XXVII. Than shir Gauane the gay, grete of degre, And shir Lancelot de Lake, without lesing, And auenand schir Ewin, thai ordanit that thre To the schore chiftane, chargit fra the kyng. Spynagros than spekis, said: \"lordingis in le, I rede ye tent treuly to my teching; For I knaw yone bauld berne better than ye, His land, and his lordschip, and his leuing. And ye ar thre in this thede, thriuand oft in thrang; War al your strenthis in ane, In his grippis and ye gane, He wald ourcum yow ilkane; Yone sterne is sa strang. XXVIII. \"And he is maid on mold meik as ane child, Blith and bousum that berne as byrd in hir bour, Fayr of fell and of face as flour vnfild, Wondir staluart and strang, to striue in ane stour. Thairfore meikly with mouth mel to that myld, And mak him na manance, bot al mesoure. Thus with trety ye cast yon trew vndre tyld, you trew. And faynd his frendschip to fang with fyne fauour. It hynderis neuer for to be heyndly of speche; He is ane lord riale, Ane seymly souerane in sale, Has seymly. Ane wourthy wy for to wale, Throu all this varld reche.\" XXIX. \"Thi counsale is convenabill, kynd and courtese; Forthi ws likis thi lair listin and leir.\" Thai wyis, wourthy in weid, wend on thair ways, And caryis to the castell, cumly and cleir; Sent ane saynd to the souerane sone, and hym sais, Thre knichtis fra court cum thay weir. Than the ledis belife the lokkis vnlaissis; On fute freschly thai frekis foundis but feir; The renkis raithly can raik in to the round hald. Thair met thame at the entre Ladys likand to se, Thretty knichtis and thre, That blith war and bald. XXX. Thai war courtes and couth thair knyghthed to kyth, Athir vthir wele gret in gretly degre; Thai bowit to the bernys, that bright war and blith, Fair in armys to fang, of figure sa fre. Syne thay sought to the chalmer, swiftly and swith, The gait to the grete lord semely to se, And salust the souerane sone, in ane sith, Courtesly inclinand, and kneland on kne. Ane blithar wes neuer borne of bane nor of blude; All thre in certane Salust the souerane, And he inclynand agane, Hatles, but hude. XXXI. Than schir Gawyne the gay, gude and gracius, That euer wes beildit in blis, and bounte embrasit, Joly and gentill, and full cheuailrus, That neuer poynt of his prise wes fundin defasit, Egir and ertand, and ryght anterus, Illuminat vith lawte, and with lufe lasit, Melis of the message to schir Golagrus. Before the riale on raw the renk wes noght rasit; With ane clene contenance, cumly to knaw, Said: \"our souerane Arthour Gretis the with honour, Has maid ws thre as mediatour, His message to schaw. XXXII. \"He is the riallest roy, reuerend and rike, Of all the rentaris to ryme or rekin on raw. Thare is na leid on life of lordschip hym like, Na nane sa doughty of deid, induring his daw. Mony burgh, mony bour, mony big bike, Mony kynrik to his clame, cumly to knaw, Maneris full menskfull, with mony deip dike; Selcouth war the sevint part to say at saw. at faw. Thare anerdis to our nobill, to note quhen hym nedis, Tuelf crovnit kingis in feir, With all thair strang poweir, And mony wight weryer, Worthy in wedis. XXXIII. \"It has bene tauld hym with tong, trow ye full traist, Your dedis, your dignite and your doughtynes, Brevit throu bounte for ane of the best That now is namyt neir of all nobilnes, Sa wyde quhare wourscip walkis be west. Our seymly souerane hym self, forsuth, will noght cese, Quhill he haue frely fangit your frendschip to fest; Gif pament or praier mught mak that purchese, For na largese my lord noght wil he neuer let, Na for na riches to rigne. I mak you na lesing, It war his maist yarnyng Your grant for to get.\" XXXIV. Than said the syre of the sail, with sad sembland: \"I thank your gracious grete lord and his gude wil; Had euer leid of this land, that had bene leuand, Had neuer. Maid ony feute before, freik, to fulfil, I suld sickirly myself be consentand, And seik to your souerane, seymly on syll. Sen hail our doughty elderis has bene endurand, Thriuandly in this thede, vnchargit as thril, If I, for obeisance or boist, to bondage me bynde, I war wourthy to be Hingit heigh on ane tre, That ilk creature might se, To waif with the wynd. XXXV. \"Bot sauand my senyeoury fra subiectioun, And my lordscip vn-lamyt, withoutin legiance, All that I can to yone king, cumly with croun, I sall preif all my pane to do hym plesance; Baith with body and beild, bowsum and boun, Hym to mensk on mold, withoutin manance. Bot nowthir for his senyeoury, nor for his summoun, Na for dreid of na dede, na for na distance, I will noght bow me ane bak for berne that is borne; Quhill I may my wit wald, I think my fredome to hald, As my eldaris of ald Has done me beforne.\" XXXVI. Thai lufly ledis at that lord thair leuis has laught; Bounit to the bauld king, and boidword him broght. Than thai schupe for to assege segis vnsaught, Ay the manlyest on mold, that maist of myght moght. Thair wes restling and reling, but rest that raught, Mony sege our the sey to the cite socht; Schipmen our the streme thai stithil full straught, With alkin wappyns, I wys, that wes for were wroght. Thai bend bowis of bras braithly within; Pellokis paisand to pase, Gapand gunnys of brase, Grundin ganyeis thair wase, That maid ful gret dyn. XXXVII. Thair wes blauing of bemys, braging and beir; Bretynit doune braid wod, maid bewis full bair; Wrightis welterand doune treis, wit ye but weir, Ordanit hurdys ful hie in holtis sa haire, For to greif thair gomys, gramest that wer, To gar the gayest on grund grayne vndir geir. Thus thai schupe for ane salt, ilk sege seir; Ilka souerane his ensenye shewin has thair; Ferly fayr wes the feild, flekerit and faw With gold and goulis in greyne, Schynand scheirly and scheyne; The sone, as cristall sa cleyne, In scheildis thai schaw. schair. XXXVIII. Be it wes mydmorne and mare, merkit on the day, Schir Golagros mery men, menskful of myght, In greis and garatouris, grathit full gay, Seuyne score of scheildis thai schew at ane sicht; Ane helme set to ilk scheild, siker of assay, With fel lans on loft, lemand ful light. Thus flourit thai the fore front, thair fays to fray, The frekis, that war fundin ferse and forssy in fight. Ilk knyght his cunysance kithit full cleir; Thair names writtin all thare, Quhat berne that it bare, That ilk freke quhare he fare Might wit quhat he weir. XXXIX. \"Yone is the warliest wane,\" said the wise king, \"That euer I vist in my walk, in all this warld wyde; And the straitest of stuf, with richese to ring, With vnabasit bernys bergane to abide; May nane do thame na deir with vndoyng; Yone house is sa huge hie, fra harme thame to hide. Yit sal I mak thame vnrufe, foroutin resting, And reve thame thair rentis, with routis full ride, Thoght I suld fynd thame new notis for this ix yeir; And in his avne presence Heir sall I mak residence, Bot he with force mak defence, With strenth me to steir.\" XL. \"Quhat nedis,\" said Spinagrus, \"sic notis to nevin, Or ony termis be turnit, I tell you treuly? For thair is segis in yone saill wil set vpone sevin, Or thay be wrangit, I wis, I warne you ilk wy. Nane hardiar of hertis vndir the hevin, Or thay be dantit with dreid, erar will thai de; And thai with men vpone mold be machit full evin, Thai salbe fundin right ferse, and full of cheualrie. Schir, ye ar in your maieste, your mayne and your myght, Yit within thir dais thre, The sicker suth sall ye se, Quhat kin men that thai be, And how thai dar fight.\" XLI. As the reuerend roy wes reknand vpone raw, With the rout of the Round Tabill, that wes richest, The king crounit with gold, cumly to knaw, With reuerend baronis and beirnis of the best, He hard ane bugill blast brym and ane loud blaw, As the seymly sone silit to the rest. A gome gais to ane garet, glisnand to schaw, Agane gais. Turnit to ane hie toure, that tight wes full trest; Ane helme of hard steill in hand has he hynt, Ane scheld wroght all of weir, Semyt wele vpone feir; He grippit to ane grete speir, And furth his wais wynt. XLII. \"Quhat signifyis yone schene scheild?\" said the senyeour, \"The lufly helme and the lance, all ar away, The brym blast that he blew with ane stevin stour?\" Than said sir Spynagrus with speche: \"the suth sall I say. Yone is ane freik in his force, and fresch in his flour, in his forte. To se that his schire weid be sicker of assay; He thinkis provese to preve, for his paramour, And prik in your presence, to purchese his pray. Forthi makis furth ane man, to mach hym in feild, That knawin is for cruel, Doughty dyntis to dell, That for the maistry dar mell With schaft and with scheild.\" XLIII. Than wes the king wondir glaid, and callit Gaudifeir; Quhilum in Britane that berne had baronyis braid; And he gudly furth gais, and graithit his geir, And buskit hym to battell, without mair abaid. That wy walit, I vis, all wedis of veir That nedit hym to note gif he nane had. . . . . . Bery broune wes the blonk, burely and braid, Wpone the mold, quhare thai met, before the myd-day. With lufly lancis and lang, Ane faire feild can thai fang, On stedis stalwart and strang, Baith blanchart and bay. XLIV. Gaudifeir and Galiot, in glemand steil wedis, As glauis glowand on gleid, grymly thai ride; Wondir sternly thai steir on thair stent stedis Athir berne fra his blonk borne wes that tide. Thai ruschit vp rudly, quha sa right redis; Out with suerdis thai swang fra thair schalk side; Thair with wraithly thai wirk, thai wourthy in vedis, Hewit on the hard steill, and hurt thame in the hide. Sa wondir freschly thai frekis fruschit in feir, Throw all the harnes thai hade, Baith birny and breist-plade, Thairin wappynis couth wade, Wit ye but weir. XLV. Thus thai faught vpone fold, with ane fel fair, Quhill athir berne in that breth bokit in blude; Thus thai mellit on mold, ane myle way and maire, Wraithly wroht, as thei war witlese and wode; Baith thai segis forsuth, sadly and sair, Thoght thai war astonait, in that stour stithly thai stude. The feght sa felly thai fang, with ane fresch fair, Quhil Gaudifeir and Galiot baith to grund yhude. Gaudifeir gat vp agane, throu Goddis grete mightis; Abone him wichtely he wan, With the craft that he can; Thai louit God and sanct An, The king and his knightis. XLVI. Than wes Galiot the gome hynt in till ane hald; Golagrus grew in greif, grymly in hart, And callit schir Rigal of Rone, ane renk that wes bald. \"Quhill this querrell be quyt, I cover neuer in quert. With wailit wapnis of were, evin on yone wald, On ane sterand steid, that sternly will stert, I pray the, for my saik, that it be deir sald; Was neuer sa vnsound set to my hert.\" That gome gudly furth gays and graithit his gere, Blew ane blast of ane horne, As wes the maner beforne; Scheld and helm has he borne Away with his spere. XLVII The king crovnit with gold this cumpas wele knew, And callit schir Rannald, cruell and kene: \"Gif ony pressis to this place, for proves to persew, Schaip the evin to the schalk, in thi schroud schene.\" The deir dight him to the deid, be the day dew; His birny and his basnet, burnist full bene; Baith his horse and his geir wes of ane hale hew, With gold and goulis sa gay graithit in grene; Ane schene scheild and ane schaft, that scharply was sched; Thre ber-hedis he bair, As his eldaris did air, Quhilk beirnis in Britane wair, Of his blude bled. XLVIII. Quhen the day can daw, deirly on hight, And the sone in the sky wes schynyng so schir, Fra the castell thair come cariand ane knight, Closit in clene steill, vpone ane coursyr. Schir Rannald to his riche steid raikit full right, Lightly lap he on loft, that lufly of lyre. Athir laught has thair lance, that lemyt so light; On twa stedis thai straid, with ane sterne schiere. Togiddir freschly thai frekis fruschit, in fay; Thair speris in splendris sprent, On scheldis schonkit and schent, Euin our thair hedis went, In feild fir away. XLIX. Thai lufly ledis belife lightit on the land, And laught out suerdis, lufly and lang; Thair stedis stakkerit in the stour, and stude stummerand, Al to-stiffillit and stonayt, the strakis war sa strang! Athir berne braithly bet with ane bright brand; On fute freschly thai frekis feghtin thai fang; Thai hewit on hard steil, hartly with hand, Quhil the spalis and the sparkis spedely out sprang. Schir Rannald raught to the renk ane rout wes vnryde; Clenely in the collair, Fifty mailyeis and mair Euin of the schuldir he schair, Ane wound that wes wyde. L. Thus thai faucht on fute, on the fair feild; The blude famyt thame fra, on feild quhare thai found; All the bernys on the bent about that beheild, For pure sorow of that sight thai sighit vnsound. Schire teris schot fra schalkis, schene vndir scheild, Quhen thai foundrit and ane. fel fey to the grund; Baith thair hartis can brist, braithly but beild, Thair wes na staluart vnstonait, so sterne wes the stound! Schir Rannaldis body wes broght to the bright tent; Syne to the castel of stone Thai had schir Regal of Rone; With mekil murnyng and mone Away with him went. LI. Thus endit the auynantis with mekil honour; Yit has men thame in mynd for thair manhede; Thair bodeis wes beryit baith in ane hour, Set segis for thair saullis to syng and to reid. Than Gologrus graithit of his men in glisnand armour Ane schir Louys the lele, ane lord of that leid; Ane vthir heght Edmond, that prouit paramour; The thrid heght schir Bantellas, the batal to leid; The ferd wes ane weryour worthy and wight, His name wes schir Sanguel, Cumly and cruel; Thir four, treuly to tell, Foundis to the feght. LII. Schir Lyonel to schir Louys wes leuit, with ane lance; Schir Ewin to shir Edmond, athir ful euin; Schir Bedwar to schir Bantellas, to enschew his chance, That baith war nemmyt in neid, nobil to neuin; To schir Sangwel soght gude Gyromalance. Thus thai mellit and met with ane stout steuin, Thir lufly ledis on the land, without legiance; With seymely scheildis to schew, thai set vpone seuin, Thir cumly knightis to kyth ane cruel course maid. The frekis felloune in feir Wondir stoutly can steir, With geir grundin ful cleir Rudly thai raid. LIII. Than thair hors vith thair hochis sic harmis couth hint, As trasit in vnquart quakand thai stand; The frekis freschly thai fure, as fyre out of flynt, Thair lufly lancis thai loissit, and lichtit on the land; Right styth, stuffit in steill, thai stotit na stynt, Bot buskit to battaille with birny and brand. Thair riche birnys thai bet derfly with dynt, Hewis doun in grete haist, hartly with hand. Thai mighty men vpon mold ane riale course maid, Quhill clowis of clene maill Hoppit out as the haill; Thay beirnys in the bataill Sa bauldly thai baid! LIV. Thai bet on sa bryimly, thai beirnys on the bent, Bristis birneis with brandis burnist full bene; Throu thair schene scheildis thair schuldiris var schent, Fra schalkis schot schire blude our scheildis so schene; Ryngis of rank steill rattillit and rent, Gomys grisly on the grund granis on the grene. The roy ramyt for reuth, richist of rent, For cair of his knightis cruel and kene, Sa wondir freschly thair force thai frest on the feildis! Sa huge wes the melle, Wes nane sa sutell couth se Quhilk gome suld gouern the gre, Bot God that al weildis. LV. The wyis wroght vthir grete wandreth and weuch, Wirkand woundis full wyde with wapnis of were; Helmys of hard steill thai hatterit and heuch, In that hailsing thai hynt grete harmys and here; All to-turnit thair entyre, traistly and tewch, Burnist bladis of steill throw birneis thay bere; Schort suerdis of scheith smertly thay dreuch, Athir freik to his fallow, with fellonne affere; Throw platis of polist steill thair poyntis can pase. All thus thai threw in that thrang Stalwart strakis and strang; With daggaris derfly thay dang, Thai doughtyis on dase. LVI. Schir Lyonell schir Lowes laught has in hand, And sesit is Sangwell with Giromalans the gude; Schir Evin has schir Edmond laid on the land, Braithly bartynit with baill, bullerand in blude; Schir Bedwar to schir Bantellas yaldis vp his brand, In that stalwart stour thay styth men in stude. Wes nane forssy on fold, that wes feghtand, Wnmanglit and marrit, myghtles in mude; Wes nane sa proud of his part, that prisit quhen he yeid. Bedwer and Lyonell War led to the castell; The cumly knight Sangwell To Arthour thay led. LVII. Schir Edmond loissit has his life, and laid is full law; Schir Evin hurtis has hynt hidwise and sair; Knightis caryis to the corse, wes cumly to knaw, And had hym to the castell with mekill hard cair; Thai did to that doughty as the dede aw. Wthir four of the folk foundis to the fair, That wes dight to the dede, be the day can daw; Than said bernys bald, brym as bair: \"We sal evin that is od, or end in the pane!\" Thai stuffit helmys in hy, Breist-plait and birny; Thay renkis maid reddy All geir that myght gane. LVIII. Schir Agalus, schir Ewmond, honest and habill, Schir Mychin, schir Meligor, men of grete estait; Than stertis out ane sterne knyght, stalwart and stabill, Ane berne that heght schir Hew, hardy and hait. Now wil I rekkin the renkis of the Round Tabill, That has traistly thame tight to governe that gait; Furth faris the folk, but fenyeing or fabill, That bemyt war be the lord, lufsum of lait: Schir Cador of Cornwel, cumly and cleir, Schir Owales, schir Iwell, Schir Myreot, mighty emell; Thir four, treuly to tell, Foundis in feir. LIX. Thair wes na trety of treux, trow ye full traist, Quhen thai myghty can mach, on mold quhair thai met; Thai brochit blonkis to thair sydis out of blude braist, Thair lufly lancis thai loissit, and lightit but let; Sadillis thai temyt tyt, thir trew men and traist, Braidit out brandis, on birnys thai bet; As fyre that fleis fra the flynt, thay fechtin sa fast, With vengeand wapnis of were throu wedis thai wet. It war teirfull to tell treuly the tend Of thair strife sa strang, The feght so fellely thai fang; Thoght it lestit neuer so lang, Yit laught it ane end. LX. Schir Oviles, schir Iwill, in handis war hynt, And to the lufly castell war led in ane lyng; Thair with the stalwartis in stour can stotin and stynt, And baith schir Agalus and schir Hew wes led to the kyng. Than schir Golograse for greif his gray ene brynt, Wod wraith as the wynd, his handis can wryng. Yit makis he mery, magry quhasa mynt; Said: \"I sal bargane abyde, and ane end bryng; To morne, sickirly, my self sall seik to the feild.\" He buskit to ane barfray, Twa smal bellis rang thay; Than seymly Arthur can say, Wes schene vndir scheild. LXI. \"Quhat signifyis yone rynging?\" said the ryale; Than said Spynagros with speche: \"schir, sen speir, That sall I tell yow with tong, treuly in taill. The wy that weildis yone wane, I warn you but weir, He thinkis his aune self shall do for his dail; Is nane sa prouit in this part of pyth is his peir. prouit is. Yow worthis wisly to wirk, ane wy for to wail, That sal duchtely his deid do with yone deir. He is the forsiest freik, be fortoune his freynd, That I wait leuand this day.\" Than schir Gawine the gay Prayt for the iournay, That he myght furth weynd. LXII. The king grantit the gait to schir Gawane, And prayt to the grete God to grant him his grace, Him to saue and to salf, that is our souerane, As he is makar of man, and alkyn myght haise. Than schir Spynagros, the freik, wox ferly vnfane, Murnyt for schir Gawyne, and mekil mayne maise, And said: \"for his saik, that saiklese wes slane, Tak nocht yone keyne knight to countir, in this hard cais. Is nane sa stalwart in stour, with stoutnes to stand; Of al that langis to the king, The mair is my murnyng, Ye suld this fell fechting Hynt vpone hand. LXIII. \"Sen ye ar sa wourschipfull, and wourthy in were, Demyt with the derrest, maist doughty in deid, Yone berne in the battale wil ye noght forbere, For al the mobil on the mold, merkit to meid.\" \"Gif I de doughtely, the les is my dere, Thoght he war Sampsone himself, sa me Criste reid! the war. I forsaik noght to feght, for al his grete feir, I do the weill for to wit, doutlese but dreid.\" Than said schir Spynagrose: \"sen ye will of neid Be bovn to the battale, Wirkis with counsale, It sall right gret avale, And do it in deid. LXIV. \"Quhen ye mach hym on mold, merk to hym evin, And bere ye your bright lance in myddis his scheild; Mak that course cruel, for Crystis lufe of hevin! And syne wirk as I wise, your vappins to weild. Be he stonayt, yone sterne, stout beis his stevin, He wourdis brym as ane bair, that bydis na beild; Noy you noght at his note, that nobill is to nevin. Suppose his dyntis be deip dentit in your scheild, Tak na haist vpone hand, quhat happunys may hynt; Bot lat the riche man rage, And fecht in his curage, To swyng with suerd quhil he suage; Syne dele ye your dynt. LXV. \"Quhen he is stuffit, thair strike, and hald hym on steir, Sa sal ye stonay yone stowt, suppose he be strang; Thus may ye lippin on the lake, throu lair that I leir; Bot gif ye wirk as wise, you worthis that wrang.\" The king and his knihtis, cumly and cleir, In armour dewly hym dight, be the day sprang; Than wes schir Kay wondir wo, wit ye but weir, In defalt of ane freik the feghting to fang. That gome gudely furth gais, and graithit his geir; Evin to the castell he raid, Huvit in ane dern slaid; Sa come ane knight as he baid, Anairmit of weir. LXVI. That knight buskit to schir Kay one ane steid broune, Braissit in birneis and basnet full bene; He cryis his ensenye and conteris hym full soune, And maid ane course curagiouse, cruell and kene; Thair lufly lancis thai loissit, and lightit baith doune, And girdit out suerdis on the grund grene, And hewit on hard steill, hartlie but houne; Rude reknyng raise thair renkis betuene. Thair mailyeis with melle thay merkit in the medis; The blude of thair bodeis Throw breist-plait and birneis, As roise ragit on rise, Our ran thair riche vedis. LXVII. Thus thai faught vpone fute, without fenyeing; The sparkis flaw in the feild, as fyre out of flynt; Thai lufly ledis in lyke, thai layid on in ane ling, Delis thair full doughtely mony derf dynt; Duschand on deir wedis, dourly thai dyng, Hidwise hurtis and huge haistely thai hynt. That knight carpit to schir Kay, of discomforting: \"Of this stonay and stour I rede that ye stynt. I will yeild the my brand, sen na better may bene. Quhair that fortoune will faill, Thair may na besynes availl.\" He braidit vp his ventaill, That closit wes clene. LXVIII. For to ressaue the brand the berne wes full blith, For he wes byrsit and beft, and braithly bledand; Thoght he wes myghtles, his mercy can he thair myth, And wald that he nane harm hynt with hart and with hand. Thai caryit baith to the kynge, cumly to kyth; to the kynde. Thair lancis war loissit, and left on the land. Than said he loud vpone loft: \"lord, will ye lyth, Ye sall nane torfeir betyde, I tak vpone hand. Na mysliking haue in hart, nor haue ye na dout; Oft in romanis I reid: Airly sporne, late speid.\" The king to the pailyeoune gart leid The knight that wes stout. LXIX. Thai hynt of his harnese, to helyn his wound; Lechis war noght to lait, with sawis sa sle. With that mony fresch freik can to the feild found, With Gologras in his geir, grete of degre; Armyt in rede gold, and rubeis sa round, With mony riche relikis, riale to se. Thair wes on Gologras, quhair he glaid on the ground, Frenyeis of fine silk, fratit full fre. Apone sterand stedis, trappit to the heill, Sexty schalkis full schene, Cled in armour sa clene, No wy wantit, I wene, All stuffit in steill. LXX. That berne raid on ane blonk, of ane ble quhite, Blyndit all with bright gold and beriallis bright; To tell of his deir weid war doutles delite, And alse ter for to tell the travalis war tight. His name and his nobillay wes noght for to nyte; Thair wes na hathill sa heich, be half ane fute hicht. He lansit out our ane land, and drew noght ane lyte, Quhair he suld frastyn his force, and fangin his fight. Be that schir Gawyne the gay wes graithit in his gere; Cummyng on the ta syde, Hovand battale to abyde, All reddy samyne to ryde, With schelde and with spere. LXXI. Thir lufly ledis on the land left be thame allane, Tuke nowthir fremmyt nor freyndis, bot found thame fra; Twa rynnyng renkis raith the riolyse has tane, Ilk freik to his feir, to frestin his fa. Thai gird one tva grete horse, on grund quhil thai grane; The trew helmys and traist in tathis thai ta; The rochis reirdit vith the rasch, quhen thai samyne rane; Thair speris in the feild in flendris gart ga. The stedis stakerit in the stour, for streking on stray; The bernys bowit abak, Sa woundir rude wes the rak; Quhilk that happynnit the lak, Couth na leid say! LXXII. Thai brayd fra thair blonkis, besely and bane, Syne laught out suerdis, lang and lufly; And hewit on hard steill, wondir hawtane, Baith war thai haldin of hartis heynd and hardy. Gologras grew in greif at schir Gawane; On the hight of the hard steill he hyt hym in hy; Pertly put with his pith at his pesane, And fulyeit of the fyne maill ma than fyfty. The knight stakrit with the straik, all stonayt in stound; Sa woundir scharply he schair, The berne that the brand bair; Schir Gawyne, with ane fell fair, Can to his faa found. LXXIII. With ane bitand brand, burly and braid, Quhilk oft in battale had bene his bute and his belde, He leit gird to the grome, with greif that he had, And claif throw the cantell of the clene schelde. Throw birny and breist-plait and bordour it baid; The fulye of the fyne gold fell in the feild. The rede blude with the rout folowit the blaid, For all the wedis, I wise, that the wy weild, Throw claspis of clene gold, and clowis sa cleir. Thair with schir Gologras the syre, In mekill angir and ire, Alse ferse as the fyre, Leit fle to his feir. LXXIV. Sic dintis he delt to that doughty, Leit hym destanyt to danger and dreid; Thus wes he handillit full hait, that hawtane, in hy, The scheld in countir he kest our his cleir weid; Hewit on hard steill woundir haistely; Gart beryallis hop of the hathill about hym on breid. Than the king vnto Criste kest vp ane cry, Said: \"Lord, as thow life lent to levand in leid, As thou formit all frute to foster our fude, Grant me confort this day, As thow art God verray!\" Thus prais the king in affray, For Gawyne the gude. LXXV. Golagras at Gawyne in sic ane grief grew, As lyoune, for falt of fude, faught on the fold; With baith his handis in haist that haltane couth hew; Gart stanys hop of the hathill, that haltane war hold, Birny and breist-plait, bright for to schew; Mony mailye and plait war marrit on the mold. Knichtis ramyt for reuth, schir Gawyne thai rew, That doughty delit with hym sa, for dout he war defold; Sa wondir scharply he schare throu his schene schroud; His scheild he chopit hym fra In tuenty pecis and ma; Schir Wawane writhit for wa, Witlese and woud. LXXVI. Thus wourthit schir Gawyne wraith and wepand, And straik to that stern knight but stynt; All engreuit the grome, with ane bright brand, And delt thairwith doughtely mony derf dynt; Throw byrny and breistplait, bordour and band, He leit fle to the freke, as fyre out of flynt. He hewit on with grete haist, hartly with hand, Hakkit throw the hard weid, to the hede hynt; Throw the stuf with the straik, stapalis and stanis, Schir Wawine, wourthy in wail, Half ane span at ane spail, Quhare his harnes wes hail, He hewit attanis. LXXVII. Thus raithly the riche berne rassit his array; The tothir stertis ane bak, the sterne that wes stout, Hit schir Gawayne on the gere, quhil greuit wes the gay, Betit doune the bright gold and beryallis about; Scheddit his schire wedis scharply away, That lufly lappit war on loft, he gart thame law lout. The sterne stakrit with the straik, and stertis on stray, Quhill neir his resoune wes tynt, sa rude wes the rout! The beryallis on the land of bratheris gart light, Rubeis and sapheir, Precious stanis that weir; Thus drese thai wedis sa deir, That dantely wes dight. LXXVIII. Thai gyrd on sa grymly, in ane grete ire, Baith schir Gavine the grome, and Gologras the knight, The sparkis flew in the feild, as fagottis of fire, Sa wndir frely thai frekis fangis the fight; Thai luschit and laid on, thai luflyis of lyre. King Arthur Ihesu besoght, seymly with sight: \"As thow art souerane God, sickerly, and syre, At thow wald warys fra wo Wauane the wight, And grant the frekis on fold farar to fall, Baith thair honouris to saif.\" At Crist with credence thai craif, Knight, squyar and knaif; And thus pray thay all. LXXIX. Thai mellit on with malice, thay myghtyis in mude, Mankit throu mailyeis, and maid thame to mer; Wraithly wroght, as thai war witlese and wod. Be that schir Wawane the wy likit the wer; The ble of his bright weid wes bullerand in blude. Thair with the nobill in neid nyghit hym ner, Straik hym with ane steill brand, in stede quhare he stude; The scheld in fardellis can fle, in feild away fer; The tothir hyt hym agane with ane hard swerd. As he loutit our ane bra, His feit founderit hym fra; Schir Gologras graithly can ga Grulingis to erd. LXXX. Or euer he gat vp agane, gude schir Gawane Grippit to schir Gologras on the grund grene. Thair of gromys wes glaid, gudly and gane, Lovit Criste of that case with hartis sa clene. Ane daggar dayntely dight that doughty has drawne, Than he carpit to the knight, cruel and kene: \"Gif thou luffis thi life, lelely noght to layne, Yeld me thi bright brand, burnist sa bene; I rede thow wirk as I wise, or war the betide.\" The tothir ansuerit schortly: \"Me think farar to dee, Than schamyt be, verralie, Ane sclander to byde. LXXXI. \"Wes I neuer yit defoullit, nor fylit in fame, Nor nane of my eldaris, that euer I hard nevin; Bot ilk berne has bene vnbundin with blame, Ringand in rialte, and reullit thame self evin. Sall neuer sege vndir son se me with schame, Na luke on my lekame with light nor with levin, nor with leme. Na nane of the nynt degre haue noy of my name, I swere be suthfast God, that settis all on sevin! Bot gif that wourschip of were win me away, I trete for na favour; Do furth thi devoir; Of me gettis thou na more, Doutles this day.\" LXXXII. Lordingis and ladyis in the castell on loft, Quhen thai saw thair liege lord laid on the landis, Mony sweit thing of sware swownit full oft, Wyis wourthit for wo to wringin thair handis. Wes nowthir solace nor sang thair sorow to soft, Ane sair stonay and stour at thair hartis standis. On Criste cumly thay cry: \"on croce as thou coft, With thi blissit blude to bring ws out of bandis, Lat neuer our souerane his cause with schame to encheif! Mary, farest of face, Beseik thi sone in this cace, Ane drop of his grete grace He grant ws to geif!\" LXXXIII. Thus the ledis on loft in langour war lent; The lordis on the tothir side for liking thay leugh. Schir Gawyne tretit the knight to turn his entent, For he wes wondir wa to wirk hym mare wugh. \"Schir, say for thi self, thow seis thou art schent; It may nocht mend the ane myte to mak it so teugh. Rise, and raik to our roy, richest of rent; Thow salbe newit at neid with nobillay eneuch, And dukit in our duchery, all the duelling.\" \"Than war I woundir vnwis, To purchese proffit for pris, Quhare schame ay euer lyis, All my leuing. LXXXIV. \" The sege that schrenkis for na schame, the schent might hym schend, That mare luffis his life than lois vpone erd; Sal neuer freik on fold, fremmyt nor freynde, Gar me lurk for ane luke, lawit nor lerd; For quhasa with wourschip sall of this warld wende, Thair wil nane wyis, that ar wis, wary the werd. For ony trety may tyde, I tell the the teynd, I wil noght turn myn entent, for all this warld brerd, Or I pair of pris ane penny-worth in this place, For besandis or beryell; I knaw my avne quarrell, I dreid not the pereill To dee in this cace!\" LXXXV. Schir Gawyne rewit the renk, that wes riale, And said to the reuerend, riche and rightuis: \"How may I succour the sound, semely in sale, Before this pepill in plane, and pair noght thy pris?\" \"That sall I tel the with tong, trewly in tale, Wald thow denye the in deid to do my deuis; Lat it worth at my wil the wourschip to wale, As I had wonnyn the of were, wourthy and wis; Syne cary to the castel, quhare I haue maist cure. Thus may thow saif me fra syte; As I am cristynit perfite, I sall thi kyndnes quyte, And sauf thyn honoure.\" LXXXVI. \"That war hard,\" said that heynd, \"sa haue I gude hele! Ane wounder peralous poynt, partenyng grete plight, To soner in thi gentrice, but signete or sele, And I before saw the neuer, sickerly, with sight; To leif in thi laute, and thow war vnlele, Than had I cassin in cair mony kene knight. Bot I knaw thou art kene, and alse cruell; Or thow be fulyeit fey, freke, in the fight, I do me in thi gentrice, be Drightin sa deir!\" He lenyt vp in the place; The tothir raithly vpraise; Gat neuer grome sic ane grace, In feild of his feir! LXXXVII. Than thei nobillis at neid yeid to thair note new; Freschly foundis to feght, all fenyeand thair fair; Tua schort suerdis of scheith smertly thai drew, Than thai mellit on mold, ane myle way and mare. Wes newthir casar nor king thair quentance that knew, It semyt be thair contenance that kendillit wes care. Syne thai traist in that feild, throu trety of trew; Put up thair brandis sa braid, burly and bair. Gologras and Gawyne, gracious and gude, Yeid to the castel of stane, As he war yoldin and tane; The king precious in pane Sair murnand in mude. LXXXVIII. The roy ramand ful raith, that reuth wes to se, And raikit full redles to his riche tent; The watter wet his chekis, that schalkis myght se, As all his welthis in warld had bene away went, And othir bernys for barrat blakynnit thair ble, Braithly bundin in baill, thair breistis war blent. \"The flour of knighthede is caught throu his cruelte! Now is the Round Tabill rebutit, richest of rent, Quhen wourschipfull Wawane, the wit of our were, Is led to ane presoune; Now failyeis gude fortoune!\" The king, cumly with croune, Grat mony salt tere. LXXXIX. Quhen that Gawyne the gay, grete of degre, Wes cummyn to the castel, cumly and cleir, Gromys of that garisoune maid gamyn and gle, And ledis lofit thair lord, lufly of lyere; Beirdis beildit in blise, brightest of ble; The tothir knightis maid care of Arthuris here; Al thus with murnyng and myrth thai maid melle. Ay, quhil the segis war set to the suppere, The seymly souerane of the sail marschel he wes; He gart schir Gawyne vpga, His wife, his doghter alsua, And of that mighty na ma War set at the des. XC. He gart at ane sete burd the strangearis begin, The maist seymly in sale ordanit thame sete; Ilk knyght ane cumly lady, that cleir wes of kyn; With kynde contenance the renk couth thame rehete, Quhen thai war machit at mete, the mare and the myn, And ay the meryest on mold marschalit at mete. Than said he lowd vpone loft, the lord of that in, To al the beirnys about, of gre that wes grete: \"Lufly ledis in land, lythis me til!\" He straik the burd with ane wand, The quilk he held in hand; Thair wes na word muuand, Sa war thai all stil. thair. XCI. \"Heir ye ar gaderit in grosse, al the gretest Of gomys that grip has, vndir my gouernyng, Of baronis and burowis, of braid land the best, And alse the meryest on mold has intrometting.

Quhen this auenand and honest had maid this ansuer, And had tald thair entent trewly him till, Than schir Gologras the gay, in gudly maneir, Said to thai segis, semely on syll, How wourschipful Wavane had wonnin him on weir, To wirk him wandreth or wough, quhilk war his wil; How fair him fell in feght, syne how he couth forbere. \"In sight of his souerane, this did the gentill: He has me sauit fra syte throw his gentrice; It war syn, but recure, The knightis honour suld smure, That did me this honoure, Quhilk maist is of price.

The bludy hart that thai bere the Bruss at his end, With his estatis in the steid, and nobillis ynewe, Addit in thar armes for honorable causs, As his tenderest and deir, In his maist misteir; As salbe said to yow heir A. thow. In to schort sawis. XXXV. The roye Robert the Bruss the rayke he awowit, With all the hart that he had, to the haily graif; Syne quhen the dait of his deid derfly him dowit, With lordis of Scotland, lerit, and the laif, As worthy, wysest to waile, in worschipe allowit, To James lord Dowglas thow the gre gaif, thay the gre.

And we will speike of Dowglace, Quhat way he couth wend. XXXVII. The hert costlye he couth clos in a cler cace, And held all hale the behest he hecht to the king: Come to the haly graf, throw Goddis gret grace, With offerandis and vrisons, and all uthar thing; Our Saluatouris sepultur, and the samyn place, Quhar he raiss, as we reid, richtuiss to ryng; With all the relykis raith, that in that rovme was, He gart hallowe the hart, and syne couth it hyng, About his hals full hende, and on his awne hart. Oft wald he kiss it, and cry: \"O flour of all chewalry! of cheuelry. Quhy leif I, allace! quhy? And thow deid art! XXXVIII. \"My deir,\" quoth the Dowglass, \"art thow deid dicht! to deid dicht.

And quhen the batallis so brym, brathly and bricht, and blicht. War joyned thraly in thrang, mony thousand, Amang the hethin men the hert hardely he slang, Said: \"Wend on as thou was wont, Throw the batell in bront, Ay formast in the front, Thy fays amang.

The wyis quhar the wicht went war in wa wellit; Was nane so stur in the steid micht stand him a start. Thus frayis he the falss folk, trewly to tell it, Aye quhil he cowerit and come to the kingis hart. Thus feile feildis he wan, aye worschipand it.

He ruschit in the gret rowte, the knycht to reskewe; Feile of the fals folk, that fled of befor, Relevit in on thir twa, for to tell trewe, That thai war samyn ourset; tharfor I murn sore. war be the samyn. Thus in defence of the faith, as fermes ynewe, anew. And pite of the pryss knycht that was in thore, of the pretius knicht that wes in pane thore. The douchty Dowglass is deid and adewe, deid doun adew. With loss and with lyking, that lestis evir mor. His hardy men tuke the hart syne vpon hand; Quhen thai had beryit thar lord, With mekle mane to remord, Thai maid it hame be restord In to Scotland. XLII. Be this ressoun we reid, and as our Roy levit, The Dowglass in armes the bludy hart beris; For it bled he his blud, as the bill brevit, And in batallis full braid, vnder baneris, Throw full chevalruss chance he this hert chevit, Fra walit wyis, and wicht, worthy in weris; Mony galiard gome was on the ground levit, grome.

Tharfor of the said tre I tell nocht the teynd, The birth and the branchis, that blomyt so brayd; Quhat fele armes on loft, louely to lend, Of lordingis and sere landis, gudly and glad, in seir landis. The said persewant bure, quhar he away wend, On his garment so gay, of ane hie haid, I leif thaim blasonde to be with harraldis hende; And I will to my first mater, as I eir maid, first om . And begyn, quhar I left, at lordingis deir, The court of the Empriour, How thai come in honour, Thir fowlis of rigour, With a gret reir. L. Than rerit thir Merl&yogh;eonis that mountis so hie, Furth borne bacheleris bald on the bordouris; Busardis and Beldkytis, as it mycht be, Soldiouris and sumptermen to thai sen&yogh;eouris. subiect men. The Pitill and the Pype Gled cryand pewewe, cryand pewe. Befor thir princis ay past, as pert purviouris, as pairt of purveyouris. For thai couth chewiss chikinnis, and perchess pultre, To cleke fra the commonis, as kyngis caytouris; Syne hufe, hover and behald the herbery place. Robyn Redbrest nocht ran, Bot raid as a hensman; And the litill we Wran, That wretchit dorche was. LI. Thar was the haraldis fa, the hobby but fable, Stanchalis, steropis, strecht to thai stern lordis, to thair sterne. With alkyn officeris in erd, awenand and able; So mekle was the multitud no mynd it remordis. Thus assemblit thir segis, syris sen&yogh;eourable, All that war fowlis of reif, the richt quha recordis, quha richtly recordis. For the Temperalite tretit in table. The stern Empriouris style thus staitly restord is, The Pape and the patriarkis, prelatis, I wist, the prelattis. Welcummit thaim wynly, but weir, wysalie. With haly sermonis seir, Pardoun, and prayer, And blythly tham blist. LII. The blissit Pape in the place prayit tham ilkane To remayne to the meit at the mydday; And thai grantit that gud, but grutching, to gane. Than till a wortheliche wane went thai thar way; Past till a palace of pryce plesand allane, Was erekit rially, ryke of array, Pantit and apparalit proudly in pane, Sylit semely with silk, suthly to say.

All thus thai mufe to the meit, and the merschale Gart bring watter to wesche, of a well cleir: That was the Falcoune so fair, frely but fale, Bad birnis burdis vp braid, with a blyth cheir. vpbred. The Pape passit till his place in his pontificale, The athill Empriour anone nechit him neir. Kyngis and patriarkis kend, with cardinalis hale, cardynnallis all. Addressit thaim to that deiss, and dukis so deir. Bischopis bovnis to the burd, and merschionis of mychtis, Erllis of honouris, Abbotis of ordouris, Prowestis and priouris, And mony kene knychtis.

Scutiferis and sqwyeris, and bachilleris blyth, I press nocht all to report; &yogh;e hard thaim expremit; Bot all war merschallit to meit meikly and myth; Syne seruit semely in saile, forsuth as it semyt, With all curis of cost that cukis couth kyth. In flesche tyme, quhen the fische war away flemyt, Quha was stewart bot the Stork, stallwart and styth; Syne all the lentryne but leiss, and the lang reid, And alss in the adwent, The Soland stewart was sent; For he couth fro the firmament Fang the fische deid. LV.

Syne, at the myddis of the meit, in come the menstralis, The Maviss and the Merle syngis, Osillis and Stirlingis, The blyth Lark that begynnis, And the Nychtgalis. LVI. And thar notis anone, gif I richt newyne, notis in ane. War of Mary the myld, this maner I wiss: \"Haile temple of the Trinite, crovnit in hevin! Haile moder of our maker, and medicyn of myss!

All thus our lady thai lovit, with lyking and lyst, thai lofe. Menstralis and musicianis, mo than I mene may. The psaltery, the sytholis, the soft sytharist, The crovde, and the monycordis, the gittyrnis gay; The rote, and the recordour, the rivupe, the rist, The trumpe, and the talburn, the tympane but tray; The lilt pype, and the lute, the fydill in fist, cithill. The dulset, the dulsacordis, the schalme of assay; The amyable organis vsit full oft; Claryonis lowde knellis, Portatiuis, and bellis, Cymbaclanis in the cellis, A. Cymbaclauis? That soundis so soft. LX. Quhen thai had songyn and said, softly and schour, softly a schoure. And playit, as of paradyss it a poynt war, In com japand the Ia, as a juglour, With castis and with cawtelis, a quaynt caryar.

Thus jowkit with juperdyss the jangland Ia: Fair ladyis in ryngis, Knychtis in caralyngis, Boith dansis and syngis; It semyt as sa. LXII. Sa come the Ruke with a rerd and a rane roch, A bard owt of Irland with Banachadee! Said: \"Gluntow guk dynyd dach hala mischy doch; dyny drach. Raike hir a rug of the rost, or scho sall ryiue the.

The dene rurale, the Ravyn, reprovit him than, Bad him his lesingis leif befor thai lordingis. The barde worth brane wod, and bitterly couth ban; \"How Corby messinger,\" quoth he, \"with sorowe now syngis; Thow ischit out of Noyes ark, and to the erd wan, Taryit as a tratour, and brocht na tythingis. as tratour.

In come twa flyrand fulis with a fonde fair, The Tuchet and the gukkit Golk, and &yogh;eid hiddy giddy; Ruschit baith to the bard, and ruggit his hair; Callit him thryss thevisnek, to thrawe in a widdy.

Syne for ane figonale of frut thai straif in the steid; The Tuchet gird to the Golk, and gaif him a fall, Raif his taile fra his rig, with a rath pleid; The Golk gat wpe agane in the gret hall, Tit the Tuchet be the tope, ourtirvit his hed, Flang him flat in the fyre, fetheris and all.

Quhen thai had remelis raucht, Thai forthocht that thai faucht, Kissit samyn and saucht; Kissit syne. And sat dovne syne. LXVI. All thus thir hathillis in hall heirly remanit, With all welthis at wiss, and worschipe to vale. The Pape begynnis the grace, as greably ganit, to grace. Wosche with thir worthyis, and went to counsall. The pure Howlatis appele completly was planyt, His falt and his foule forme, vnfrely but faile: For the quhilk thir lordis, in leid nocht to layne it, He besocht of sucour, as souerane in saile, That thai wald pray Natur his prent to renewe; present. For it was haile his behest, At thar alleris request, Mycht dame Natur arrest Of him for to rewe. LXVII. Than rewit thir riallis of that rath mane, Baith Spirituale and Temperale, that kend the case; And, considerand the causs, concludit in ane That thai wald Natur beseike, of hir gret grace, To discend that samyn hour as thar souerane, At thar allaris instance, in that ilk place. The Pape and the patriarkis, the prelatis ilkane, Thus pray thai as penitentis, and all that thar was. penitent. Quhar throw dame Natur the trast discendit that tyde, At thar haile instance; Quhom thai ressaif with reuerens, And bowsome obeysance, As Goddess and gyde. LXVIII. \"It nedis nocht,\" quoth Natur, \"to renewe oucht Of &yogh;our entent in this tyde, or forthir to tell; I wait &yogh;our will, and quhat way &yogh;e wald that I wrocht To reforme the Howlat, of faltis full fell.

Than ilk foule of his flicht a fedder has tane, And lent to the Howlat in hast, hartlie but hone. to om . Dame Natur the nobillest nechit in ane, For to ferme this federem, and dewly has done; Gart it ground and growe gayly agane, gaylye and gane. On the samyn Howlat, semely and sone. Than was he schand of his schape, and his schroude schane Off alkyn colour most cleir beldit abone, Of all coloure. The farest foule of the firth, and hendest of hewes; So clene and so colourlyke, colourike. That no bird was him lyke, Fro Burone to Berwike, Fro Byron. Wnder the bewes. LXX. Thus was the Howlat in herde herely at hicht, Flour of all fowlis, throw fedderis so fair, He lukit to his lykame that lemyt so licht, that om . So propir plesand of prent, provde to repar: He thocht him maid on the mold makless of mycht, him om . As souerane him awne self, throw bewte he bair, Counterpalace to the Pape, our princis, I plicht; with the Pape. So hiely he hyit him in Luciferis lair, That all the fowlis of the firth he defowlit syne. Thus leit he no man his peir; Gif ony nech wald him neir, He bad tham rebaldis orere, With a ruyne. LXXI. \"The pape and the patriarkis, and princis of prow, I am cummyn of thar kyn, be cosingage knawin; of thair blud. So fair is my fetherem I haf no falowe; My schrowde and my schene weid schir to be schawin.\" All birdis he rebalkit, that wald him nocht bowe, In breth as a batall-wricht full of bost blawin, With vnloveable latis nocht till allow. unlowable. Thus wycit he the walentyne thraly and thrawin, viciit he the Valan|tene. That all the fowlis with assent assemblit agane, And plen&yogh;eit to Natur Of this intollerable injur; How the Howlat him bure So hie and so haltane. LXXII. So pomposs, impertinat, and reprovable, impertinax. In excess our arrogant, thir birdis ilkane Besocht Natur to cess that vnsufferable. Thar with that lady a lyte leuch hir allane: That with that lady allyt. \"My first making,\" quoth scho, \"was vnamendable, Thocht I alterit, as &yogh;e all askit in ane; &YOGH;it sall I preif &yogh;ow to pleiss, sen it is possible.\" Scho callit the Howlat in haist, that was so haltane: \"Thy pryde,\" quod the Princes, \"approchis our hie Lyke Lucifer in estaite; And sen thow art so elate, As the Ewangelist wrait, Thow sall lawe be.

As scho has demyt thai haf done, thraly in thrang. Thar with dame Natur has to the hevin drawin, Ascendit sone, in my sicht, with solace and sang. And ilk fowle tuke the flicht, schortly to schawin, and schortly. Held hame to thar hant, and thar herbery, Quhar thai war wont to remane; All thir gudly ar gane, gudly and gane. And thar levit allane The Howlat and I. LXXIV. Than this Howlat hidowis of hair and of hyde, Put first fro poverte to pryce, and princis awne per, Syne degradit fra grace, for his gret pryde, Bannyt bitterly his birth bailefull in beir. belfully. He welterit, he wrythit, he waryit the tyde, That he was wrocht in this warld wofull in weir; He crepillit, he crengit, he carfully cryd, He solpit, he sorowit, in sighingis seir. He said, \"Allace! I am lost, lathest of all, Bysyn in baile beft, Bysym. I may be sampill heir eft, That pryde neuer &yogh;it left yit neuir. His feir but a fall. LXXV. \"I couth nocht won in to welth wretch wast, wrech wayest. I was so wantoun of will, my werdis ar wan; in will. Thus for my hicht I am hurt, and harmit in haist, Cairfull and caytif for craft that I can. Quhen I was hewit as heir all thir hieast, I wes of hevit as heir all thill hiest.

In the cheiftyme of Charlis, that chosin chiftane, Thair fell ane ferlyfull flan within thay fellis wyde, Quhair Empreouris and Erlis, and vther monyane, Turnit fra Sanct Thomas befoir the &yogh;ule tyde. Thay past vnto Paris, thay proudest in pane, With mony Prelatis and Princis, that was of mekle pryde; All thay went with the King to his worthy wane; Ouir the feildis sa fair thay fure be his syde; All the worthiest went in the morning, Baith Dukis, and Duchepeiris, Barrounis, and Bacheleiris, Mony stout man steiris Of town with the King. II. \u00b6 And as that Ryall raid ouir the rude mure, Him betyde ane tempest that tyme, hard I tell; The wind blew out of the Eist stiflie and sture, The deip durandlie draif in mony deip dell; Sa feirslie fra the Firmament, sa fellounlie it fure, Thair micht na folk hald na fute on the heich fell. In point thay war to parische, thay proudest men and pure, In thay wickit wedderis thair wist nane to dwell. Amang thay myrk Montanis sa madlie thay mer, Be it was pryme of the day, Sa wonder hard fure thay That ilk ane tuik ane seir way, And sperpellit full fer. III. &rindx; Ithand wedderis of the eist draif on sa fast, It all to-blaisterit and blew that thairin baid. Be thay disseuerit sindrie, midmorne was past; Thair wist na Knicht of the Court quhat way the King raid. He saw thair was na better bot God at the last, His steid aganis the storme staluartlie straid; He Cachit fra the Court, sic was his awin cast, Quhair na body was him about be fiue mylis braid. In thay Montanis, I-wis, he wox all will, In wickit wedderis and wicht, Amang thay Montanis on hicht; Be that it drew to the nicht, The King lykit ill. IV. Euill lykand was the King it nichtit him sa lait, And he na harberie had for his behufe; Sa come thair ane cant Carll chachand the gait, With ane Capill and twa Creillis cuplit abufe. The King carpit to the Carll withoutin debait: \"Schir, tell me thy richt name, for the Rude lufe?\" He sayis: \"Men callis me Rauf Coil&yogh;ear, as I weill wait; I leid my life in this land with mekle vnrufe, Baith tyde and tyme in all my trauale; Hine ouir seuin mylis I dwell, And leidis Coilis to sell; Sen thow speiris, I the tell All the suith hale.\" V. \u00b6 \"Sa mot I thrife,\" said the King, \"I speir for nane ill; Thow semis ane nobill fallow, thy answer is sa fyne.\" \"Forsuith,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear, \"traist quhen thow will, For I trow and it be nocht swa, sum part salbe thyne.\" \"Mary, God forbid,\" said the King, \"that war bot lytill skill; Baith my self and my hors is reddy for to tyne; I pray the, bring me to sum rest, the wedder is sa schill, For I defend that we fall in ony fechtine; I had mekill mair nait sum freindschip to find: And gif thow can better than I, For the name of Sanct July, Thow bring me to sum harbery, And leif me not behind.\" VI. \"I wait na worthie harberie heir neir hand, For to serue sic ane man as me think the, Nane bot mine awin hous, maist in this land, Fer furth in the Forest, amang the fellis hie. With thy thow wald be payit of sic as thow fand, Forsuith thow suld be wel-cum to pas hame with me, Or ony vther gude fallow that I heir fand Walkand will of his way, as me think the; For the wedderis are sa fell, that fallis on the feild.\" fa fell. The King was blyth, quhair he raid, Of the grant that he had maid, Sayand with hart glaid: \"Schir, God &yogh;ow for&yogh;eild.\" VII. \"Na, thank me not ouir airlie, for dreid that we threip, For I haue seruit the &yogh;it of lytill thing to ruse; For nouther hes thow had of me fyre, drink, nor meit, Nor nane vther eismentis for trauellouris behuse; Bot, micht we bring this harberie this nicht weill to heip, That we micht with ressoun baith thus excuse; To-morne on the morning, quhen thow sall on leip, Pryse at the parting, how that thow dois; For first to lofe and syne to lak, Peter! it is schame.\" The King said: \"In gude fay, Schir, it is suith that &yogh;e say.\" Into sic talk fell thay Quhill thay war neir hame. VIII. \u00b6 To the Coil&yogh;earis hous baith, or thay wald blin, The Carll had Cunning weill quhair the gait lay; Cunniug. \"Vndo the dure beliue! Dame, art thow in? Quhy Deuill makis thow na dule for this euill day? For my Gaist and I baith cheueris with the chin, Sa fell ane wedder feld I neuer, be my gude fay.\" The gude wyfe glaid with the gle to begin, For durst scho neuer sit summoundis that scho hard him say: The Carll was wantoun of word, and wox wonder wraith. All abaisit for blame, To the dure went our Dame, Scho said: \"Schir, &yogh;e ar welcome hame, And &yogh;our Gaist baith.\" IX. \u00b6 \"Dame, I haue deir coft all this dayis hyre, In wickit wedderis and weit walkand full will; Dame, kyith I am cummin hame, and kendill on ane fire, I trow our Gaist be the gait hes farne als ill. Ane Ryall rufe het fyre war my desyre, To fair the better for his saik, gif we micht win thair till; Knap doun Capounis of the best, but in the byre, Heir is bot hamelie fair, do beliue, Gill.\" Twa cant knaifis of his awin haistelie he bad: \"The ane of &yogh;ow my Capill ta, The vther his Coursour alswa, To the stabill swyith &yogh;e ga.\" Than was the King glaid. X. &rindx; The Coil&yogh;ear, gudlie in feir, tuke him be the hand, And put him befoir him, as ressoun had bene; Quhen thay come to the dure, the King begouth to stand, To put the Coil&yogh;ear in befoir, maid him to mene. He said: \"Thow art vncourtes, that sall I warrand.\" He tyt the King be the nek, twa part in tene; \"Gif thow at bidding suld be boun or obeysand, And gif thow of Courtasie couth, thow hes for&yogh;et it clene; Now is anis,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear, \"kynd aucht to creip, Sen ellis thow art vnknawin, To mak me Lord of my awin; Sa mot I thriue, I am thrawin, Begin we to threip.\" XI. Than benwart thay &yogh;eid, quhair brandis was bricht, To ane bricht byrnand fyre as the Carll bad; He callit on Gyliane, his wyfe, thair Supper to dicht. \"Of the best that thair is, help that we had, . . . . . Efter ane euill day to haue ane mirrie nicht, For sa troublit with stormis was I neuer stad; Of ilk airt of the Eist sa laithly it laid, &YOGH;it was I mekle willar than, Quhen I met with this man.\" Of sic taillis thay began, Quhill the supper was graid. XII. \u00b6 Sone was the Supper dicht, and the fyre bet, And thay had weschin, I wis, the worthiest was thair: \"Tak my wyfe be the hand, in feir, withoutin let, And gang begin the buird,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear. \"That war vnsemand, forsuith, and thy self vnset;\" The King profferit him to gang, and maid ane strange fair. \"Now is twyse,\" said the Carll, \"me think thow hes for&yogh;et.\" He leit gyrd to the King, withoutin ony mair, And hit him vnder the eir with his richt hand, Quhill he stakkerit thair with all Half the breid of the hall; He faind neuer of ane fall, Quhill he the eird fand. XIII. \u00b6 He start vp stoutly agane, vneis micht he stand, For anger of that outray that he had thair tane. He callit on Gyliane his wyfe: \"Ga, tak him be the hand, And gang agane to the buird, quhair &yogh;e suld air haue gane.\" \"Schir, thow art vnskilfull, and that sall I warrand, Thow byrd to haue nurtour aneuch, and thow hes nane; Thow hes walkit, I wis, in mony wyld land, The mair vertew thow suld haue, to keip the fra blame; Thow suld be courtes of kynd, and ane cunnand Courteir. Thocht that I simpill be, Do as I bid the, The hous is myne, pardie, And all that is heir.\" XIV. &rindx; The King said to him self: \"This is an euill lyfe, &YOGH;it was I neuer in my lyfe thus gait leird; And I haue oft tymes bene quhair gude hes bene ryfe, That maist couth of courtasie in this Cristin eird. Is nane sa gude as leif of, and mak na mair stryfe, For I am stonischit at this straik, that hes me thus steird.\" In feir fairlie he foundis, with the gude wyfe, Quhair the Coil&yogh;ear bad, sa braithlie he beird. Quhen he had done his bidding, as him gude thocht, Doun he sat the King neir, And maid him glaid and gude cheir, And said: \"&YOGH;e ar welcum heir, Be him that me bocht.\" XV. \u00b6 Quhen thay war seruit and set to the Suppar, Gyll and the gentill King, Charlis of micht, Syne on the tother syde sat the Coil&yogh;ear: Thus war thay marschellit but mair, and matchit that nicht. Thay brocht breid to the buird, and braun of ane bair, And the worthyest wyne went vpon hicht; Thay Beirnis, as I wene, thay had aneuch thair, Within that burelie bigging, byrnand full bricht; Syne enteris thair daynteis on deis dicht dayntelie. Within that worthie wane Forsuith wantit thay nane. With blyith cheir sayis Gyliane: \"Schir, dois glaidlie.\" XVI. &rindx; The Carll carpit to the King cumlie and cleir: \"Schir, the Forestaris, forsuith, of this Forest, Thay haue me all at Inuy for dreid of the Deir; Thay threip that I thring doun of the fattest; Thay say, I sall to Paris, thair to compeir Befoir our cumlie King, in dule to be drest; Sic manassing thay me mak, forsuith, ilk &yogh;eir, And &yogh;it aneuch sall I haue for me and ane Gest; Thairfoir sic as thow seis, spend on, and not spair.\" Thus said gentill Charlis the Mane To the Coil&yogh;ear agane: \"The King him self hes bene fane Sum tyme of sic fair.\" XVII. \u00b6 Of Capounis and Cunningis thay had plentie, With wyne at thair will, and eik Vennysoun; Byrdis bakin in breid, the best that may be; Thus full freschlie thay fure into fusioun. The Carll with ane cleir voce carpit on he, Said: \"Gyll, lat the cop raik for my bennysoun; And gar our Gaist begin, and syne drink thow to me; Sen he is ane stranger, me think it ressoun.\" Thay drank dreichlie about, thay wosche, and thay rais. The King with ane blyith cheir Thankit the Coil&yogh;eir; Syne all the thre into feir To the fyre gais. XVIII. Quhen thay had maid thame eis, the Coil&yogh;ear tald Mony sindrie taillis efter Suppair. Ane bricht byrnand fyre was byrnand full bald; The King held gude countenance and company bair, And euer to his asking ane answer he &yogh;ald; Quhill at the last he began to frane farther mair: \"In faith, freind, I wald wit, tell gif &yogh;e wald, Quhair is thy maist wynning?\" said the Coil&yogh;ear. \"Out of weir,\" said the King, \"I wayndit neuer to tell; With my Lady the Quene In office maist haue I bene All thir &yogh;eiris fyftene, In the Court for to dwell.\" XIX. \u00b6 \"Quhat kin office art thow in, quhen thow art at hame, Gif thow dwellis with the Quene, proudest in pane?\" \"Ane Chyld of hir Chalmer, Schir, be Sanct Jame, And thocht my self it say, maist inwart of ane; For my dwelling to nicht I dreid me for blame.\" \"Quhat sal I cal the,\" said the coil&yogh;ear, \"quhen thow art hyne gane?\" \"Wymond of the Wardrop is my richt Name, Quhair euer thow findis me befoir the, thi harberie is tane. And thow will cum to the Court, this I vnderta, Thow sall haue for thy Fewaill, For my saik, the better saill, And onwart to thy trauaill, Worth ane laid or twa.\" XX. \u00b6 He said: \"I haue na knawledge quhair the Court lyis, And I am wonder wa to cum quhair I am vnkend.\" \"And I sall say thee the suith on ilk syde, I wis, That thow sall wit weill aneuch or I fra the wend. Baith the King and the Quene meitis in Paris, For to hald thair &YOGH;ule togidder, for scho is efter send. Thair may thow sell, be ressoun, als deir as thow will prys; And &yogh;it I sall help the, gif I ocht may amend, For I am knawin with Officiaris in cais thow cum thair; Haue gude thocht on my Name, And speir gif I be at hame, For I suppois, be Sanct Jame, Thow sall the better fair.\" XXI. \u00b6 \"Me think it ressoun, be the Rude, that I do thy rid, In cais I cum to the Court, and knaw bot the ane. Is nane sa gude as drink, and gang to our bed, For als far as I wait, the nicht is furth gane.\" To ane preuie Chalmer beliue thay him led, Quhair ane burely bed was wrocht in that wane, Closit with Courtingis, and cumlie cled; Of the worthiest wyne wantit thay nane. The Coil&yogh;ear and his wyfe baith with him thay &yogh;eid, To serue him all at thay mocht, Till he was in bed brocht. Mair the King spak nocht, Bot thankit thame thair deid. XXII. &rindx; Vpon the morne airlie, quhen it was day, The King buskit him sone with scant of Squyary. Wachis and Wardroparis all war away, That war wont for to walkin mony worthy. Ane Pauyot preuilie brocht him his Palfray, The King thocht lang of this lyfe, and lap on in hy; Than callit he on the Carll, anent quhair he lay, For to tak his leif, than spak he freindly; Than walkinnit thay baith, and hard he was thair. The Carll start vp sone, And prayit him to abyde none; \"Quhill thir wickit wedderis be done, I rid nocht &yogh;e fair.\" XXIII. \"Sa mot I thriue,\" said the King, \"me war laith to byde; Is not the morne &YOGH;ule day, formest of the &yogh;eir? Ane man that Office suld beir be tyme at this tyde, He will be found in his fault, that wantis foroutin weir. I se the Firmament fair vpon ather syde, I will returne to the Court quhill the wedder is cleir; Call furth the gude wyfe, lat pay hir or we ryde, For the worthie harberie that I haue fundin heir.\" hane. \"Lat be, God forbid,\" the Coil&yogh;ear said, \"And thow of Charlis cumpany, Cheif King of Cheualry, That for ane nichtis harbery Pay suld be laid.\" XXIV. \u00b6 \"&YOGH;ea, sen it is sa that thow will haue na pay, Cum the morne to the Court and do my counsall; Deliuer the, and bring ane laid, and mak na delay, Thow may not schame with thy craft, gif thow thriue sall; Gif I may help the ocht to sell, forsuith I sall assay, And als my self wald haue sum of the Fewall.\" \"Peter!\" he said, \"I sall preif the morne, gif I may, To bring Coillis to the Court, to se gif thay sell sall.\" \"Se that thow let nocht, I pray the,\" said the King. \"In faith,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear, \"Traist weill I salbe thair, For thow will neuer gif the mair, To mak ane lesing.\" XXV. \"Bot tell me now, lelely, quhat is thy richt name?

Than the Coil&yogh;ear had greit thocht on the cunnand he had maid, Went to the Charcoill in hy, To mak his Chauffray reddy; Agane the morne airly He ordanit him ane laid. XXVI. \u00b6 The lyft lemit vp beliue, and licht was the day; The King had greit knawledge the countrie to ken. Schir Rolland and Oliuer come rydand the way, With thame ane thousand and ma of fensabill men War wanderand all the nicht ouir, and mony ma than thay, On ilk airt outwart war ordanit sic ten; Gif thay micht heir of the King, or happin quhair he lay, To Jesus Christ thay pray, that grace thame to len. Als sone as Schir Rolland saw it was the King, He kneillit doun in the place, Thankand God ane greit space; Thair was ane meting of grace At that gaddering. XXVII. The gentill Knicht, Schir Rolland, he kneilit on his kne, Thankand greit God that mekill was of micht; Schir Oliuer at his hand, and Bischoppis thre, Withoutin commounis that come, and mony vther Knicht. Than to Paris thay pas, all that Cheualrie, Betuix none of the day and &YOGH;ule nicht: The gentill Bischop Turpine cummand thay se, With threttie Conuent of Preistis reuest at ane sicht, Preichand of Prophecie in Processioun. Efter thame, baith fer and neir, Folkis following in feir, Thankand God with gude cheir Thair Lord was gane to toun. XXVIII. &rindx; Quhen thay Princis appeirit into Paris, Ilk Rew Ryallie with riches thame arrayis; Thair was Digne seruice done at Sanct Dyonys, With mony proud Prelat, as the buik sayis. Syne to Supper thay went within the Palys, Befoir that mirthfull man menstrallis playis; Mony wicht wyfis sone, worthie and wise, Was sene at that semblay ane and twentie dayis; With all kin principall plentie for his plesance. Thay callit it the best &YOGH;ule than, And maist worthie began, Sen euer King Charlis was man, Or euer was in France. XXIX. \u00b6 Than vpon the morne airlie, quhen the day dew, The Coil&yogh;ear had greit thocht quhat he had vnder tane; He kest twa Creillis on ane Capill with Coillis anew, Wandit thame with widdeis, to wend on that wane. \"Mary, it is not my counsall, bot &yogh;one man that &yogh;e knew, To do &yogh;ow in his gentrise,\" said Gyliane. \"Thow gaif him ane outragious blaw and greit boist blew; In faith, thow suld haue bocht it deir, and he had bene allane. For thy, hald &yogh;ow fra the Court, for ocht that may be: &YOGH;one man that thow outrayd Is not sa simpill as he said; Thairun my lyfe dar I layd, That sall thow heir and se.\" XXX. &rindx; \"&YOGH;ea, Dame, haue nane dreid of my lyfe to day, Lat me wirk as I will, the weird is mine awin.

XXXI. \u00b6 Graith thocht of the grant had the gude King, And callit Schir Rolland him till and gaif commandment, Ane man he traistit in, maist atour all vther thing, That neuer wald set him on assay withoutin his assent: \"Tak thy hors and thy harnes in the morning, For to watche weill the wayis, I wald that thow went; Gif thow meitis ony leid lent on the ling, Gar thame boun to this Burgh, I tell the mine Intent; Or gyf thow seis ony man cumming furth the way, Quhat sumeuer that he be, Bring him haistely to me, Befoir none that I him se In this hall the day.\" XXXII. \u00b6 Schir Rolland had greit ferly, and in hart kest Quhat that suld betakin that the King tald; Vpon Solempnit &YOGH;ule day quhen ilk man suld rest, That him behouit neidlingis to watche on the wald, Quhen his God to serue he suld haue him drest; And syne, with ane blyith cheir, buskit that bald. Out of Paris proudly he preikit full prest Intill his harnes all haill his hechtis for to hald; He vmbekest the countrie outwith the toun; He saw na thing on steir, Nouther fer nor neir, Bot the feildis in feir, Daillis and doun. XXXIII. \u00b6 He huit and he houerit, quhill midmorne and mair, Behaldand the hie hillis, and passage sa plane; Sa saw he quhair the Coil&yogh;ear come with all his fair, With twa Creillis on ane Capill; thairof was he fane. He followit to him haistely among the holtis hair, For to bring him to the King, at bidding full bane. Courtesly to the Knicht kneillit the Coil&yogh;ear; And Schir Rolland him self salust him agane, Syne bad him leif his courtasie and boun him to ga. He said: \"Withoutin letting, Thow mon to Paris to the King, Speid the fast in ane ling, Sen I find na ma.\" XXXIV. \u00b6 \"In faith,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear, \"&yogh;it was I neuer sa nyse, Schir Knicht, it is na courtasie commounis to scorne; Thair is mony better than I cummis oft to Parys, That the King wait not of, nouther nicht nor morne.

Thair is mony Carll in the countrie thow may nocht ken; I sall hald that I haue hecht, bot I be hard set, To Wymond of the Wardrop, I wait full weill quhen.\" \"Sa thriue I,\" said Rolland, \"it is mine Intent, That nouther to Wymond nor Will Thow sall hald nor hecht till, Quhill I haue brocht the to fulfill The Kingis commandment.\" XXXVI. \u00b6 The Carll beheld to the Knicht, as he stude than; He bair grauit in Gold and Gowlis in grene, Glitterand full gaylie quhen Glemis began, Ane Tyger ticht to ane tre, ane takin of tene. Trewlie that tenefull was trimland than, Semelie schapin and schroud in that Scheild schene; Mekle worschip of weir worthylie he wan, Befoir, into fechting with mony worthie sene. His Basnet was bordourit and burneist bricht With stanis of Beriall deir, Dyamountis and Sapheir, Riche Rubeis in feir, Reulit full richt. XXXVII. His plaitis properlie picht attour with precious stanis, And his Pulanis full prest of that ilk peir; Greit Graipis of Gold his Greis for the nanis, And his Cussanis cumlie schynand full cleir; Bricht braissaris of steill about his arme banis, Blandit with Beriallis and Cristallis cleir; Ticht ouir with Thopas, and trew lufe atanis; The teind of his iewellis to tell war full teir. tewellis. His Sadill circulit and set, richt sa on ilk syde, His brydill bellisand and gay His steid stout on stray, He was the Ryallest of array, On Ronsy micht ryde. XXXVIII. \u00b6 Of that Ryall array that Rolland in raid, Rauf rusit in his hart of that Ryall thing: \"He is the gayest in geir that euer on ground glaid, Haue he grace to the gre in ilk Iornaying; War he ane manly man, as he is weill maid, He war full michtie, with magre durst abyde his meting.\" He bad the Coil&yogh;ear in wraith swyth withoutin baid Cast the Creillis fra the Capill, and gang to the King. \"In faith, it war greit schame,\" said the Coil&yogh;ear, \"I vndertuk thay suld be brocht, vndertak.

The gentill Knicht, Schir Rolland, come rydand full sone, And left the Coil&yogh;ear to cum, as he had vndertane; And quhen he come to Paris, the hie Mes was done, The King with mony cumly out of the Kirk is gane. Of his harnes in hy he hynt withoutin hone, And in ane Rob him arrayit richest of ane; In that worschipfull weid he went in at none, As he was wont, with the wy that weildit the wane, On fute ferly in feir, formest of all.

Derfly ouir Daillis discouerand the doun, Gif ony douchtie that day for Iornayis was dicht; He band his blonk to ane busk on the bent broun, Syne baid be the bair way to hald that he had hecht. Quhill it was neir time of the day that he had thair bene, He lukit ane lytill him fra, He sa cummand in thra The maist man of all tha That euer he had sene. LXIII. \u00b6 Ane Knicht on ane Cameill come cantly at hand, With ane curagious countenance and cruell to se. He semit baldly to abyde with Birny and with brand, His blonk was vnburely, braid and ouir hie. Schir Rauf reddyit him sone, and come rydand, And in the rowme of ane renk in fewtir kest he; He seimit fer fellonar than first quhen he him fand, He foundis throw his forcenes gif he micht him se; He straik the steid with the spurris, he sprent on the bent. Sa hard ane cours maid thay, That baith thair hors deid lay; Thair speiris in splenders away Abufe thair heid sprent. LXIV. \u00b6 Thus war thay for thair forcynes left on fute baith, Thay sture hors at that straik strikin deid lay than. Thir riche restles renkis ruschit out full raith, Cleikit out twa swordis and togidder ran. Kest thame with gude will to do vther skaith, Baft on thair basnetis thay Beirnis or thay blan. Haistely hewit thay togiddir, to leif thay war laith To tyne the worschip of weir that thay air wan; Na for dout of vincussing thay went nocht away. Thus ather vther can assaill With swordis of mettaill; Thay maid ane lang battail, Ane hour of the day. LXV. \u00b6 Thay hard harnest men, thay hewit on in haist, Thay worthit heuy with heid, and angerit with all; Quhill thay had maid thame sa mait, thay fail&yogh;e almaist, Sa laith thay war on ather part to lat thair price fall; The riche restles men out of the renk past, Forwrocht with thair wapnis, and euill rent with all. Thair was na girth on the ground, quhill ane gaif the gaist; \"&YOGH;arne efter &yogh;eilding,\" on ilk syde thay call.

LXVI. \u00b6 \"Now, be the Rude,\" said Schir Rauf, \"I repreif the! Thow hes brokin conditioun, thow hes not done richt: Thow hecht na bak heir to bring, bot anerly we; bakheir. Thairto I tuik thy hand, as thow was trew Knicht.\" On loud said the Sara&yogh;ine: \"I heir the now lie! Befoir the same day I saw the neuer with sicht; Now sall thow think it richt sone, thow hes met with me, Gif Mahoun or Termagant may mantene my micht.\" Schir Rauf was blyth of that word and blenkit with his face: \"Thow sayis thow art ane Sara&yogh;ine, Now thankit be Drichtine, That ane of vs sall neuer hine Vndeid in this place.\" LXVII. \u00b6 Then said the Sara&yogh;ine to Schir Rauf succudrously: \"I haue na lyking to lyfe to lat the with lufe.\" He gaue ane braid with his brand to the Beirne by, Till the blude of his browis brest out abufe. The kene Knicht in that steid stakkerit sturely, The lenth of ane rude braid he gart him remufe; Schir Rauf ruschit vp agane, and hit him in hy. Thay preis furth properly thair pithis to prufe. Ilk ane a schort knyfe braidit out sone, In stour stifly thay stand, With twa knyfis in hand; With that come Schir Rolland As thay had neir done. LXVIII. The gentill Knicht Schir Rolland come rydand ful richt, And ruschit fra his Runsy, and ran thame betwene; He sayis: \"Thow art ane Sara&yogh;ine, I se be my sicht, For to confound our Cristin men that counteris sa kene; Tell me thy name tyte, thow trauelland Knicht!

Thay Knichtis caryit to the court, as Christ had thame kend. The King for thair cumming maid game and gle, With mony mirthfull man thair mirthis to mend. Digne Bischoppis that day, that douchtie gart bring, And gaue him Sacramentis seir, And callit him Schir Gawteir, And sine the Duches cleir He weddit with ane ring. LXXV. \u00b6 Than Schir Rauf gat rewaird to keip his Knichtheid; Sic tythingis come to the King within thay nyne nicht, That the Marschell of France was newlingis deid; Richt thair, with the counsall of mony kene Knicht, He thocht him richt worthie to byde in his steid, For to weild that worschip worthie and wicht. His wyfe wald he nocht for&yogh;et, for dout of Goddis feid.
