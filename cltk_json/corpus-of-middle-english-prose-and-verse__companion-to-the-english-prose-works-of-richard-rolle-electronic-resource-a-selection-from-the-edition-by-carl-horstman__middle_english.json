[XXV.] \u00b6 Before euensange sall \u00feou thynke of Ihesu passione\nand of his supere.  Of \u00fee passione sall \u00feou thynke how Ioseph of Aramathy\npurchaste Ihesu body of Pilate, and how \u00feey come to \u00fee crosse \u00feare he hange, and\n\u00feay brakke \u00fee twa thee-banes of \u00fee twa thefes.  And \u00feare was a knyghte redye\nwith a spere, and perchede \u00fee syde of Ihesu, and smate hym to \u00fee herte; and\nals-sone come rynnande downe \u00fee precyouse blode and watire.

And \u00feare-fore \u00feare whare we\nsulde hafe vgglynes als vn-till oure body for to ete flesche and drynke blude of\nmane, oure lorde Ihesu Criste turnede his flesche and his blude in liknes of brede\nand of wyne, for to comforthe oure bodily witte thurghe swylke fude als we ere\nwonnte for to see, and alswa for to helpe oure trouthe, thurghe \u00feat \u00feat we see\na thynge and trowes ano\u00feer.  And \u00feare-fore, dere frende, whene \u00feou sall gaa\nfor to reschaife \u00feat swete flesche and \u00feat blude of Ihesu thi saueour, luke at \u00feou\nhaue verray contricyone and repentance and clensynge of thi syne in thi herte,\nffor \u00feare \u00feou ressayfes in sacrament reghte als \u00feou ressayfede hyme in flesche\nand blude, bescede be \u00feat grace!  [XXVI.] \u00b6 Be-fore complyne sall \u00feou thynke how\n\u00feat Ioseph and Nicodemus wande Ihesu body in faire schetis, and enoynte it with\nprecyouse oynementes, and laide it in a monumente of stane, and [\u00fee Jewes] sett \u00feaire\nseles apone \u00fee stane, and knyghtes \u00feat sulde it kepe.  The to\u00feer thynge \u00feat \u00feou\nsall thynke in \u00fee same tyme es \u00feis: how Ihesus in \u00fee daye of supere, when he\nhad souppede, he &yogh;ode in till a gardyne with his discyples, and felle downe in\nOrysoune, and byganne for to swete one swylke manere \u00feat \u00fee droppis of blode\ndroppede of his blyssede face vn-till \u00fee erthe.  [XXVII.] // Now hase \u00feou matire and\nmanere for to thynke of goddis manhede.  And eftirwarde sall \u00feou wit how \u00feou\nsall thynke one hym in his heghe godhede.  \u00b6 To \u00feat, sall \u00feou wit \u00feat godde\ntemperde swa his knaweynge fra \u00fee begynnynge of mankynde, \u00feat he walde noghte\nall hally schewe hym to mane, ne all hally hele hyme fra mane; ffor if he hade\nall hally schewede hym to mane, \u00fean hadde trouthe noghte bene worthe and\nmysbileue had noghte bene \u00feane ouercomene, ffor trouthe es of thynge \u00feat may\nnoghte be sene, \u00fean \u00feat at I see es noghte trouthe; and if he had all hallily\nhelede [hym] fra mane, \u00fean had trouthe noghte bene helpede, and mysbileue hade\nbene excusede; and for-thi \u00feane walde he in party schewe hyme, and in party hele\nhyme.  Bot now may \u00feou aske me in how many maners he walde schewe hyme.  I\nsay in twa maners, ane with-In, ano\u00feer with-owttene.

What difference is be-twixe desyr & \u00fee loue of god. Cap o . [x]vi o . But nou askest \u00feou whe\u00feer \u00feis desyre be \u00fee loue of god.  As to \u00feis, I say\n\u00feat \u00feis desyre is not propurli loue, but hit is a begynnyng & a tastyng of loue.\nFor loue is propurli ful couplyng of \u00fee louer & \u00fee loued to-geder as god & a\nsoul in on.  \u00deis couplyng may not be had fully in \u00feis lyf, but only in disyre & longyng \u00feerto; as &yogh;if a man loue a no\u00feur w&yogh;uch is absent, he disyre\u00fe gretly his\n\n\n \n\npresence, for to haue \u00fee vse of his loue & his lykyng.

Be \u00fee w&yogh;uche we schal be saaf, ffor hit is loue\nvnto him as hit may be had here.  \u00deus seide seint Poul: Scientes quia dum sumus in hoc corpore peregrinamur a domino, per fidem enim ambulamus et non per speciem; audemus autem & bonam voluntatem habemus magis peregrinari a corpore & presentes esse ad deum; et ideo contendimus, siue absentes siue presentes, placere illi.

[Beginning] Ed. J. Notary, 1507 This is a deuout boke compyled by mayster Walter Hylton to a deuout man\nin temperal estate, how he sholde rule hym. \u00b6 How a man \u00feat wol be ghostly must fyrst vsen moche bodyly exercyse\nin penaunce and destroyenge of synne: Cap. Primum. DEre brother in Cryst, two maner of states there are in holy chyrche by \u00fee\nwhiche crysten soules plesen god & geten hem the blysse of heuen; that one is\nbodyly, & that other is ghostly.  Bodyly werkyng longeth pryncypally to worldly\n\n\n \n\nmen & wymen the whiche lefully vsen worldly goodes, & wylfully vsen worldly\nbesynes.  Also it longeth to all yonge begynnynge men the whiche comen newe\nout of worldly synnes to the seruyce of god; for to make hem able to ghostly\nwerkyng & for to breke downe the vnbuxumnes of the body by dyscrecyon [and\nsuche] bodyly werkynge, \u00feat it myght be suple & redy, & not mekyl contraryous\nto the spyryte in ghostly werkynge.  For [as] saynt poul sayth, as woman was made\nfor man & not man for woman, ryght so bodyly werkynge was made for ghostly\n& not ghostly for bodyly.  Bodyly werkynge goth before & ghostly comyth after;\nas saynt Poul sayth: \u00b6 Non prius quod spirituale, sed quod animale, deinde [quod] spirituale. And this is a cause why it behoueth to be so: for we are borne in synne and corrupcyon of the flesshe by the whyche we are soo blynded & so ouerlayed \u00feat we haue neyther the ghostly knowyng of god by lyghte of vnderstondynge, ne ghostly felynge of hym by clene desyre of louynge. & therfore we may not sodeynly sterte out of this derke nyght of this flesshly corrupcyon into \u00feat ghostly lyght; for we maye not suffre it ne bere it for syknes of ourself, no more than we may with our bodyly eyen whan they are sore beholde the\nlyght of the son. & therfore we must abyde & werke be processe of tyme.\nFyrst by bodely werkes besily tyl we be dyscharged of this heuy burden of synne\nwhiche lettyth vs fro ghostly werkyng; & tyl our soule be somwhat clensed fro\ngrete outwarde synnes & abled to ghostly werke.  By this bodily werkynge [that]\nI speke of mayst thou vnderstonde al maner of god werkis \u00feat thy soule doth\nby \u00fee wyttes & \u00fee membris of thy body, vnto thyself as in fastyng, waking, & in\nrestraynyng of flesshly lustes by penaunce doyng, or to thyn euencristen be\nfulfyllyng of \u00fee dedes of mercy bodyly or ghostly, or vnto god be sufferynge of al\nbodely myscheues for \u00fee loue of ryghtwysnes. / Al thyse werkes done in trouthe\nby charyte plesen god; withoute whiche they are nought.  Than who so desyreth\nfor to be occupyed ghostly, it is syker & profitable to hym \u00feat he be fyrst wel\nasayed a longe tyme in this bodely werkynge, for thyse bodely dedes are a token\n& a shewyng of moral vertues, withouten whiche a soule is not able for to werke\nghostly.  Breke down fyrst pryde in bodely beryng & also within thin hert\nthynkyng, bostyng & praysyng of [thyselfe and of thy dedis, presumyng of]\nthyself [&] vayn lykyng in thyself of onythyng \u00feat god hath sent to the bodely\nor ghostly.  Breke downe also enuye & yre ageynst thyn euencrysten whether\n\n\n \n\nthey be riche or pore, gode or bad, that thou hate hym not ne haue dysdeyne of\nhym wylfully neyther in worde ne in dede.

The grace & \u00fee goodnes &c. [Conclusion] And therfore the wyse man sayth in an other place on this wyse: Altiora te ne quesieris, et fortiora te ne scrutatus fueris , that is for to saye: \u00bbhygh thynges that are aboue thy wytte and thy reason seke not, & greate thynges that are aboue thy myght ransake not\u00ab.  By these wordes the wyse man forbedeth not vtterly for to seke and ransake ghostly and heuenly thynges, but he forbyddeth vs that as longe as we are flesshely and not clensed fro vayne loue of the worlde, that we take not vpon vs by our owne trauayle ne by our owne wytte for to ransake or to fele ghostly thynges; ne thoughe we fele ghostlye thyngys and grete feruour of \u00fee loue of god so moche [that] we set at nought all erthly thynges and vs thynketh that we wolde for goddes loue forsake all the Ioyes and [all] the welth of this worlde, yet are we not anone able to redy for to seke and beholde ghostly thynges that are aboue vs, vntyll our soule be made sotyll & tyll it be made sadde & stable in vertues by processe of tyme and encreasynge of grace.  For as saynt Gregory sayth: no man sodenly is made souerayne in grace, but fro lytell he begynneth and by processe wexeth vntyll he be perfyte.

Amen. A \u00b6 How eche man sholde desyre to loue god. AMonge all creatures that euer god of his endeles myght made / was there none \u00feat he so loued as he dyd mankynde / whom he made [to reioyce] euerlastynge blysse in stede of aungels / whiche dyd fal from blysse downe in to helle. But that good god loued so man / that for as moche as man had forfeyted that blysse thorugh synne of Adam / he of his plenteuous charyte became man / to bye body and soule that was lost.  In what maner he bought vs / euery crysten man knoweth or sholde knowe: / that no lasse pryce / but suffred his owne precyous body to be all to-rente with bytter paynes of scorgynge.  He suffred also a garlonde of sharpe thornes pressyd to his heed / whiche percyd so the veynes that the blood ran doune in to his eyen / nose / mouth & eeres.  Afterwarde vpon the crosse his bones were drawe out of Ioynte / the veynes & the senewes were borsten for strayte drawynge / to \u00fee crosse he was nayled honde & foot / and so fayled the blood of kynd with bytter paynes of deth.  He betoke his spyryte to the fader of heuen / and than suffred at the last his gloryous herte to be thorugh-percyd with a sharpe spere for to gyue his herte-blood to bye man body and soule into Ioye without ende.  \u00b6 Yf god of his grete goodnes loued thus man, gyuynge hym ouer this wytte and reason and all other thynge that hym nedeth: / kyndely a man sholde nyght and daye with all his wyttes loue hym, and feruentely desyre to conne loue suche a good god that all thynge made, all thynge gyueth and susteyneth.  Of this desyre there ben many, men and women, whiche haue full grete lykynge to speke of the loue of god / and all daye\n\n\n \n\naskyne how they sholde loue god & in what maner they sholde l[y]ue to his pleasaunce for his endeles goodnes.  To suche men & women, of that good wyll and [of] thatholy desyre, I wyll shewe fyrste of holy men before this tyme how feruent some were in the loue of god, Also in how hyghe a degree some were vysyted in \u00fee swetenes [of \u00fee loue] of cryst.  But it may be so that it is full harde for the more partye of men & women to come to so hyghe a degree of loue / therfore after the shewynge of suche hyghe degrees of loue somwhat I wyll wryte to other of symple knowynge how they sholde loue god / as that gracyous god wyll gyue me grace. B \u00b6 How men somtyme loued god / & how holy men somtyme were vysyted with swetenes in the loue of almyghty god. I Fynde & rede of oure holy faders in olde tyme that for the loue of god they forsoke the worlde and all worldely thynges and lyued in wyldernes by grasse & by rotes / suche men were feruent in the loue of god.  But I trowe there ben but fewe or elles none that folowen them now / for we fynde not by goddes lawe or heste that we sholde l[y]ue so.  For all-be-it they were kepte & susteyned so moost by the myght and grace of god / as no goodnes may be without hym: yet I trowe they lyued so moche by \u00fee strength of kynde that was in man tho dayes.  I wyll not counseyll the to lyue as they dyde / for thou mayst by other maner lyuynge come to the loue of god / as thou shalt se afterwarde.  \u00b6 I fynde also furthermore of other ful holy men of ryght late tyme whiche lyueden a ful holy lyfe, and toke theyr lyuelode as feblenesse of man asketh now in our dayes.  Some of these men as I haue herde and redde were vysyted by the grace of god with a passynge swetenes of the loue of cryste / whiche swetenes for an example they shewed afterwarde by theyr wrytynge to other men folowynge / yf ony wolde trauayle to haue that hyghe desyre or degree of loue.  This loue whiche they haue wryten to other is departed in thre degrees of loue / whiche thre degrees they hadden one after an other, standynge stablysshed in theyr desyre / and suffrynge pacyently for the loue of god many trybulacyons & temptacyons tyll they come by holy contemplacyon to \u00fee hyghest degre of loue of tho thre.  By this I suppose he that hath grace to come to the fyrst may by goddes helpe come to the seconde / & so with a feruent desyre & good perseueraunce he may come to the thyrde.  Shortely I wyll shewe here these degrees of loue / for [percase] all men and women that sholde rede this haue not knowynge of theym / ne neuer herde speke of suche degrees of loue before-tyme.     \u00b6 Degrees of hyghe loue.     .I.  \u00b6 The fyrste loue is so feruent that no-thynge whiche is contrary to goddes wyll may ouercome that loue / welth ne wo, helthe ne sykenes; Also he \u00feat hath this loue wyl not make god ones angry for all the worlde withoute ende / but rather suffre all the payne that myght come to ony creature than ones wylfully dysplease his god in thought or [in] dede. .II.  \u00b6 The seconde loue is more feruent, for \u00feat is so stronge / that what man loueth in that degre, all his thought, herte & myght is so entyerly, so besely & so perfyghtly stablysshed in Ihesu cryste that his thought cometh neuer from hym\n\n\n \n\nbut [only] whan he slepeth.     .III.  \u00b6 The thyrde degre of loue is hyghest and moost wonderfull / for what man cometh to that loue / all comforte and all solace is closed oute of his herte / but onely the Ioye of Ihesu cryste / Other Ioye may his herte not receyue, for swetnesse that he hath of the Ioye euermore lastynge.  This loue is so brennynge & so gladynge that who so hath that loue may as well fele the fyer of brennynge loue in his soule / as an other man may fele his fynger brenne in erthely fyre.  This loue may well be called a brennynge loue.     And yf men had suche swetnesse in the loue of god of so late tyme, I suppose wel \u00feat \u00fee same we may haue now by the gyfte of god yf we were as feruent in loue as they were.  But these degrees of loue ben set vpon so hyghe loue to god / that what man sholde haue the fyrst of these thre / behoued that he were a sad contemplatyf man or woman, And by cause mankynde is now & euermore the lenger the febler or perauenture more vnstable / therfore vnethes sholde we fynde now a sad contemplatyfe man or woman.  Men of relygyon haue taken dyuerse habytes of contemplatyf lyfe; Men & women also that ben enclosed, as it semeth lyuen a contemplatyfe lyfe / & so with goddes grace they do for the more partye: But for to speke of hyghe contemplatyfe lyfe as holy men lyued before this tyme, it semeth there ben ryght fewe.  Therfore I trowe that I may sykerly say that fewe there ben now that wyl or may trauayle now to haue suche hyghe degrees of loue as I haue reherced before.  Neuertheles what so euer thou be that redest or herest this / be neuer [\u00fee] slower to trauayll. For yf thy desyre be sette feruently & lowly, holdynge the vnworthy to haue so hyghe a ghoostly gyfte before an other man / & puttest thy desyre to goddes dysposycyon trustyngly, he wyll dyspose that is best for the / whether thou haste thy desyre or haue it not.  But it is fyrst nedefull to \u00fee that thou haue other thre degrees of loue that the same holy men wrote in theyr treatyse / whiche be not of so hyghe a degree as tho that be reherced before.     .I.  \u00b6 The fyrst degree of these is / whan a man or a woman holdeth the commaundementes of god & kepeth hym-selfe out of dedely synne / & is stable in the fayth of holy chyrche.  Also whan a man wolde not for none erthely thynge dysplease god / but truly standeth in his degree whether he be religyous or seculer.  In this maner euery man behoueth to loue his god that wyll be saued: / therfore I counseyll the to haue & kepe this loue or thou clymbe to ony hyer degree. .II.  \u00b6 The seconde degree is whan a man forsaketh all the worlde for the loue of god / that is for to saye his fader, his moder & all his kynred, & foloweth cryst in pouerte.  Also studieth nyght & daye / how clene he may be in herte, howe chaste in body / how meke & buxom / howe clene in all vertues / & hate all vyces / soo that all his lyfe be ghoostly & none thynge flesshely.     .III.  \u00b6 The thyrde degree is hyghest / for that is a ful contemplatyfe lyfe, as whan a man or a woman loueth for to be alone from all maner noyse.  And whan that he is saddely sette in this lyfe and in this loue, with his ghoostly eyen than may he se in to the blysse of heuen; And than his eyen be soo enlumyned and so clere lyghted with grace of ghoostly loue, and also thrugh-kyndeled with the gracyous fyre of crystes loue, that he shall haue a maner of brennynge loue in\n\n\n \n\nhis herte euermore lastynge, and his thought euermore vpwarde to god.  \u00b6 Thus as I haue reherced god hath vysyted his seruauntes, gyuynge theym a specyall sauour to loue hym by theyr holy lyuynge.  Many other men and women there be whiche please god full well standynge truely in theyr degree as men & women of the worlde / both lordes & ladyes & other husbonde men women & wyues. For al be it they may not come to suche hye contemplatyfe lyfe, it suffyseth [to] them to haue the fyrst degree of these thre whiche I reherced last / for that euery man is bounde to kepe.  \u00b6 \u00b6 Yf thou desyre to haue an hygher degre of loue in to the worshyp of god / trauayle as other men dyde & aske helpe and grace with good perseueraunce / yf it please god to performe thy wyll & brynge the to thy purpose.  But for as moche as there be many that haue not a sadde grounde ne but lytell felynge how they sholde loue and drede god / whiche is spedefull & nedefull for all men to knowe: Therfore to suche as be not knowynge I wyll shewe fyrste in what maner they sholde loue & drede god / that they may be \u00fee more stable in the loue of god.  After that I shall shewe by the grace of god foure degrees of loue / whiche euery crysten man relygyous & seculer sholde holde and kepe, & may performe for the more partye yf his wyll be feruently set to the loue of god.  \u00b6 Now than as I sayd I shall in the begynnynge with the helpe of god wryte & shewe somwhat of the drede of god / that shal be to his worshyp, & proufyte to the reder. C \u00b6 What is drede / and how a man sholde drede god. I Rede that \u00fee drede of god is begynnynge of wysedom.  \u00b6 Drede, as clerkes haue wryten before this tyme, is in many maners.  But I suppose thre kyndes of drede ben moost nedefull for to knowe.  The fyrst is drede of man or drede of the worlde.  The seconde is called drede of seruage.  The thyrde is called a chaste drede or a frendely drede.     .I.  \u00b6 The fyrst whiche is drede of man or of the worlde is / whan a man or woman dredeth more the punysshynge of the worlde, as betynge the body or prysonynge, than the punysshynge of the soule; Also whan a man dredeth more to lese his temporall goodes in this passynge worlde than to lese the blysse without ende.  / this drede is counted for nought / for god almyghty forbad this drede whan he sayd thus: Dredeth hym not that may slee \u00fee body / but rather drede hym that may sende the body & soule in to euerlastynge fyre.     .II.  \u00b6 And the seconde drede whiche is the drede of seruage / is whan a man withdraweth hym or absteyneth hym fro synne / more for drede of the payne of helle than for loue that he sholde haue to god. Euery suche man what goodnes he doth it is not for drede to lese euerlastynge blysse whiche he desyred not / but for drede onely of suffrynge of grete paynes whiche he dreded sore.  this drede suffyseth not as thou shalt see afterwarde / but yet it may be good & proufytable.     .III.  \u00b6 The thyrde drede whiche is called a chaste or a frendely drede is / whan a man dredeth the longe abydynge here for grete desyre that he hath to be with god; Also whan he dredeth that god wyll go fro hym / as peraduenture he withdraweth his grace fro hym; Also whan he dredeth to dysplease god for the grete loue & desyre \u00feat he hath for to please god.  / suche drede cometh of loue & that pleaseth moche god.  Take\n\n\n \n\nthan hede how here be reherced thre maner degrees of drede: / fle the fyrst for it is not proufytable.  The seconde may be proufytable / for some men there be whiche drede god by cause they sholde not be sente into hell to brenne there with the deuyls in euerlastynge fyre.  This drede may be good, for by this waye they may come in to the loue of our lorde god, as by this waye that I shall shewe.  All be it that thou drede our lorde god onely for payne, yet louest thou not god whome \u00feou dredest / thou desyrest not yet goodnes of vertues / but thou withstandest \u00fee wyckednes of vyces / whan thou withstandest the wyckednes thou begynnest to desyre goodnes.  Whan thou desyrest goodenes & vertues / than cometh in to the the thyrde maner of drede / whiche is called as I sayd a chast or a frendely drede.  For than thou dredest to lese the goodnes & grace that god hath put in \u00fee / thou dredest than also to lese the blysse that is ordeyned for the / & so by this thou shalt drede god that he forsake not the / whan thou dredest god in this maner thenne hast thou hym sykerly with the / & so for his loue thou shalt desyre to be with hym.  Thus mayst thou well knowe how drede of god may brynge the in to the loue of god / yf thou loue god than thou hast wysedom / so thus the drede of god is the begynnynge of wysedom. Take hede than and drede god in the maner as I haue reherced / for yf thou drede wel god thou shalt not be slowe in his seruyce.  He that dredeth well god leueth no goodnes vndo whiche he may do to the pleasure of god.  Yf thou drede god thou wilt kepe his commaundementes / and the drede that thou hast to god shall brynge the in to euerlastynge sykernes where \u00feou shalt neuer drede. Of the drede of god wexeth a grete deuocyon and a maner sorowe with full contrycion for [thy] synnes / thrugh that deuocion and contrycion thou forsakest thy synnes / and perauenture somwhat of thy worldely goodes.  By that forsakynge thou lowest the to thy god & comest in to mekenes / thorugh mekenes thy flesshely lustes ben destroyed / by \u00feat destruccion all vyces be put out & vanysshed awaye /by puttynge out of vyces than vertues begyn to wexe and sprynge.  Of the shynynge of vertues the clennes of the herte is purchased.  By clennesse of thy herte thou shalte come to full possessyon of the holy loue of Cryst.  By these wordes thou mayst knowe howe \u00feou shalte drede for loue / & how thou mayst come to loue thrugh drede of god.  But the more [\u00feat] loue encreaceth in the / the more drede gooth from the / so that yf thou haue grace to come to a feruent loue thou shalt but lytell thynke on drede for the swetnesse that thou shalt haue in the loue of god.  but yet be thou neuer so parfyte it is nedefull that thou drede discretely as longe as thou art in this worlde.  [And] for as moche as I sayd thou mayst come to loue yf thou drede god / see now furthermore what is charyte & loue to god, How & in what maner thou shalt loue hym / why thou shalt loue hym, How \u00feou shalt knowe whan god of his mercy graunteth the that grace to conne loue hym. D \u00b6 What is charyte and how & why thou shalt loue thy god. \u00b6 Of foure degrees of loue / & in the fyrst ben fyue poyntes. \u00b6 Ordeyned loue. CHaryte as I rede is a loue that we sholde haue to god / for as moche as he is almyghty god; also charyte is a loue wherby we sholde loue our neygh-\n\n\n \n\nbour as our-selfe for god.  And these be two pryncypall commaundementes of god.  The fyrst longeth to \u00fee loue of god / whiche is \u00fee gretest commaundement of \u00fee lawe of god; The seconde longeth to \u00fee loue of thy neyghbour and this is lyke to the fyrst; / & thus thou hast what is charyte and loue.  \u00b6 See now how thou shalt loue god. / thou shalt loue god with all thy herte / all thy soule / & with all vertue, as thus.  Whan \u00feou puttest away from the or withstandest with all thy power all thynge that is pleasynge or lykynge to thy flesshe for the loue of \u00fee blessyd flesshe of cryste / than thou louest hym with al thy herte & al thy soule.  Of this mater thou shalt her more afterwarde; / but se now ferthermore [why] thou shalt loue hym.  \u00b6 The causes why thou shalt loue god ben without nombre hauynge rewarde to his benefaytes / but two causes we haue pryncypally aboue other.  One is for he loue[d] vs fyrst with all his herte and al his soule swetely & strongely.  Swetely whan he toke flesshe & blood & became man for oure loue.  Strongly whan he suffred deth for loue of man.  The seconde cause is / for ther is no thynge that may be loued more ryghtfully ne more proufytable.  More ryghtfull is there none than the loue of hym that made man and deyed for man.  More proufytable thynge is there none that may be loued than almyghty god / for yf we loue hym as we be bounde / he wyll gyue vs Ioye and blysse without ende / where no thynge lacketh but all thynge is plenteuous and euerlastynge.  \u00b6 Se now how thou shalt knowe whan god putteth grace in the for to knowe loue.  Whan the trauayle whiche thou hast for the loue of god is lyght & lykynge to the / than thou begynnest to haue sauour in the loue of god.  For ther is no maner trauayle greuous ne trauaylous to hym \u00feat loueth god feruently & trauayleth wylfully for the loue of god.  \u00b6 Also stedfast loue feleth no bytternesse / but all swetenesse / for ryght as bytternesse is syster to the vyce of hatred / right so swetnesse is syster to \u00fee vertue of loue, so that in loue is all swetnesse.  \u00b6 Also the trauayle of louers may be in no maner trauaylous ne greuous.  For ryght as hawkers & hunters what euer trauayle they haue it greueth them not for the loue & lykynge that they haue in theyr game / ryghth so what thynge it be that a man loueth & taketh vpon hym a trauayle for that thynge that he loueth, [either] it is no trauayle [to hym] / [or elles] yf it be trauaylous it lyketh hym to haue trauayle for \u00feat thynge whiche he loueth.  Take than good hede of these wordes / for yf thou loue god thou wylt gladly trauayle & suffre for \u00fee loue of god; yf thy trauayle semeth than lyght to the / or ellys yf thou louest or desyrest gladly to haue trauayle for the loue of god thou mayst wel knowe that god of his grace hath put in the a begynnynge to come to loue.  Whan thou hast suche a gracyous begynnynge withdrawe not \u00feat loue from hym for no maner dysease that may fall to the.  For many men & women there be that whyle they be in prosperyte / that is to say / whyle they be in welth & in rest, gladly they wyll shewe loue to god suche as they can:  But yf god sendeth hym ony dysease or ony maner of chastysynge, anone her loue swageth; & that is no sadde loue.  For who so loueth trustyngly & sadly he loueth as well in his aduersyte as in prosperyte / for what god sendeth to vs it is for our proufyte / therfore be it helth be it wo \u00feat he sendeth we sholde hertely thanke hym &\n\n\n \n\nnot withdrawe our loue from hym; for no nede that he hath to our loue / but for grete profyte that we sholde haue to loue hym / & for his grete goodnes that he wyll chastyse vs here all for our better. Thus than haue I shewed in fewe wordes what is charyte & loue to thy god / howe thou shalt loue hym / why thou shalt loue hym / and how thou shalt knowe whan thou hast grace to conne loue hym.  Lerne than thus to loue; & se now ferther-more what proufyte and grace cometh of loue.  \u00b6 In the loue of god ben fyue gracyous thynges: Fyre / lyght / hony / wyne / & sonne. .I.  \u00b6 The fyrst is fyre, clensynge the soule of all maner vyces thrugh holy medytacyons.     .II.  \u00b6 The seconde is lyght, shynynge in the soule with clerenes of vertues thorugh holy prayers.     .III.  \u00b6 The thyrde is hony, makynge swete the soule whan he hath in mynde the benefaytes & \u00fee grete gyftes of god almyghty / & yeldynge to hym thankynges.     .IIII.  \u00b6 The fourth is wyne, fulfyllynge \u00fee soule with a grete gladnes thorough a swete contemplacyon. .v.  \u00b6 The fyfth is a sonne, makynge the soule clere with a shynynge lyght in myrthe withouten ende, & gladynge the soule with an easy hete in Ioye & blysse euermore lastynge.  Thus thou mayst see what proufyte he shall haue that can well loue.  God than of his grete grace graunte vs hym so to loue as it is moost to hym pleasynge.  Amen. \u00b6 Now ferthermore I wyll shewe to the as I sayd before / foure degrees of loue, whiche thou mayst kepe & easely come to one after an other yf thou haue good wyll. FOure degrees of loue there be / the fyrst is called an ordeyned loue or els ordynat loue / that is to saye a loue ordeyned to be knowen and kept of all maner men & women of euery degree in the worlde.  To this degree of loue longen .v. poyntes to be kepte.  The fyrst is thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned.  The .II. is that thou loue the worlde to no superfluyte. The .III. is that thou loue thy neyghbour for god.  The .IIII. is that thou loue thy frende for his good lyuynge.  The .v. is to loue thyn enemye for the more mede of god. E  \u00b6 The fyrst is that thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned. THe fyrste poynte is as I sayd: thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned, as thus.  Thou shalt take mete & drynke, clothynge and al other thynge that is nedefull to thy body / in resonable maner, to kepe thy body in his estate, in comforte of thy soule, to trauayle & contynue in the seruyce of god / & not for to nourysshe thy flesshe in lust & lykynge with dyuerse [&] delycate metes & drynkes / for ther-of cometh foule stynkynge synne & many bodyly sykenes / namely whan ther is to moche excesse.  This wytnesseth an holy clerke & sayth / they that delyted them in lustes of the flesshe they haue ful often many dyseases in theyr flesshe.  \u00b6 Also as I rede a soule that is wonte to delytes of the flesshe gadreth togyder many fylthes and wyckednes.  Thou mayst also do no exces / for yf thou vse the to excesse / thou fallest in to the vyce of glotonye / whiche [as] thou knowest well is dedely synne.  Of \u00feat synne I rede thus: / where \u00fee vyce\n\n\n \n\nof glotony reygneth in ony man he leseth \u00fee ghoostly strength yf he had ony before; And but yf the wombe of glotonye be swaged all his vertues ben cast downe.  / therfore loue thy flesshe to [his] sustentacyon & not to delytes & to excesse / for here thou mayst well knowe & se that it is good & nedefull to flee delycacyes. But thou shalt vnderstande here \u00feat I counseylle the not to forbere ony mete or drynke in specyall / for the vyce of delycacye is not in the mete / but in \u00fee lust that thou hast in mete; / therfore sayth an holy clerke: Often we take deynte metes without blame / & somtyme other metes and comyn to euery man not without gylte of conscyence.  So thus it semeth wel whan we take ony mete for delyte more than for sustenaunce we offende god / therfore flee delytes & lustes of mete & drynke and loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned / & than thou hast the fyrst poynte of this degree of loue. F  \u00b6 The seconde is thou shalt loue the worlde to no superfluyte. THe seconde poynte is thou shalt loue the worlde to no superfluyte.  As thus: Yf thou loue god thou shalt not desyre ne loue vanytees of the worlde / ne worldely goodes more than \u00fee nedeth.  Yf god hath ordeyned the to an hyghe degree in the worlde / as for to be a lorde or a lady / or for to haue ony soueraynte ghoostly or worldely / by reason reuerence must be done to the more than to an other man or woman.  For after that the fyrst man Adam was inobedyent to goddes commaundement it was ordeyned by almyghty god that man sholde be subgect to man; Also for as moche as \u00fee people must [nedes] haue gouernaunce / therfore it is reason to do reuerence to them that haue power & gouernaunce aboue other.  But all be it \u00feat \u00feou be grete & worldely worshyp must be do to the / loue it not ne desyre it not but mekely yelde all \u00feat worshyp to god whiche myght haue made the a subget there he hath ordeyned the a lorde or a souerayne / & thrugh that lownes thou shalt haue some grace to withstande \u00fee desyre of worldely vanytees.  I say[d]e ferthermore / yf thou loue the world to none superfluyte / \u00feou shalt not desyre ne loue worldely good more than the nedeth.  As thus: thou knowest well ynough in thy begynnynge whether thou art lord or subgect / poore or ryche / holde the apayde with thy degree so that thou haue thy sustenaunce / & desyre to be no greter / but onely as goddes wyll is & as he wyll dyspose for the.  Yf thou holde the not payde with that that god hath sente to the and to thyn a resonable lyuelode / but euer desyrest for to be greter and greter in the worlde, than thou louest the worlde to superfluyte for thou desyrest more than thou nedest, & soo by that foule desyre thou fallest in to the vyce of couetyse whiche is repreued by [al] goddes lawe as a foule dedely synne.  This synne is full peryllous / for I rede where that the synne of couetyse is in a man, \u00feat man is made subgect to all other vyces.  I fynde also that couetyse and pryde be as it were one vyce or one wyckednes / in so moche that yet where pryde reygneth there is couetyse / & where couetyse reygneth there is pryde.  / this vyce is so wycked & so greuous [\u00feat] as longe as it reygneth in ony man he shal haue no grace for to drawe to god-warde.  This wytnesseth well a full holy clerke saynt Gregorye & sayth thus in an Omelye: That in none other wyse we may ne can neuer come ne drawe to \u00fee begynner & maker of\n\n\n \n\nall goodnes / but that we caste awaye frome vs the synne of couetyse whiche is rote of all euylles.  Than it semeth well, yf thou wylt come to the loue of god thou must flee the synne of couetyse.  \u00b6 Thre thynges there be in the worlde as I rede whiche men desyre aboue all other worldely thynges.  The fyrst is rychesse.  The seconde is lustes.  And \u00fee thyrde is worshyp.  Of rychesse cometh wycked dedes.  Of lustes cometh foule dedes.  And of worshyp cometh vanytees. Ryches engendreth couetyse; lustes noryssheth glotonye & lecherye / & worshyp noryssheth boost & pryde.  Thus thou mayst knowe what peryll it is to loue the worlde.  [Therfor yf thou wylt stande sikerly, loue not the worlde] more than nede is / & than thou shalt kepe the seconde poynte of this degree [of loue] G \u00b6 The thyrde is thou shalt loue thy neyghboure for god. THe thyrde poynte is howe thou shalt loue thy neyghboure for god / to this thou arte bounde by the commaundement of god where he commaundeth & sayth / thou shalt loue thy neyghboure as thy-selfe; / yf thou shalt loue hym as thy-selfe nedes thou must loue hym.  / thou shalt loue hym also for god.  Of this loue speketh saynt Austyn & sayth / thou shalt loue god for hym-selfe with all thy herte / & thy neyghboure for god as thy-selfe / that is to saye / loke where-to and for what thou louest thy-selfe so thou shalt loue thy neyghboure.  Thou shalt loue thy-selfe in all goodnesse & for god / ryght so thou sha[l]t loue thy neyghboure for god & in all goodnes, but in none euyll.  / therfore sayth the same clerke: He that loueth men \u00feat is to saye his neyghbours, he loueth or sholde loue them for they ben good & ryghtfull or els that they may be good & ryghtfull / & that is to saye thou shalt loue them in god or els for god / & in this maner euery man sholde loue hymselfe.  Also of the loue of thy neyghbour I rede, whan thou forsakest a synguler prouffyte for \u00fee loue of thy neyghbour than \u00feou louest thy neyghbour.  Also thou louest thy neyghbour as thy-selfe whan thou doost hym no harme but desyrest the same goodnes & prouffyte ghoostly & bodely to hym that \u00feou desyrest to thy-selfe.  Loue thus thy neyghbour or els \u00feou louest not god.  To this accordeth an holy clerke & sayth: By the loue of god the loue of thy neyghbour is purchased / & by \u00fee loue of thy neyghbour the loue of god is nourysshed / for he \u00feat taketh no hede to loue his neyghbour he can not loue his god.  But whan thou hast fyrste sauour in [\u00fee] loue of thy neyghbour / than thou begynnest to entre in to \u00fee loue of god.  Loue thus thy neyghbour for god & than thou kepest the thyrde poynte of this degree of loue. H  \u00b6 The fourth is thou shalt loue thy frende for his good lyuynge. THe fourth poynte is / thou shalt loue thy frende for his good lyuynge.  Yf thou haue a frende that is of good lyuynge / thou shalt loue hym in double maner / for he is thy frende, and for the goodnes that is in hym; yf he be not good of lyfe but vycyous thou mayst loue hym but not his vyces.  For as I rede parfyte frendshyp is whan thou louest not in thy frende \u00feat sholde not be loued / and whan thou louest in hym or desyrest to hym goodnes whiche is to be loued.\n\n \n\nAs thus: though it be so \u00feat thy frende lyueth folysshly thou shalt not loue hym [for his] foly lyuynge but that he may by goddes grace amende hym and be parfyte in lyuynge.  For what man it be \u00feat loueth hymselfe in folye he shal not prouffyte in wysedom.  Also the same clerke sayth in an other place: Loueth not the vyces of your frendes yf ye loue your frendes.  Loue than thy frende for his good lyuynge / & than thou shalt kepe the fourth poynte of this degree of loue. I \u00b6 The fyfthe is thou shalt loue thyn ennemye for the more mede. \u00b6 In the seconde degree of loue ben thre poyntes. \u00b6 Clene loue. THe fyfth poynte is thou shalt loue thyn ennemye for the more mede.  A grete dede of charyte it is & medeful to forgyue them \u00feat haue trespaced ayenst vs, with all our herte.  \u00b6 It is but lytell goodnes & full lesse mede to be wel wyllynge to hym that doth the no harme / but it is a grete goodnes & a greter mede that thou be well louynge to thyn ennemye, And \u00feat thou do good & wyll good with all thy power to hym that doth euyll or is in wyll to do euyll to the with all his power.  Of this mater speketh an holy clerke and sayth: It is holden a grete vertue amonge worldely men to suffre pacyently theyr ennemyes / but it is a greter vertue a man to loue his enemye / for that vertue is presented as for sacrefyce before the syght of almyghty god.  Also to this purpose accorden the wordes of cryst where he sayd to his dyscyples: Loue your ennemyes / do good to theym that hate you / & praye for them \u00feat pursyewe you to dysease / & for them \u00feat despyse you, that [&yogh;]e may be the chyldren of the fader in heuen. Loue than thyn enemye for \u00fee more mede yf \u00feou wylt kepe \u00fee fyfth poynt of this fyrst degree of loue.  \u2014 \u00b6 Shortly thus ben declared to the the fyue poyntes of \u00fee fyrst degree of loue.  In the fyrste, yf thou take good hede, thou art warned and counseyled for the loue of god / and as thou art bounde by all crysten lawes / to withstande the synne of glotonye & al other flesshely lustes.  In the seconde poynte to withstande \u00fee foule vyce of couetyse, pryde & all other vanytees of the worlde.  In the thre last poyntes to loue thy neyghbour, thy frende & all other men for the loue of god and for the more mede.  Loue than god in this fyrst maner of loue / and thou shalt thrugh his grete grace yf thou wylt come to the seconde degree of loue. THe seconde degree of loue is called a clene loue.  Yf thou wylt come to this seconde degre of loue thou must kepe thre poyntes.  The fyrste is / \u00feat thou loue no vyce with vertue.  The seconde is \u00feat thou despyse all euyll custome. The thyrde is that thou sette not lytell by synne whether it be lytell or grete. K \u00b6 The fyrste poynte is thou shalt loue no vyce with vertue. THe fyrst poynte is / thou shalt loue no vyce with vertue.  As thus: what euer thou be in mannes syght / be ware that thou be not vycyous Inwarde in thy soule vnder colour of vertues whiche \u00feou shewest openly.  Our ghoostly ennemye \u00fee fende hath many subtyltees to dysceyue mankynde, But amonge all this is a grete dysceyte / whan that he maketh a vyce lyke to vertue, & vertue\n\n\n \n\nlyke to vyce.  This thou mayst see by ensample.  For all be it that mercy is a grete vertue where \u00feat it is kepte in \u00fee worshyp & in \u00fee name of god, yet it is vycyous where it is do in worshyp of man & not of god.  Also [the] vertue of ryghtwysnes is tourned in to vyce / whan it is do for worldely couetyse or els for anger or inpacyence.  The vyce also of pryde is hyd somtyme vnder mekenesse, As whan a man loweth & meketh hymself in speche and in berynge to be holde meke & lowely.  Pacyence also semeth in many a man whan there is none: As whan a man wolde take vengeaunce yf he myght for the wronge that is do to hym / but for he may not / or els he hath no tyme to wreke hym on his enemye / for that cause he suffreth, & not for the loue of god.  By these ensamples & many other thou mayst well knowe that vyces somtyme be lyke to vertues.  To this accordeth saynt Iherom & sayth thus: A grete & an hyghe connynge it is to knowe vyces & vertues, for all be it that vyces & vertues be contraryous / yet they be so lyke that vnnethe the vertue may be knowe from the vyce / ne \u00fee vyce fro the vertue.  Be ware therfore & loue so sadly vertues without ony faynynge that \u00feou hate all maner vyces / and so \u00feou mayst kepe the fyrst poynte of this degree of loue. L \u00b6 The seconde is \u00feou shalt hate all euyll customes. THe seconde poynt is thou shalt despyse all euyl customes.  A grete peryll it is to haue an euyll dede in custome.  For as I rede / synnes be they neuer so grete ne so horryble / whan they be drawe in to custome they seme but lytell to theym that vse suche synne in custome / in so moche that it is to them a grete lykynge to tell and shewe theyr wyckednes to al other men without ony shame.  Of this & suche vsage speketh an other holy clerke & sayth: Whan synne cometh so in vse that the herte hath a lust & a lykynge ther-in / that synne shall ful fayntly be withstande.  For whan a synne is brought in to custome it byndeth sore the herte & maketh the soule bowe to hym, that it may not ryse agayne & come in to the ryght waye of clene lyfe; For whan he is in wyll to ryse / anone he slydeth & falleth agayne.  For this sayth the same clerke in an other place: Many there be \u00feat desyren to come out of synne / but for as moche as they ben closed in the pryson of euyll custome they may not come out from theyr wycked lyuynge.  \u00b6 Also to this purpose I rede that he \u00feat vseth hym not to vertue[s] in his yonge age he shal not conne withstande vyces in his olde age.  Thus \u00feou mayst well se \u00feat yf thou be vsed in ony synne it wyll be full harde to withstande it.  And but thou leue all maner synne to thy power \u00feou hast none clene loue to thy god / therfore withstande all maner synne & take none in custome / than \u00feou shalt kepe the seconde poynt of this degree of loue. M \u00b6 The thyrde is thou shalt not sette lyght by synne be it neuer so lytell. \u00b6 In the thyrde degree of loue be fyue poyntes. \u00b6 Stedfast loue. THe thyrde poynte is / thou shalt not sette lyght by synne / as thus.  What euer synne it be lytel or grete / drede it ryght dyscretly in thy conscyence and\n\n\n \n\nset not lytell there-by.  For as I rede what man \u00feat passeth mesure in takynge of his lyuelode as often more than hym nedeth that man offendeth god / this semeth to many men full lytell trespas:  But this holy man saynt Austyn sayth: It is no lytell synne for as moche as we trespas euery daye there-in for the more partye; In as moche as we synne therin euery day we synne therin often / & by that we multeplye our synnes & that is full peryllous / therfore it is full nedeful to drede al suche venyall synnes & sette not lytell by theym.  Also venyall synnes be they neuer so lytell / they be moche to be dradde.  As the same clerke sheweth by ensample of lytell bestes where they be many to-gyder / be they neuer so lytell yet they slee & do moche harme; Also \u00fee granes of sande be full lytell / but yet where a shyp is ouer-charged with sande it must nedes synke or drenche.  Ryght so it fareth by the synnes; be they neuer so lytell they be full peryllous.  For but yf a man be [\u00fee] rather ware & put theym awaye they shall make hym forto synne deedly.  Therfore yf thou wylt haue a clene loue to god / charge in thy conscyence euery synne lytell & grete & withstand in the begynnynge & put it out as soone as god wyll gyue to the grace, with contrycyon, confessyon & som almesdedes.  And than thou shalt kepe the thyrde poynte of this degree of loue.  \u2014 Here is reherced the mater of these poyntes.  \u00b6 Thus ben declared the thre poyntes of the seconde degre of loue.  In the fyrste thou art counseyled to loue all vertues and hate all vyces.  In the seconde poynte, that thou haue no synne in vsage but that thou voyde it soone & that thou hate all other euyll custome.  In \u00fee thyrde poynt that thou [be] not to lyght of conscyence / but that thou be ware & drede euery synne lytell & grete by counseyl of thy confessour. Yf thou kepe thus these poyntes for the loue of god than thou louest god in the seconde degree of loue / that is to saye in a clene loue.  Loue than saddely in this degree / & by goddes grace thou shalt the soner come to the thyrde degree of loue. THe thyrde degree of loue is called a stedfast loue.  Yf thou wylt come to this degre of loue \u00feou must kepe fyue poyntes.  The fyrste is thou shalt loue god with all thy desyre.  The seconde is: what euer thou do thynke vpon the worshyp & drede of god.  The thyrde is thou shalt do no synne vpon trust of other good dedes.  The fourth is thou shalt rule the so dyscretly \u00feat thou fayle not for [to] feruent wyll.  The fyfth is that thou fall not from thy good lyuynge for feynte herte or by temptacyon. N \u00b6 The fyrste is thou shalt loue god with all thy desyre. THe fyrste poynt is thou shalt loue god with all thy desyre / thou mayst not loue stedfastly but thou loue with all thy desyre.  An holy desyre it is to desyre the presence of almyghty god for the grete loue that thou haste to god.  Suche an holy desyre is soo acceptable to god as I rede / that what man hathe a grete desyre, all be it he speke not with the tonge / he cryeth full loude with the tonge of his herte; And [he] that not desyreth, how euer he loueth to our syght outwarde / or speketh to our herynge, he loueth not in his hert & as a dombe man he is to-fore god whiche may not be herde.  Of suche holy desyre I rede also,\n\n\n \n\nthe lenger that loue lacketh whiche is so sore desyred \u00fee more feruent is his desyre whiche abydeth, & that desyre begynneth to brenne thorugh strength of \u00feat desyrynge loue / in so moche that though the body or the flesshe fayle \u00feat desyre is nourysshed & encreaced.  To this accordeth saynt Gregorye & sayth / holy desyres wexen & encreasen in taryenge & abydynge / for where desyres fayle in abydynge there is no sad desyre.  Thus than loue god stedfastly with all thy desyre / & so thou shalt kepe the fyrste poynte of this degree of loue. O  \u00b6 The seconde is thou shalt in the begynnynge of thy werkes thynke on the worshyp & drede of god. THe seconde poynte is: what euer thou do thynke vpon the worshyp & drede of god.  If thou kepe this thou shalt the more sykerly lyue to goddes pleasure. For what dede thou art in wyll to perfourme in worshyp of god, thou mayst be syker of grete mede.  Also yf thou drede god, thou art aferde for to do ony thynge that sholde be dyspleasynge to hym / & for as moche as \u00feou dredest thou doost it not; Soo by that drede thou leuest that thynge vndo whiche shold tourne the in to grete peryll of thy soule yf it had ben perfourmed in dede.  By this thou mayst wel knowe that it is full spedfull to thynke in \u00fee begynnynge of all thy werkes vpon the worshyp & drede of god.  To this accordeth the techynge of saynt Paule where he sayth thus:  What euer ye do in worde or in dede / do it in the name of our lorde Ihesu cryst.  For he that begynneth all thynge in \u00fee name of almyghty god he begynneth in the worshyp of god.  Loue than so stedfastly almyghty god / that what euer thou shalt do thynke fyrst in \u00fee worshyp & drede of god / & thus thou shalt kepe the seconde poynte of this degree of loue. P  \u00b6 The thyrde is thou shalt do no synne vpon trust of other good dedes. THe thyrde poynt is thou shalt do no synne vpon trust of other good dedes. What man that synneth wylfully he neyther loueth ne dredeth god.  Yf thou synne vpon trust of ony goodnes wylfully thou synnest, so in \u00feat \u00feou louest not stedfastly.  \u00b6 To this purpose I rede also that he is full vnkynde that is full of vertues & dredeth not god.  Also a grete folye & a grete pryde it is for to synne vpon trust of ony good dedes.  For be thou neuer so full of vertues or goodnes / vnkyndnes to thy god may destroye all tho vertues.  More vnkyndenes mayst thou not shewe than dysplease god wylfully / whiche is begynner and gyuer of all goodnes; be ware therfore & flee suche vnkyndnes / & do no synne vpon trust of other good dedes.  Of suche vnkyndenesse also it is nedefull for to be ware for the more acceptable [that] thou art to god thorugh thy good lyuynge / \u00fee more culpable shalt thou be yf that thou fall agayne in to synne and in to euyll lyuynge. \u00b6 And of this thou hast ensample of Adam.  For as moche as he was fulfylled fyrst with goodnes / therfore his trespas was moche the more whan that he fell in to synne.  \u00b6 Also I rede \u00feat it is but a sclyder hope where a man synneth vpon trust for to be saued / for he that so doth he neyther loueth ne dredeth god, And but yf that we loue and drede god to our connynge or knowynge we\n\n\n \n\nmay not be saued / therfore it is more spedefull for to drede well than to trust amys.  Also it is more prouffytable a man to holde hymselfe lowe & feble than to desyre to be holden stronge / and for feblenes to fal and be lost.  Take hede than what goodnes that god putteth in the and thanke hym mekely & praye hym of contynuaunce / & doo no synne vp trust of other good dedes.  And thus thou shalt kepe the thyrde poynte of this degree of loue. Q  \u00b6 The fourth is thou shalt rule the dyscretly that thou fayle not for [to] feruent wyll. THe fourth poynt is thou shalt rule the so dyscretly that thou fayle not [for] to feruent wyll.  To kepe this it is nedefull to the to haue the vertue of discrecyon; as thus:  Yf thou take for \u00fee loue of god so moche abstynence, wakynge or other bodely penaunce \u00feat thou mayst not for feblenes contynue to trauayle in \u00fee seruyce of god / than is thy wyll to feruent:  For be thy loue neuer so grete god is not pleased whan \u00feou rulest \u00fee in suche maner that thou mayst not abyde in his seruyce thrugh thy mysrule.  Therfore be ware and rule the vp reason / take nomore vpon the than thou mayst bere / besy not the to folow other stronge men or women of olde tyme in doynge of penaunce other wyse than thy strength wyl aske; And gouerne thy lyuynge by good counseyll that thou fayle not thrugh thyn owne folye.  For almyghty god of his endeles mercy hath ordeyned heuens blysse to the synfull men thrugh dedes of charyte & of mekenes where they be done in mesure and with dyscrecyon, The deuyll is so enuyous to mankynde that somtyme he styreth an vnparfyte man or woman to fast more than he may, [to] begynne thynges of hyghe parfeccyons hauynge no rewarde to his feblenesse / in soo moche that whan his bodely strength begynneth to fayle, eyther he must contynue that he hath begonne so folysly for shame of men / or ellys vtterly leue all for feblenesse.  To this accordeth saynt Austyn and sayth: Our wycked ennemye the deuyll hath not a more spedefull engyn to drawe the loue of god from mannes herte / than to [m]ake vs by his fals suggestyon to l[y]ue vnwysely & without reason / that is to saye as I sayd before:  To styre vs for to take fastynges, wakynges and other bodely penaunces ouer our myght.  Take therfore to the dyscrecyon & rule the so dyscretly that thou fayle not for to feruent wyll / and than thou mayst kepe the fourth poynte of this degre of loue. R  \u00b6 The fyfthe is thou shalt not leue thy good lyuynge for feynte [herte] ne for temptacyon. THe fyfthe poynte is / thou shalt not fall fro thy good lyuynge for feynte herte ne for temptacyon.  To kepe well this poynt it is nedefull to haue a perseueraunt wyll & a stable hert ayenst all temptacyons.  Some men there be whan ony heuynesse bodely or ghoostly or whan that ony grutchynge of the flessh cometh to theym / anone they ben so heuy & so full of vnlust that they leue theyr ghoostly trauayle & fal fro theyr good lyuy[n]ge / suche men haue no stable ne stedfast herte.  Therfore yf thou wylt loue god stedfastly suffre no heuynes ne dysease chaunge thy trauayle ne thy herte fro th[e] seruyce and loue of god / but take hede of the wordes of almyghty god where he sayth:  He is blessyd that is perseueraunt vnto\n\n\n \n\nhis lyues ende.  Here-of thou hast ensamples of holy martyrs & confessours whiche neuer wolde be departed fro the loue of god for all the persecucyon that myght be do to them.  Also to suche men of feble herte & vnlust speketh saynt Bernarde and sayth thus:  Whan thou art vnlusty or dyseased with heuynesse / haue none vntrust therfore ne leue not thy trauayle / but suffre mekely & aske conforte of hym that is begynner & ender of all goodnes.  And all be it that thou haue not suche deuocyon than as in other tymes / thynke well how he that gafe \u00fee suche deuocyon hath withdrawen it for thy defautes as for a tyme / & happely to th[i] more mede / therfore withstande all suche heuynes and stande strongely / suffre lowely / & take gladly the chastysynge of god / & euermore aske helpe & grace.  \u00b6 Ferthermore some for defaute of knowynge & for vnstablenes haue fall thorough trauayle of temptacyons / therfore whan thou art soo trauayled with ony temptacyons that shold be lettynge / or els is dredefull to the / chaunge not therfore thy wyll / but stande stedfastly & shewe thy dysease to thy ghoostly fader, askynge of hym to gyue the suche counseyll that may be moost helpynge to thy soule.  Yf thou do thus mekely with a ful good wyll to please thy god & to withstande the temptacyons of thyn enemye, the grace of the holy ghoost wyll fully fulfyll bothe hym & the / hym for to teche / the for to lerne / & take of hym suche counseyll that shall be moost strength & conforte to the & confusyon to the deuyl.  And so by the helpe of god thou shalt be conforted in suche maner that \u00feou shalt not fall thorough trauayle of temptacyons / but euer the lenger the more stable and the more stronge [be] in the loue of god to thy lyues ende.  Thus than take hede that thou fall not from thy good lyuynge for feynte herte ne by temptacyons / and than thou mayst kepe the fyfth poynte of this degree of loue.\u2014  \u00b6 Here is shortly declared the mater of these fyue poyntes. \u00b6 Thus be declared the fyue poyntes of the thyrde degree of loue.  In the fyrste thou art taught to loue god with full desyre.  In the seconde for to do all thynge in \u00fee worshyp of almyghty god / and euer for to drede god in the begynnynge of all thy werkes.  In the thyrde fully to withstande all maner synne / and no synne for to do vpon trust of other good dedes.  In the fourth that thou fall not for defaute of dyscrecyon.  In the fyfth thou art taught & counseylled for to haue a stable herte and for to withstande all temptacyons that thou fall not from thy good lyuynge.  Yf \u00feou kepe thus these fyue poyntes than thou hast the thyrde degree of loue / whiche is called a stedfast loue to god.  And yf thou loue god stedfastly thou mayst soone come to perfeccyon / and so by the grace of god thorugh encreace of vertues thou shalt lyghtly come to the fourth degree of loue. \u00b6 In the fourth degree of loue ben .VIII. poyntes. \u00b6 Parfyte loue. S \u00b6 How by encreace of vertues thou mayste come to parfeccyon. THe fourth degree of loue is called a parfyte loue.  An other loue there is all be it I make noo mencyon but of foure / whiche is called moost parfyte loue. Of that loue speketh saynt Austyn & sayth:  Charyte is parfyte in some men & inparfyte in some men, But \u00feat charyte that is moost parfyte may not be had\n\n\n \n\nhere whyle we lyue in this worlde.  Of the same moost parfyte loue speketh the same clerke thus:  In the fulfyllynge of the countre of charyte / that is to saye / in fulfyllynge of heuen where that all is loue and charyte, This commaundement of god shall be fulfylled where he sayth / \u00deou shalt loue thy lorde god with al thy herte / with all thy mynde / and with all thy soule; For whyle ony flesshely desyre is in man god may not be loued with all the herte and full mynde. And by this thou mayst knowe that there is a passynge loue whiche may not be fulfylled in this worlde / and that may well be called moost parfyte loue.  But here perauenture some man wyll aske / why it is commaunde[d] / but it myght be performed in this worlde?  To that the same clerke answereth and sayth / that it is skylfull that suche a perfeccyon sholde be commaunded / and this he sheweth by ensample in this wyse.  Ryght as no man may renne euen and sykerly but he knowe whether he shall renne, In the same maner noo man sholde knowe [t]his moost parfyte loue / but it hadde be shewed in the commaundementes of god; Yf noo man hadde knowen it no man wolde haue laboured hym to come therto.  \u00b6 Now sythen it is so we knowe [well that we so must loue, it is nedeful we] sette vs in a redy waye, whyle we be here, that wyll brynge vs euen to that moost parfyte loue.  A more syker waye is there none in this worlde than the waye of parfyte loue.  Wherfore I counsell the to haue this fourth degree of loue whiche is called a parfyte loue, that [thou] may come the more sykerly to [\u00fee most] parfyte loue.     \u00b6 Of parfyte loue speketh Saynt Austyn and sayth:  He that is redy to deye gladly for his brother, in hym is parfyte loue.  To this acordeth the wordes of Cryste where he sayth:  No man hath more charyte in this worlde than he that putteth his soule for his frendes / that is to saye than he that gyueth gladly his lyfe for the loue of god to wynne his frendes soule.  This loue is the gretest loue in this worlde / & many there be, I trowe, thrugh the gyfte of god that haue this parfyte loue; but yf it thynke the harde to come to suche an hyghe loue / be therfore not agast.  For other parfyte loue there is wherin thou mayst loue parfytly thy god / as I fynde by the techynge of an holy clerke where he counseylleth in this wyse:  \u00b6 Yelde we vs to god of whome we be made / and suffre we not theym to haue the maystrye ouer vs whiche ben not of so grete value as we be / but rather haue we \u00fee maystrye ouer theym; As thus / lete reason haue the maystrye ouer vyces / lete the body be subgect to the soule and lete the soule be subgect to god / & than is all \u00fee parfeccyon of man fulfylled.  Thus we sholde lyue by reason as \u00fee same clerke sheweth by ensample. / For as we put lyuely thynges before them \u00feat be not lyuely, Also as we put wytty thynges before them that haue no wytte ne reason, Also ryght as we putte tho that ben not dedely before theym that ben deedly / ryght so yf we wyl lyue parfytly we must putte proufytable thynges before theym that ben lusty and lykynge, Also put them that ben honest before theym that ben proufytable, Also putte theym that ben holy before them that ben honest, And put all thynges that ben parfyte before them that ben holy.  Take hede than of this / for yf thou wylt lyue after this techynge than thou mayst lyue parfytely / yf thou lyue parfytely \u00feou sha[l]t loue parfytely; lyue than thus & thou\n\n\n \n\nshalt come to parfyte loue.     But for as moche as it is full harde to come sodaynly to suche a parfyte loue / therfore take hede to tho thre degrees of loue whiche ben reherced before / & begynne to lyue sadly in the fyrste / & than from \u00fee fyrst clymbe vp to the seconde / & fro the seconde to the thyrde / & yf thou be sadly stabled vpon the thyrde thou shalt lyghtely come to \u00fee fourth where is all perfeccyon / yf thou haue perfeccyon thou shalt l[o]ue perfytely.  Begyn than at the fyrst degree of loue / & so encreace in loue & vertues yf thou wylt come to this degree of parfyte loue.  \u00b6 I rede that some men begynne to be vertuous / som encreace in vertues / and some be parfyte in vertues.  Ryght so it fareth by the loue of god; as soone as thou art in wyll & begynnest to loue god / that loue is not yet parfyte but thou must stande fast & nourysshe \u00feat wyll / & yf it be well nourysshed it wyll wexe stronge / & yf it hath full strength than it is parfyte.  \u00b6 To this purpose I rede also that no man may be sodaynly in so hyghe a degree / but euery man that lyueth in good conuersacion / whiche may not be without loue / they must begynne at the lowest degree yf they wyll come to an hyghe parfeccyon.  Thus than, good brother or syster whether thou be, withstande all vyces / and gadre to the vertues for the loue of god, and encreace in them tyll they ben parfytely stabled in the.  And amonge all vertues loke that thou haue a feruent wyll / be besye [in] deuout prayers / stande strongely ayenst temptacyons / be pacyent in trybulacyons / & stable in perseueraunce, that thou lyue parfytely & so come to parfyte loue.  Take none hede of them that set lytell by parfeccyon / as of them that saye \u00feat they kepe not to be parfyte / it suffyseth to them to be lest in heuen / or come within the yates of heuen; these be many mennes wordes & they be peryllous wordes.  For I warne \u00fee forsothe what man hath not parfyte loue here he shall be purged with paynes of purgatorye / or ellys with dedes of mercy performed for hym in this worlde / and so be made parfyte / or he come to heuen blysse / for thyder may noman come but he be perfyte.  Beware therfore of suche lyght & foly wordes, & trust more to thyn owne good dedes whyle \u00feou art in this worlde than to thy frendes whan thou art deed. / Thynke also this lyfe is but short, \u00fee payne[s] of purgatory passe all the paynes of the world, the paynes of hell is euerlastynge / & the Ioye & blysse of sayntes is euermore durynge.  Thynke also ryght as god is full of mercy & pyte, ryght so he is ryghtfull in his domes.  Yf thou wylt thynke on these wordes ofte, I trust to the mercy of god thou shalt waxe [so] stronge in vertues & withstande so vyces \u00feat within a short tyme thou shalt come to a parfyte loue.  Whan god hath so vysyted the that thou can loue hym parfytely than shal all thy wyll & all thy desyre be for to come to \u00feat loue whiche is moost parfyte / that is to saye euermore to se almyghty god in his gloryous godhede, euermore with hym to dwelle.  But for as moche as we may not come to our desyre / but we begynne somwhat to loue hym here in this lyfe:  Therfore almyghty god mercyfull thorugh the besechynge of his blessyd moder Marye graunte vs grace so to loue hym here / \u00feat we may come to the Ioyfull & euerlastynge lyfe / where is moost parfyte loue, & blysse without ende.  Amen. \u00b6 Here is reherced shortly how by encreace of vertues thou mayst come to parfeccyon & what vertues thou shalt loue. IN this fourth degree of loue / whiche is called a parfyte loue / thou art taught and counseylled to begynne at a lowe degree yf \u00feou desyre to haue an hygh degree, as thus:  Yf thou wylt haue this fourth degree of loue thou must begynne at the fyrst, & so encreace in vertues tyll thou come to parfeccyon.  But amonge all vertues & al other poyntes whiche ben reherced before / fyue poyntes there be as me thynketh spedefull & nedefull euery man to haue & kepe \u00feat ony good dede shall begynne & brynge to good ende.  The fyrste is \u00feat thou haue a feruent wyll.  The seconde is that thou be besy in deuoute prayers.  The thyrde is \u00feat thou fyght strongely ayenst all temptacyons.  The fourth is that thou be pacyent in trybulacyons.  The fyfth is that thou be perseueraunt in good dedes.  Of these poyntes I spake before in the fourth degree of loue / but for as moche as they be not there fully declared / my wyll is by \u00fee helpe of god to wryte more openly of eche of them one after an other / & fyrst to wryte of good wyll, for \u00feat must be begynnynge & endynge of all good dedes. T \u00b6 How good wyll is and may be in dyuerse maners. WYll may be [& is] in dyuerse maners / good and euyll / besy & feruent / grete & stronge / but for as moche as reason whiche god hath gyue onely to mankynde techeth & sheweth in euery mannes conscyence full knowynge of euyll wyll / & by cause \u00feat good wyll may be in dyuerse kyndes / therfore I leue at this tyme to speke of euyl wyl / & purpose me fully thrugh \u00fee techynge of almyghty god to declare somwhat openly \u00fee vertue of good wyll.  I trow wel \u00feat euery man wold be good or wolde do some good dede be he neuer so synful & perauenture not chargeth gretly to be good ne besyeth hym to do good dede. But for as moche as he wolde good I may not saye but [\u00feat] he hath a good wyll. So [\u00feat] euery man that wyll well be it strongly or feyntly / lytell or grete / in as moche as he wolde good he hath a good wyll.  Neuertheles though this be a good wyll it is worthy lytell or no mede / for it is no feruent ne besy wyll, for he desyreth to be good without ony trauayle / & so he suffreth that good wyl passe & chargeth not gretly to be good ne to do good dede.  But what tyme he besyeth hym to performe that good wyll in dede / in that he desyreth to be good & besyeth hym to do good though he haue not fully his purpose ne may not performe his wyll in dede / yet there is a feruent wyll & a besy wyll & [as] I hope a medeful wyll.  So that what man desyreth to be good & to do good dede, & therto besyeth hym to performe that wyll in dede, of hym it may wel be sayd that he hath a feruent wyll.  Yet is \u00feat wyll but lytell acounted & feble hauynge rewarde to a grete & stronge wyll.  But what tyme thou hast performed in dede that thou hast so feruently wylle[d], than thou hast a grete & a stronge wyll / so that of euery man that is in wyll to be good or to do good dedes, whan he performeth that wyll in dede it may be sayd sothly of hym \u00feat he is a man of a grete and a stronge wyl.  To this acordeth saynt Austyn & sayth thus:  He that wyl do the commaundementes of god & sayth he may not he hath a good wyll / [but] that wyll is but lytell & feble / for he may do & kepe the commaundementes whan he hath a grete & a stronge wyll.  As who sayth what man hath a grete & a stronge wyll may kepe the commaundementes of god / and but\n\n\n \n\nhe kepe them he hath no grete ne stronge wyll.  Yf thou wylt thou mayst kepe the commaundementes of god / yf thou kepe them thou shalt be good & do good / so yf thou wylt \u00feou mayst do good & be good.  But yet somtyme & ofte it falleth that by the grace of the holy ghoost we wyl do somwhat with al our herte to the worshyp of god that is not in our myght ne power to performe in dede; whan our wyll is sette in this maner the goodnes of god is so moche that he receyueth that wyll as for dede.  Of this saynt Austyn bereth wytnes & sayth:  What thou wylt & mayst not do god acounteth for dede.  Thus mayst thou knowe with-in thy-selfe whan thou hast a lytell or a feble wyl / a grete or a stronge wyll / & how acceptable a good wyll is to almyghty god where thou doost thy besynes to performe it in dede.  But se now more openly & in specyal poyntes how thou shalt knowe whan thou hast a good wyl.  Saynt Gregory sayth: We haue a good wyl whan we drede the harme of our neyghboure as our owne dysease / & whan we be Ioyfull of the prosperyte of our neyghboure as of our owne proufyte.  Also whan we trowe other mennes harmes [our harmes] as by waye of compassyon / & whan we acounten other mennes wynnynges our wynnynges as by waye of charyte.  Also whan we loue our frende not for the worlde but for god / & whan we loue & suffre our enemye for the loue of god.  Also whan we do to no man that we wolde that no man dyde to vs.  Also whan we helpe our neyghboure to our power and in wyll somwhat ouer our power.  These poyntes stande moche by the wyll withoute dede / but who so wylleth these fully in his herte to be do hath a good wyll, And as I sayd before his good wyll shall be acounted before god as for dede.  Thus than haue I shewed whiche is good & feruent wyll though it be not performed in dede / whiche is a grete and a stronge wyll / and how good wyll in some poyntes is acounted for dede before god all be it that it be not performed / so that the wyller do his besynes to his power. \u00b6 Take hede now ferthermore and be ware for though thou haue all these maners of good wyll to thy felynge / it may be so that yet thy wyll is not rygtfull / se how.  Be thou neuer so full of wertues: but thou conforme thy wyll to goddes wyll in all maner thynges bodely and ghoostly thy wyll is not ryghtfull.  To this purpose saynt Austyn sayth thus:  The ryghtwysnes of god is that thou be somtyme hole of body & somtyme syke / and perauenture whan thou art hole and in prosperyte / than the wyll of god pleaseth the moche and thou sayst that he is a good god and a curteys; yf thou say so or thynke so onely for thou hast helth or welth of body / thou hast no ryghtful wyl for as moche as thou conformest not thy wyll to goddes wyll / but onely in helth and welth.  For yf he sente the sykenesse or other dysease / perauenture thou woldest be sory and grutch ayenst the wyll and the sendynge of god / & soo in thy wyll thou woldest make the wyll of god / the whiche may not be but euermore ryght and euen, bowe downe to thy wyll / whiche boweth and is full crocked / and in this thou hast ne[i\u00fe]er ryghtfull herte ne ryghtfull wyll.  But what tyme thou dressest thy wyll that is so croked and makest it stande ryght with \u00fee wyll of god whiche may not be croked but euer standeth euen / that is to saye noo thynge wylle[st] helth ne sykenesse / welth ne wo / but euer holdest the pleased with the wyl\n\n\n \n\nof god, than thou hast a ryghtfull wyll.  \u00b6 Also it is nedefull to a good wyll that [shall] encreace in vertues and come to the loue of god, that it be stable and resonable.  What tyme thou art trauayled sore with temptacions and grutchest not ayenst goddes wyl but with a glad herte thou thankest god & suffrest hym lowely & thynkest well it is chastysynge to the for thy synnes, than is thy wyll stable. And whan thou desyrest not hygh rewarde in blysse for thy good lyuynge or ghoostly trauayle whiche thou hast here in erthe but onely at goddes wyll what he wyll dyspose for the & no thynge at thy wyll, than thou hast a resonable wyll. Thus I haue shewed the dyuerse kyndes of good wyl whiche be full spedefull & nedefull the for to knowe yf thou be in good wyll to [conne] loue god / & yf thou haue a stable & a resonable wyll \u00feou shalt soone come to parfyte loue.  \u00b6 Now perauenture thou \u00feat trauaylest in ghoostly werkes wylt thynke or say thus / somtyme it happe[th] that thou woldest do some ghoostly trauayle & thou may not performe it in dede / & all be it so thou do it in dede it is full oft with so grete heuynesse \u00feat thou grutche somwhat for defaute of ghoostly comfort.  To this I may answere as I sayd before: yf \u00feou grutche \u00feou hast no stable wyll, & yf thy wyll be stable \u00feou shalt not drede in this case / & se why.  Thou shalt vnderstande \u00feat the flesshe is euer contraryous to \u00fee spyryte & \u00fee spyryte contrarye to \u00fee flesshe: herof \u00feou hast ensample where saynt Poule sayd of hymself in this wyse:  \u00deat goodnes whiche I wolde do I do not / as yf he had sayd thus:  Some good dedes I wyll & desyre in my soule / but I may not fulfyl them for feblenes of my flesshe / & all be it somtyme I performe them in dede it is without ony gladnes.  but what, for this trowest \u00feou \u00feat thapostle sholde therfore lese his mede / for he wolde & myght not or els [for] he dyde good somtyme without gladnes? Nay, but moche the more his mede was encreaced, for two causes.  Fyrst for the trauaylous werkynge of his body that he suffred whan the flesshe stryued soo sore ayenst the goodnes of the spyryte.  The seconde cause is for the heuynes & trauayle whiche \u00fee spyryte suffred whan he had no ghoostly comforte.  In the same maner what euer grutchynge thou hast of thy flesshe ayenst good dedes or what heuynesse thou suffrest for defaute of ghoostly conforte / be not therfore abasshed so thy wyll be stable, but suffre & abyde lowely the grace of god for thy more mede.  Be than stable in wyll & the deuyll ne thy flesshe shall neuer haue maystrye of the / for all the deuyls in hell may not make the to synne but \u00feou put therto thy wyll.  Ne all the aungels of heuen may not make the to do good dedes but \u00feou put-to thy wyll.  \u00b6 Take hede than that thy wyll be well dysposed to god & that it be set stably & resonably / & than thou hast a spedefull begynnynge to come to the loue of god.  but for as moche as mannes wyll is ordeyned fyrst & dysposed with the grace of god that he shall wyll good: to haue that grace in wyll & in all other dede / Prayer me thynketh is nedefull & therfore somwhat I wyl wryte of prayer as god wyll gyue me grace. U  \u00b6 What profyte is in prayer and in what maner thou shalt praye. PRayer [&] ensample of good lyuynge [be] moost spedefull to gete grace & to drawe men to loue god.  A deuoute prayer & often vsed purchaseth grace of almyghty god & putteth awaye the fals suggestyons of the fende & stablysshe[th]\n\n\n \n\na man in all goodnesse.  Therfore god sayth to his dyscyples thus:  Waketh & prayeth that ye fall not in [to] temptacyons.  Ryght as it is nedefull for a knyght that shall go in to batayll haue with hym armoure & wepen / ryght so it is nedeful & spedefull to euery crysten man to haue with hym contynuell prayer / for what of our owne freelte / what by [the] malyce & enuye that the fende hath to vs / we be euer in this worlde in ghoostly batayll more or lesse by the suffraunce of our lorde god.  Therfore sayth saynt Gregory:  The more we be trauayled with thoughtes or flesshely desyres / the more nede we haue to stande besely in prayers.  So thus \u00feou mayst se that prayer is spedefull & nedefull.  \u00b6 Also prayer as I rede is a souerayne helpe to thy soule / confort & solace to thy good aungell / torment & payne to \u00fee deuyl / acceptable seruyce to god / parfyte Ioye / sad hope / & ghoostly helthe without corrupcyon.  \u00b6 Prayer is also a nedefull messager from euery mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen / & namely from that mannes soule whiche is moche troubled & hath no reste.  Some conscyences there be whiche be good / that is to saye be well ruled & be in reste / to suche prayer is also a nedefull messager to holde \u00fee soule in ghoostly confort & to encreace it & stable it in goodnes.  But there be many other men & wymen of dyuerse conscyence.  Some there be that haue a bad conscyence whiche be in rest & not troubled / & that ben they that ben sette fully to euyll & not to good.  Some haue a bad conscyence & somwhat be troubled in theyr conscyence / & tho be suche \u00feat be somwhat euyll or begynne to be euyll.  Some haue good conscyence & also ben greued in theyr conscyence / & [tho] be suche as lyue euyll & begynne to be good.  Whyle the conscyence is thus troubled the soule hath no reste / therfore to pursyewe for helpe & grace / prayer that nedefull messager must do well his offyce / that is to saye besely without ony taryenge / & strongely without ony feynynge; & rather [to] come to the presence of almyghty god hym nedeth to haue two specyall frendes / \u00feat is to say stedfast fayth and trusty hope: with these two frendes prayer taketh his waye & renneth fast to \u00fee yates of heuen / & entreth without ony lettynge / for he goth to the presence of \u00feat good lorde truly to do his message with full fayth & sad hope / full pyteously he sheweth his nedes & the perylles of [the] soule.  Than anone the good lorde so ful of pyte & mercy sendeth his blessyd loue in to \u00fee soule thorugh the pursute of that good prayer.  Whan this loue entreth in to that soule anone he maketh all glad \u00feat was full elenge & sory / he maketh in peas & reste that was sore troubled.  Hope cometh agayn that was out / and ghoostly strength \u00feat was awaye is fully restored.  Whan the enemyes of the soule / that is to saye the fendes se this helpe & confort to the soule / with sorowfull chere they torne awaye & thus they begynne to crye:  Alas alas, sorowe & wo is come to vs / fle we fast awaye for god fyghteth for this soule.     Thus mannes soule is delyuered fro the fende by prayer / & so it may sothly be sayd that prayer is a spedefull & a nedefull messager fro mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen.  \u00b6 Thus \u00feou hast herde what is prayer / se now ferthermore how \u00feou shalt praye. \u00b6 As often as thou prayest / or what euer thou prayest, put all thy wyll in [to] goddes wyll / in the ende of thy prayer / desyrynge euermore in euery askynge his wyll to be fulfylled and no thynge thy wyll.  For thou mayst praye & aske\n\n\n \n\nsome thynge that he wyl not here ne graunte / as yf \u00feou praye for soules that be dampned thy prayer is not accepted.  Also it may so be that thou desyrest not that is moost helpynge to thy soule ne to other perauenture for whom \u00feou prayest.  Also many men praye somtyme for no good entent / and for that they be not herde.  Therfore to be alwaye syker, whan euer thou prayest put thy desyre and thy entent in askynge in goddes wyl, for he knoweth all thynges, and what euer thou prayest he wyll not graunte the but that is moost proufytable for the.  To this accordeth an holy clerke and sayth:  Oftentyme god graunteth not many men at theyr wyll / for he wyll graunte them other grace than they aske, to more helth of theyr soules.  So that it is nedeful that we put all our askynge in to his ordynaunce.  To this acordeth [also] saynt Bernarde and sayth: No man sholde set lyght by his prayer / for he to whom we praye aftertyme the prayer is passed from our mouth or from our herte / he wryteth it in his booke / and trustyngly we may hope that he wyll graunte that we aske or ellys that is more proufytable to vs.  Thus than what euer thou prayest put all thy wyll in to goddes wyll.  \u00b6 Also whan that thou prayest thou shalt praye generally / that is to saye / as thou prayest for thy selfe so thou shalt praye for other.  Thus thou must do for thre causes:  Fyrst for loue and charyte wyll that thou do so. And therfore sayth the apostle:  Prayeth eche of you for other that ye may be saued.  The seconde cause is / for the lawe of god wyll that euery man helpe other in nede.  This thou hast by the techynge of saynt Poule where as he sayth thus:  Eche of you bere others burthen / that is for to say / eche of you praye for other or helpe other in nede & so ye shall fulfyll the lawe of cryste. The thyrde cause is / for who so prayeth for al other as for hymselfe / \u00fee goodnes of god wyll that he shall be partyner of all other mennes prayers. To this acordeth saynt Ambrose & sayth thus:  Yf thou pray onely for thy self and for none other than shall none other pray for the but thy selfe / & yf thou praye for all other than all other shall praye for the.  Thus than whan \u00feou prayest praye for all other.  \u00b6 Also whan thou shalt praye thou must praye with full herte & put away fro the all vanytees of the worlde, all ymagynacyons & all ydel thoughtes.  To this acordeth an holy clerke & sayth:  Whan we stande to praye we must with all our herte gyue our entent to that we praye / that is to say we must voyde all flesshely & all worldely thoughtes & suffre not our herte otherwyse to be occupyed than about our prayer.  But to this perauenture thou sayst that though \u00feou be neuer in so good wyll to praye / thyn herte is awaye from thy prayer & encombred with dyuerse thoughtes that thou mayst haue no whyle thyn herte sadly vpon thy prayer.  To this I graunte \u00feat what [thrugh] the fende whiche euer is besy to lette all goodnes & what thrugh the vnstablynes of man thyn herte shall not be stable vpon thy prayer I trowe scarsely the tyme of a Pater noster.  But whan thou go to thy prayer / take good hede what nede thou hast to praye / what thou wylt praye / & how grete, how myghty & how ryghtfull & mercyfull he is to whom \u00feou wylt praye.  Yf thou set thyn herte thus in the begynnynge of thy prayer / thou shalt not I trow gretly be\n\n\n \n\nletted / & though it be so that somtyme thou be letted with other thoughtes / fyght ayenst them with all thy besynes / & anone tourne to thy prayer.  Yf thou wylt fyght wylfully in this maner god of his grete grace & endeles pyte wyll alowe thy good wyll / & moche the rather for thy trauayle graunte that \u00feou askest.  Thus than whan thou wylt praye \u00feou must praye with full herte.  \u00b6 Also an other maner prayer there is / that who soo hath grace to come therto his prayer shal soone be herde yf he praye resonably.  This maner of prayer is whan thou art vysyted by the grace of god with grete conpunccyon of herte and swetnes of deuocyon.  Conpunccyon is a grete lou[nes] of thy soule spryngynge out of thy herte with teeres of thyn eyen, whan \u00feou bethynkest the vpon thy synnes & vpon the dredefull dome of god.  Whan \u00feou hast this conpunccyon & these teeres than \u00feou hast full deuocyon / with suche deuocyon besely praye for all tho that haue nede / for what thynge \u00feou prayest in \u00feat tyme so it be worshyp to god \u00feou art anone herde without ony taryenge.  For as I rede prayer peaseth almyghty god & maketh hym torne to mercy; but whan deuoute teeres come with prayer than of his grete pyte he may no lenger suffre / but anone as he were constrayned he graunteth what we aske.  Ferthermore yf \u00feou be vsed to suche deuocion \u00feou shalt feruently desyre to conne loue god / & so by goddes grace \u00feou shalt soone come to loue / thus than loue prayer yf thou wylt come to \u00fee loue of god.  And for as moche as many men & women be moche trauayled by dyuerse temptacyons or they come to loue / therfore [to] be ware of theym & sooner to withstande them / somwhat I wyl shewe of temptacyons as me thynketh is nedefull. X  \u00b6 How \u00feou mayst be ware & knowe of temptacyons wakynge or slepynge / & how \u00feou shalt withstande them. BY the ordynaunce of almyghty god there be ordeyned good aungels to defende vs fro euyll & to styre vs to vertues and to kepe vs in goodnes. \u00b6 Also other badde aungels & euyl spyrytes there be whiche trouble mankynde with dyuerse temptacions to preue mannes stablenes, & that to grete mede to mannes soule.  The power of this wycked spyryte / that is to saye the fende is so grete \u00feat the more a man besyeth hym to please god \u00fee rather he is about to greue hym.  For as I rede oftymes it happeth \u00feat many men whan th[e]y gyue them hole to contemplacyon or to other deuocyons than they be trauayled with stronge temptacyons by \u00fe[e] suffraunce of god, that they may knowe theyr owne feblenes & to kepe theym meke & lowe, for they sholde not lese \u00fee grete mede of god for ony maner spyce of pryde / whiche mede is ordeyned for theyr ghoostly trauayle.  Also in whateuer maner of lower degree [a] man or woman be that wyll withstande synne to his power & lyue after the techynge of goddes lawe / to al suche the wycked spyryte hath enuye / & euermore gyueth theym some maner of batayll grete or lytell, slepynge or wakynge.     \u00b6 Other men & women there be that he suffreth to be in reste & peas / & tho ben suche as drede not god but nyght & daye gyue them to all maner lustes & lykynges of theyr flesshe / for they ben so redy to synne & to do his wyll that hym nedeth not to styre them to euyll / & therfore he suffreth them in peas & without ony trauayle of temptacyons.  Of suche men speketh saynt Austyn & sayth thus:\n\n\n \n\nSome men & women profer themyselfe to synne wylfully & abyde not the temptacyons of the fende / but they go before the temptacyons & be redyer to synne than the fende is to tempte them.  \u00b6 And sythen it is so that euery man whiche is besy to please god shal be trauayled and pr[e]ued with dyuerse temptacyons, I wyl shewe the to my felynge, and as I rede of other auctours, \u00fee maner of begynnynge of euery temptacyon, that thou mayst be ware of them & rather withstande the begynnynge, & so ouercome the hole temptacyon.  \u00b6 I rede that our enemye the fende whan he wyll make vs to folowe his wyll or ellys for enuye wyll trauayle and greue vs, he begynneth with fals suggestyons / that is to saye he putteth in our myndes diuerse ymagynacyons / as worldely & flesshely thoughtes, and somtyme other thoughtes whiche be full greuous & peryllous / eyther to make vs haue a grete lust & lykynge in them that be worldely or flesshely / or ellys to brynge vs in grete heuynes or drede thrugh tho thoughtes whiche be greuous & peryllous.  \u00b6 As to the worldely or flesshely thoughtes, yf we suffre theym to abyde in oure herte so longe wylfully tyll we haue lykynge in them / than hath the deuyll wonne a grete stronge warde of vs & pursyeweth ferthermore with all his besynes to make vs assente to hym as in wyll to performe it in dede.  By that dede thou mayst vnderstande euery dedely synne after \u00fee suggestyon is in \u00fee begynnynge.  To some he begynneth with a fals suggestyon of pryde / or ellys of couetyse / to some with a suggestyon of glotonye or lecherye / and so of all other synnes wherin he supposeth soonest to haue maystrye ouer man / for euery man is enclyned more to one maner synne than to an other.  And where he hath maystrye / that is to say where that synne is performed in dede / he besyeth hym sore to brynge it in to custome / & so thorugh the custome to haue vs hole vnder his power.  Go fle & withstande all these perylles, the prophete Dauyd sayth in the sawter: Go awaywarde or bowe awaye from euyll & do good / that is to saye after the exposycyon of doctours: Go from the euyll of suggestyon / from the suggestyon of entysynge / from \u00fee euyl of delytynge / from the euyll of assentynge / from the euyl of dede / & from the euyll of custome.  Withstande than all suche worldely or flesshely thoughtes as moche as god wyll gyue the grace, \u00feat thou fal in none of these euylles whiche as I haue sayd be full peryllous.  \u00b6 Ferthermore as to \u00fee greuous thoughtes & peryllous, perauenture \u00feou wylt aske whiche be tho thoughtes \u00feat be so greuous & peryllous. All tho thoughtes that thou hast ayenst thy wyl whiche make the heuy or sory, be greuous.  And for to shewe the more openly: what man that ymagy[n]eth vpon hyghe maters \u00feat be ghoostly whiche passe all erthely mennes wytte, As vpon \u00fee fayth of holy chyrche or suche other that neden not to be specyf[y]ed at this tyme, that man hath greuous thoughtes & peryllous.  Yf we suffre suche ymagynacyons abyde & take none hede in the Legynnynge to the fals suggestyon of \u00fee fende, within [a] short tyme or euer we be ware eyther he wyll make vs lese our kyndely wytte & reason / or ellys he wyl brynge vs [in] to vnreasonable drede. Of suche temptacyons it is nedefull to be ware & put theym awaye yf \u00feou may with deuoute prayers & other occupacyons / & yf thou may not voyde them suffre them than esely.  For \u00feou shalt vnderstande \u00feat they be ryght nedeful & medefull for thy soule / for but it were so \u00feat suche thoughtes come somtyme in to\n\n\n \n\nthy mynde \u00feou sholdest seme in thyselfe that \u00feou were an aungell & no man / therfore it is nedefull that thou be tempted otherwyle with euyll thoughtes that thou mayst se & knowe thyn owne feblenes & vnstablenes whiche cometh of thyselfe / and that \u00feou mayst fele the strength whiche \u00feou hast onely of god. Also thou shalt suffre suche thoughtes esely / but thou mayst voyde them / for all suche thoughtes so \u00feat thou delyte the not in them they ben a grete purgynge for thy soule / & a grete strength to kepe within the vertues / & all be it \u00feat they be sharpe & bytter for the tyme thynke well \u00feat they shal make thy soule clene that was ryght foule / & make it hole that was ryght syke / and brynge it in to euerlastynge lyfe & helth without ende to the whiche lyfe & helth may no man come withoute grete sharpenes & bytternes.  Also whan \u00feou art trauayled with thoughtes whiche \u00feou mayst not put away, thynke wel that it is a grete ryghtwysnes of god that thou haue suche thoughtes: For ryght as \u00feou hast had full often thy wyl & lykynge in worldely and flesshely thoughtes ayenst the wyll of god / ryght so it is \u00fee wyl of god that thou haue other thoughtes ayenst thy wyl.  \u00b6 But yet it is good that thou be ware of them & that \u00feou drede them dyscretly and truste stedfastly in god.  For whan the soule hath no delyte in suche thoughtes but hateth & lotheth them / than they be a clensynge & a grete mede to \u00fee soule; but yf it so be that there come somtyme ony lykynge of synne or of ony vanyte thorugh suche thoughtes / than withstande & thynke that it is a fals suggestyon of the deuyll / & therwith be dredful and sory that \u00feou hast offended god in lykynge of suche fals ymagynacyons.  I rede that for suche thoughtes onely \u00feou shalt not be dampned though they be come in to thy mynde / for it is not in thy power to let them to come: But yf it be so that \u00feou assente or delyte in them than be ware, for there thou dyspleasest god.  Also it is good that \u00feou drede though \u00feou assente not to euyll thoughtes, that \u00feou fall not for pryde.  For eche man that standeth in vertues standeth onely by \u00fee vertue & grace of almyghty god.  Thus than be ware of thoughtes, for here \u00feou mayst se that all temptacyons begynne with fals suggestyons of the wycked spyryte. And yf \u00feou haue grace to withstande suche thoughtes \u00feou shalt ouercome all temptacions.  And for moost souerayn remedy ayenst all maner temptacions it is good that \u00feou shewe thy disease to thy ghoostly fader as oft as it nedeth [or] els to some other good man of ghoostly lyuynge, as I sayd before in the fyfth poynt of \u00fee thyrde degree of loue.     \u00b6 Ferthermore to speke of temptacyons, I rede that whan the wycked fende may not ouercome a man wakynge / than is his besynes to trauayle & to tary hym slepynge.  And that is to dysceyue hym yf he may in thre maners.  One is to begyle hym thrugh glad & confortable dremes.  The seconde is to greue & to lette hym thrugh sorowfull & dredefull dremes.  And the thyrde is to make hym the rather assente to synne wakynge thrugh foule syghtes or other dyuerse vanytees whiche he suffreth slepynge. therfore it is good to be ware of dremes / for in some thou mayst wel byleue & some it is good to sette at nought.  for somtyme god sheweth comfort to wycked men slepynge \u00feat they sholde the rather leue theyr synne, & somtyme he comforte[th] good men slepynge to make them more feruent in his loue; but for as moche as \u00feou myghtest lyghtly be disceyued thrugh suche illusyons, I counseyll\n\n\n \n\nthe to put them all out from thy herte or els to shewe them to thy ghostly frendes.  For oftymes he \u00feat hath moche lykynge in dremes is moost taryed and out of reste.  Also \u00feou shalt not drede suche dremes what-soeuer they be: For as I rede yf thou be stable in the fayth of holy chyrche / yf \u00feou loue god with all thy herte / yf \u00feou be obedyent to god & to thy souerayns what euer \u00feou be as well in aduersyte as in prosperyte, and yf \u00feou put all thy wyll at goddes dysposycyon, than shalt \u00feou drede no maner of dremes; for though they be dredefull & sorowfull to thy syght be therfor not agast ne heuy / but trustyngly put al togyder in to goddes honde he to ordeyne for the as he wyll.  Also though they be to thy syght glad & confortable, desyre them not ne byleue not in them but yf it [so] be that they torne to the worshyp of god.  Yf \u00feou do thus by the grace of god \u00feou shalt ouercome all temptacions slepynge.  Thus than, slepynge & wakynge, yf thou withstande in the begynnynge \u00fee fals suggestyons of that wycked aungell, \u00feat is to saye wycked thoughtes & peryllous ymagynacyons as I sayd before / than \u00feou shalt ouercome all temptacions.  To this acordeth saynt Austyn & sayth: Yf we withstande the lust & lykynge of vnclene thoughtes there sholde no synne reygne in our dedely bodyes.  Withstande than thoughtes & be stronge ayenst temptacions / & so thrugh that ghoostly strength \u00feou shalt lyghtly come to the loue of god.  And for as moche as suche temptacyons & other worldely trybulacyons fall oftentymes to goddes seruauntes in to grete mede of theyr soules so that they can suffre them mekely & thanke god therfore, I wyll shewe a fewe confortable wordes of \u00fee vertue of pacyence by the whiche \u00feou mayst be styred for to suffre bodely and ghoostly dyseases gladly for the loue of god. Y  \u00b6 How thou shalt be pacyent & what tyme pacyence is moost nedefull. CHaryte whiche is moder & keper of vertues is lost full often by Inpacyence. To this acordeth saynt Gregorye & sayth thus: Men that be Inpacyent whan they wyll not suffre gladly trybulacyons / destroye the good dedes whiche they dyde whyle \u00fee soule was in peas & reste / & sodaynly they destroye [w]hat ghoostly werke that they haue begonne by good auysement & grete trauayle.  By these wordes it semeth \u00feat it is nedefull to kepe with vs the vertue of pacyence yf we sholde come to the loue of god / for without encreace of vertues we may not come to \u00feat loue.  \u00b6 To speke than of pacyence:  I rede \u00feat in prosperyte it is no vertue to be pacyent / but what man is troubled with many aduersytees & standeth stably hopynge in the mercy of god / he hath the vertue of pacyence. \u00b6 In thre maner of wayes goddes seruauntes haue nede to be pacyent in trybulacions.  The fyrst is whan god chastyseth them with his rodde / as with losse of worldely godes or ellys with bodely sykenes.  The seconde is whan our enemye the fende trauayleth vs with dyuerse temptacyons by the suffraunce of god.  The thyrde is whan our neyghbours do to vs wronge or despytes.  In eche of these thre our enemye besyeth hym to brynge vs oute of pacyence / & in eche of these we sholde ouercome hym yf we be pacyent.  As thus: yf we suffre easely & gladly the chastysynge of god without ony grutchynge; Also yf we delyte vs not in the fals suggestyons of the fende & assente in no maner to his wycked temptacyons;\n\n\n \n\nAlso yf we kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre ony wronges or despytes of ony of our neyghbours / thus we sholde ouercome that wycked fende with the vertue of pacyence.  \u00b6 I sayd as for the fyrst we shold ouercome the fende yf we suffre easely & gladly the chastysynge of god without ony grutchynge / this is good \u00feat we suffre for it is for grete loue whiche he hath to vs & [for] grete mede that he wyll ordeyne for vs.  To this purpose saynt Austyn speketh & sayth thus to eche mannes soule callynge the soule doughter, and sayth thus: Doughter yf thou wepe vnder thy fader wepe not with Indygnacion ne for pryde / for that thou suffrest is for medycyne to the & for no payne / it is a chastysynge & no dampnacyon; yf thou wylt not lese thyn herytage, put not from the that rodde / take no hede to the sharpenes of that rodde / but take good hede how well thou shalt be rewarded in thy faders testament. These wordes may be remeued to euery crysten man & woman, as thus: Yf our fader in heuen sholde chastyse vs with losse of goodes or with sykenes of body we sholde not grutche / but we sholde be sory \u00feat we trespaced ayenste our fader / & take mekely his chastysynge & euer aske mercy.  His chastysynge is hel[\u00fe]e to our soules & reles of grete[r] penaunce / his chastysynge is but a warnynge for loue & not dur[esse] for wrath.  [If] we sholde not be put out frome the herytage of heuen it is nedefull we be boxum to our fader in heuen & suffre lowely & gladly his ryghtfull chastysynge for our greuous trespasynge, that thrugh the vertue of pacyence we may come to that grete herytage / that is to saye to the blysse of heuen to \u00fee whiche he ordeyned vs in his last testament, that was whan he gafe for vs his herte blood vpon \u00fee crosse.  Thus we must suffre gladly the chastysynge of god without grutchynge.  This chastysynge as I sayd is somtyme in sykenes of body / & somtyme in losse of worldely goodes.  Yf thou be chastysed with sykenesse of body / haue in thy mynde the wordes of the apostle whan he sayd thus: All be it that our body outwarde be corrupted with sykenes our soule within is made newe & more clene frome daye to daye.  Also yf [thou] be chastysed with losse of goodes / take hede to \u00fee pouerte of Iob where \u00feou may haue a grete example of pacyence, for with grete thankynges to god he toke full mekely & gladly grete pouerte, sykenes & many dyseases & sayd:  Our lord gafe / our lorde hath take awaye / as it pleaseth hym so it is do / blessyd be the name of \u00feat lorde Iesu.  Thus \u00feou hast example to suffre gladly the chastysynge of god.  \u00b6 I sayd also as for the seconde we sholde ouercome \u00fee fende yf we delyte vs not in his fals suggestyons & yf we assente in no maner to his wycked temptacyons.  In the last chapytre before thou hast how thou shalt be stronge & stable ayenst all temptacyons: Se now more openly why thou shalt gladly suffre temptacyons without ony grutchynge.  One skylle is for yf thou suffre them not gladly but grutchest ayenst them than \u00feou lettest them that sholde helpe the / the whiche be good angels & other sayntes / & helpest thyn enemyes whiche be wycked fendes / for a greter confort is none to theym but whan they fynde a man heuy and grutchynge; therfore suffre them gladly and aske helpe & mercy of hym in whom all grace is and confort.  Also yf thou suffre suche temptacions gladly and assentest not to them in lykynge ne in wyll / than thou stoppest the\n\n\n \n\nfende that he dar not assayle the with other temptacions, for he dredth to be put out from the & be ouercome whan he feleth the so stable & so pacyent; that is a grete drede to hym.  For whan he trauayleth a man with temptacyons and he be withstande / than be his paynes moche the more encreased in hell.  Withstande than his temptacyons with the vertue of pacyence & so thou shalt ouercome hym.  \u00b6 As for the thyrde way of pacyence I sayd \u00feat we sholde kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre wronges or despytes of [our] neyghbours / suche wronges it is [m]edefull to suffre for the loue of god:  For as saynt Austyn sayth / he that is so pacyent that gladly wyll suffre wronges shall be ordeyned grete and myghty in heuen.  If than thy goodes be taken from the wrongfully / suffre esely and thynke in thy herte that thou came naked in to this worlde & no better than naked shalt thou go away out of the worlde.  Also thynke vpon \u00fee wordes of the apostle where he sayth: Nought we brought in to this worlde and no thynge we may bere with vs / thynke vpon these wordes & I trowe they shall styre the moche to pacyence.  \u00b6 If thou be dysp[y]sed or defamed wrongfully / thynke vpon the wordes of cryst whan he sayd thus to his dyscyples: Ye be blessyd whan wycked men curse you or despyse you wrongfully, whan they pursyewe you or saye ony euyll makynge lesynges ayenst you wrongfully / Ioyeth than & be glad for your mede is plenteuous in heuen.  These wordes me thynketh sholde make the to suffre gladly despytes & euyll wordes.  It falleth somtyme that some mennes hertes be full grete & stoute by pryde & Inpacyence: But goddes seruauntes whan they se suche men so dyseased and trauayled in theyr soules, haue grete conpassyon of them knowynge wel that it cometh of vnstablenes of herte and of wycked sterynge of the flesshe / & therfore they suffre wycked & angry wordes for \u00fee tyme, hopynge \u00feat after so grete noyse shall come some maner ease & lownes of herte; they suffre also for \u00fee tyme for they knowe well it is full harde a man to ouercome hymselfe; / for thyse causes euery good man sholde gladly suffre angry wordes.  Also some men and women there be that wyll not suffre / but for one wycked worde they saye an other and take noo hede to the rewarde that they sholde haue of god yf they wolde suffre / suche men al daye fall in temptacyons for angre of herte and for inpacyence.  Therfore what euer thou be that art despysed of thy neyghbour, suffre gladly / & feyne the as thou herdest hym not / vnto the tyme that his herte be eased, and than yf it be suche mater that chargeth \u00feou mayst speke to hym in easy maner / and yf it is no chargynge than it is no force though thou holde thy peas and answere ryght nought.  Thus I haue shewed the examples for to styre the to pacyence, Fyrst how thou shalt gladly suffre the chastysynge of almyghty god as sykenes of body or ellys losse of goodes.  The seconde how thou shalt gladly suffre the temptacyons of the fende.  And the thyrde how thou shalt gladly suffre wronges and despysynges of thy neyghbour.  \u00b6 But now ouer all the ensamples I counseyll the for to haue one thynge specyall[y] in thy herte / the whiche shal be a generall ensample of pacyence to suffre gladly all maner trybulacyons for the loue of god: This ensample is for to haue euermore in thy mynde in eche dysease the grete pouerte, trybulacyon and the bytter passyon of Ihesu cryst goddes sone whiche he suffred gladly & wylfully for the loue of all mankynde.  \u00b6 Of this good lorde\n\n\n \n\nspeketh saynt Bernarde & sayth thus.  Cryst goddes sone of heuen frome the tyme \u00feat he came out of the gloryous maydens wombe Marye / had neuer but pouerte & trybulacyon tyll he went to suffre deth.  Whiche maner of deth it nedeth not at this tyme for to shewe it to the, For \u00feou hast it openly by \u00fee techynge of all holy chyrche.  Haue than sadly in thy mynde as moche as god wyll gyue the grace / how gladly, howe lowely & what he suffred for the / & \u00feat thought I trowe shall make the to wynne the vertue of pacyence / & to encreace in other vertues / & so forth within a whyle to come to the loue of god.  And now ferthermore for as moche as all \u00fee vertues be moost pleasynge & acceptable to god whiche be contynued & brought to good ende, therfore to strength \u00fee in these vertues I wyll shewe \u00fee now some wordes of \u00fee vertue of perseueraunce. Z  \u00b6 How perseueraunce is nedefull & how thou mayst be perseueraunt. PErseueraunce is fulfyllynge & ende of all vertues / keper of all goodnes / without whiche perseueraunce no man may se god.  But thou be perseueraunt / \u00feou mayst haue noo mede, thanke ne worshyp for thy seruyce.  Yf thou be perseueraunt thou shalt haue mede for thy true seruyce / & a grete rewarde for thy ghoostly trauayle & a worshypful crowne of vyctorye for thy stronge batayle.  Of this mater \u00feou hast before in \u00fee fyth poynt of the thyrde degree of loue / therefore at this tyme it nedeth not to speke but lytell more as of this purpose.  But I counseyll the in fewe wordes yf thou wylt be perseueraunt in goodnes that \u00feou trauaylest to wynne the vertue of pacyence wherof I haue touched somwhat in the last chapytre before.  For many men begynne full well and ende theyr lyfe full peryllously / & the cause is for the more partye Inpacyence / for they wyll not suffre gladly temptacyons & other trybulacyons; For whan they fele neuer so lytel dysease ghoostly or bodely anone they fall awaye from vertues & torne agayne to synne, And often it falleth that some men fall so sore that they deye by that fall / that is to saye they fall in to [so] grete sykenes & peryll of soule / that to our syght they deye in grete synne & errours without ony amendement. Of suche men speketh god almyghty & sayth:  No man \u00feat putteth his honde to the plowe & loketh behynde hym is dysposed to come to the kyngdom of heuen.  \u00b6 Here perauenture thou woldest aske what is he that holdeth the plowe & loketh behynde hym.  He putteth his honde to \u00fee plowe that amendeth his synnes with contrycyon & confessyon to brynge forth fruyte of penaunce & to encreace in vertues.  He loketh behynde hym that torneth agayne to synne[s] whiche were forsaken after tyme he had begonne good werkes.  Therfore what euer thou be that hast begonne to leue vyces / torne not agayne to them for a lytell dysease, yf thou wylt haue the grete mede that longeth to perseueraunce.  \u00b6 Also yf thou wylt be perseueraunt thou must be stable in herte / yf \u00feou wylt be stable in herte \u00feou must be ware of the lykynge & pleasynge of the worlde / & flee from wycked company / thou must take no hede to praysynges ne to blamynges / for of all these cometh vnstablenes, And yf thou haue ony lykynge in ghoostly werkes, that vnstablenes wyll put it awaye; therfore be ware & flee suche maner of occasyons yf thou wylt be stable.  \u00b6 I saye not that \u00feou shalt flee bodely from \u00fee world or fro [\u00fei] worldely goodes for they be pryncypall occasyons / but I\n\n\n \n\ncounseyll the in herte and in wyll that thou flee all suche vanytees.  For though \u00feou be lorde or lady / husbonde man or wyfe / thou mayst haue as stable an herte & wyll as some relygyous that sytte in the cloystres.  But sothe it is that the moost sykerest waye is to fle as relygyous do / but for all may not be men or women of relygyon / therfore of euery degre in \u00fee worlde god hath chosen his seruauntes.  What euer than thou be \u00feat wy[l]t come to \u00fee loue of god begynne fyrst to do good dedes with a good wyll and a contynuell desyre.  After that desyre fulfyl thy wyll in dede with dyscrecyon that thou mayst contynue to thy lyues ende.  Whan thou hast begonne thynke in thyn herte that god hath gyue the suche grace to begynne that thynge to his worshyp / thou mayst well do it yf thou wylt performe it in dede with the helpe of god.  After this poynte stande stably in wyll / aske grace of perseueraunce / and performe it in dede with a feruent spyryte.  And whan thou hast begonne dyscretly / though it be trauaylous in the begynnynge / all that trauayle be it in fastynges / wakynges / prayers or ony other ghoostly trauayle, all shall be lyght to the & shall torne the [to] in so grete myrthe and ghoostly conforte that thou shalt sette lytell by the passynge Ioye and the vanytees of the worlde.  Stande than stably in wyll and in dede / and god almyghty that hath begonne good werkes in the / wyll norysshe the forth in all vertues / defende the from thyn enemyes / teche the to loue hym / and kepe the in his loue to thy lyues ende; After this deth thou shalt not drede for thou shalt euer abyde in his kyngdome where that is no care ne drede / but all Ioye & conforte for euermore lastynge.  \u00b6 Now I haue shewed to the foure degrees of loue / & declared here fyue specyall vertues whiche as me thynketh be moost nedeful euery man for to haue that wyl trauayle in ghoostly werkes / & to al other maner men and women they be full spedefull to knowe whether they be relygyous or seculer.  And for as moche as many in the begynnynge haue full lytell sauour in deuoute prayers or in holy medytacions, some perauenture for tender age / & some for vnconnynge / therfore to suche symple folke I wyll shewe a maner forme how by medytacyon they may be styred to deuocyon / and what maner prayer shall be to theym nedefull. AB  \u00b6 By what prayer or thought thou mayst be styred to deuocyon. [W]Han thou ordeynest \u00fee to praye or haue ony deuocyon, founde to haue a preuy place from all maner noyse, & tyme of reste without ony lettynge.  Syt there or knele there as is moost to thyn ease.  Than be thou lorde or lady, thynke wel thou hast a good \u00feat made the of nought / whiche hath gyue to the thy ryght wyttes / ryght lymmes & other worldely ease more than to some other as \u00feou mayst se aldaye \u00feat lyue in grete dysease & moche bodely myschyef. Thynke also how synful thou art, & were not the kepynge of \u00feat good god thou sholdest fall in to all maner of synne by thyn owne wretchednes, & than \u00feou mayst thynke sothly as of thyself \u00feat there is none so synful as thou art.  Also yf \u00feou haue ony vertue or grace of good lyuynge thynke it cometh of goddes sendynge & nothynge of thyselfe.  Thynke also how longe & how often god hath suffred the in synne / he wolde not take the in to dampnacyon whan \u00feou haddest deserued it / but goodly hath abyden the tyll \u00feou woldest leue synne & torne to goodnes /\n\n\n \n\nfor loth hym were to forsake \u00feat he bought so dere with bytter paynes.  Also \u00feou mayst thynke for he wolde not lese the he became man & was borne of a mayde / in pouerte & trybulacyons all his lyfe he lyued, & after for thy loue deth he wolde suffre to saue the by his mercy.  \u00b6 In suche maner thou mayst thynke of his grete benefytes / and for the more grace to gete to the compunccyon beholde with thy ghoostly eye his pyteous passyon. \u00b6 A short medytacion of the passyon of our lorde Ihesu cryste. THou mayst here ymagyne in thy herte as yf \u00feou sawe thy lorde take of his enemyes with many repreues & despytes / brought before a Iuge / falsely there accused of many wycked men / & he answered ryght nought but mekely suffred theyr wordes.  They wolde nedes haue hym deed / but fyrst to suffre paynes. Beholde than that good lorde cheuerynge & quakynge all his body naked bounde to a pyler / about hym standynge wicked men without ony reason sore scorgynge \u00feat blessyd body without ony pyte.  Se how they cesse not from theyr angry strokes tyll they se hym stande in his blood vp to his ancles / from the toppe of his heed to the sole of his foot hole skynne they lefte none / his flesshe they rased to the bones / & for werynes of themselfe they lefte hym almoost dede.  Loke than asyde vpon his blessyd moder / se what sorow she made for her dere sone / & haue compassyon of her payne that laye there aswowne. Torne agayne to thy lorde & se howe they vnbynde hym / how hastly they drawe hym forth to do hym more dysease.  A garlonde of thornes they put vpon his heed tyll the blood ran downe in to his eyen / nose / mouth & eeres.  Than they kneled downe with scornes, & arose vp with repreue & spette in his face.  See than how \u00feat blessyd lady beteth her breste / draweth her clothes / & wryngeth her hondes / & I trowe thou wylt wepe for that pyteful syght.  \u00b6 Loke yet agayn to thy lorde & se how they hurle hym forth to an hyghe hylle there to nayle hym hande & foot vpon the rode tree.  Se than fyrst how fyersly they drawe of his clothes & how mekely that he than wente to the crosse / he spredeth his armes abrode / but strayter with cordes they drewe forth his armes tyl the synewes & the Ioyntes be all to-broke / & than with full grete nayles they nayled his precyous hondes to the crosse.  In the same maner thou mayst se how greuously they drawe his dereworthy legges and nayled his feet downe to the tree.  Se than how they profered hym for to drynke bytter galle & eysyll / and kneled agayn before hym with many despytes.  Than herken to that good lorde how mekely he taketh leue of his gracyous moder and of his dere apostle & betaketh them eyther to other as dere moder and sone.  Than with a grete voyce he commended his spyryte to his father in heuen / and hanged downe that blessyd heed ryght forth vpon his brest.  Se also how soone after they perced his herte thrugh with a spere with full grete anger, and ranne downe by his body medled blood & water.  Than mayst thou haue full grete pyte beholdynge that good lady how for sorowe she synketh downe in her systers armes.  Take hede to the chere of his apostle saynt Iohan, to the teres of Marye magdalene and of his other frendes / and I trowe amonge all these thou shalt haue com-\n\n\n \n\npunccion & plente of teres.  Whan there cometh suche deuocyon than is tyme that thou speke for thyn owne nede & for all other quycke or deed that trusten to thy prayer.  Caste downe thy body to the grounde & lyfte vp thy herte on hye with dreedfull chere / than make thy mone & yf thou wylt thou mayst thynke thus & saye:  A lord god almyghty blessyd mote thou be / \u00feou madest me / thou boughtest me / thy suffraunce is full grete in me / \u00feou woldest not take me in to dampnacyon that often I haue deserued / but thou hast kepte & saued me tyll I wolde forsake synne and torne hole to the.  Now lorde with sorowfull herte I knowleche to thy godhede that falsely I haue spended and without proufyte all my wyttes and vertues whiche thou hast gyuen me in helpynge of my soule all the tyme of my lyfe in dyuerse vanytees / all the lymmes of my body in synne & superfluytees / the grace of my crystendom in pryde & other wretchydnesse.  And sothly good lorde I haue loued other thynges moche more than the / & notwithstandynge my grete vnkyndenes euer thou hast nourysshed me and tenderly kepte me.  Of thy grete suffraunce I had full lytell knowynge / of thy grete ryghtwysnes I had but lytell drede.  I toke no hede to thanke \u00fee for thy grete goodnes / but al my lyfe from daye to daye grete mater of wrath I haue shewed to \u00fee thrugh myn owne wyckednes.  herfore lorde I wote not what I shall saye to the but onely this worde in whiche I trust:  God of thy grete mercy haue mercy on me / I wote well lorde all \u00feat I haue cometh onely of \u00fee / I wote well without the no thynge may be / but my synne & wretchydnes cometh all of me; wherfore lorde with meke herte I beseche thy grace do not to me as I haue deserued but after thy grete mercy / and sende me [\u00feat] grace of thyn holy ghoost to lyghten myn herte / to comforte my spyryte / to stable me in the ryght waye to performe thy commaundementes / that I may haue perseueraunce in that I haue begonne & that I be nomore departed from the by my vnstablenes or by temptacyons of myn enemye.  It is lorde yet ful worthy that I be chastysed for my wycked lyuynge with what rodde thy wyll is / welcome be thy sendynge. Pacyently good lorde sende me grace gladly to suffre thy chastysynge / comfort me amonge for thy grete grace / & whan thy wyll is withdrawe thy rodde & take me to thy mercy.  Full bytter be these temptacyons & full greuous to suffre / & though they be dredefull I wote well hereafter they shall be medefull to my soule / but good lorde \u00feou knowest well myn herte is ryght feble / moche is myn vnstablenes / my connynge is but lytell:  therfore good lorde strength me / stable me & teche me / [&] as \u00feou madest me & bought me so kepe & defende me / body & soule I take to the / no thynge after my wyll but as \u00feou wylt lorde so mote it be.  And now good Ihesu goddes sone knower of all thynge, helpe me in wycked thoughtes that I dysplease the not in ly[k]ynge ne in assentyng / efull often I haue dyspleased the in dyuerse thoughtes all ayenst thy wyll & moche to my lykynge, therfore it is thy ryghtwysnes that I be trauayled with other thoughtes at thyn ordynaunce & greuous to me / but curteys Ihesu whan thy wyl is put them awaye & take me in to thy grace.  Iesu cryst goddes sone whiche stode styll before \u00fee Iuge nothynge to hym answerynge / withdrawe my tongue tyll I thynke what & how I shall speke \u00feat may be to thy worshyp.  Ihesu goddes sone\n\n\n \n\nwhose hondes were bounde full sore for my loue / gouerne & wysshe myn hondes & al myn other lymmes that all my werkes may begynne & gracyously ende to thy moost pleasure.  Also lorde \u00feou seest well that many ther be that trust to my prayer for grace that ye shewe to me more than I am worthy / ye wote well lorde I am not suche as they wene, but though my prayer be vnworthy / take hede to theyr lownes & to theyr deuocion & what they desyre to your worshyp graunte it them for your goodnes.  Graunte them & me & to all other for whom we be bounde to praye grace to loue all that is to your lykynge / and you to loue to your moost pleasynge / nothynge to desyre that sholde dysplease you, All maner temptacyons myghtely to withstande / all other vanytees for your loue to despyse / you good lorde euer to haue in mynde / and in your seruyce for to abyde to our lyues ende.  And yf ye graunte vs ony thynge to doo that shall be to vs medefull / graunte parte to the soules whiche be departed from the body In the paynes of purgatorye abydynge your mercy Amen. \u00b6 In suche maner thou mayst praye in the begynnynge / & whan thou art well entred in to deuocyon thou shalt perauenture haue better felynge in prayers and in holy medytacyons otherwyse than I can saye or shewe.  Good broder or syster praye than for me whiche by the techynge of almyghty god haue wryten to the these fewe wordes in helpynge of thy soule. A Good curteys aungell ordeyned to my gouernale, I knowe well my feblenes & my vnconnynge / also well I wote \u00feat strength haue I none to do goddes seruyce but onely of his gyfte & of your besy kepynge.  The connynge \u00feat I haue cometh no thynge of me but what god wyll sende me by your good entysynge.  Now good gracyous aungel I aske you lowely mercy / for lytell hede I haue taken of your good besynes; but now I thanke you as I can, with full herte besechynge you \u00feat ye kepe me truely this daye & euermore slepynge & wakynge with syker defendynge & your holy techynge.  Defende me & kepe me from bodely harmes, defende me and kepe me from ghoostly peryles to goddes worshyp & sauynge of my soule.  Teche me & wysshe me my wyttes for to dyspende moost to goddes worshyp & pleasynge.  Fede me with deuocyon & sauour of ghoostly swetnes / conforte me whan nede is ayenst my ghoostly enemyes & suffre me not to lese \u00feat grace that is graunted me / but of your worthy offyce kepe me in goddes seruyce to my lyues ende.  And after \u00fee passynge of the body presente my soule vnto the mercyfull god.  For though I fall aldaye by myn owne freelte you I take in wytnes \u00feat euer I hope in mercy.  Gladly wolde I worshyp the & I myght to your lykynge therfore god to worshyp for you / you also in hym after his holy techynge.  I thanke hym with this holy prayer.  \u00b6 Pater noster.  Et ne nos.

Wynkyn de Worde, 1508 and 1519", "2": "Four profitable things \u00b6 Here after foloweth foure proufytable thynges to haue in mynde, whiche hath be taken out of \u00fee thyrde chapiter of a deuoute treatyse & a fourme of lyuinge that the dyscrete & vertuous Richard hampole wrote to a deuoute & an holy persone for grete loue. THe fyrst:  mesure of thy lyf whiche is so shorte that vnnethes it is ony thynge / for we lyue here but in a poynte that is the leest thynge \u00feat may be. And for to saye sothe, our lyfe is lesse than a poynte yf we sholde lyken it to the lyfe euerlastynge. / An other thynge is the vncertaynte of our endynge / for we wote not whan we shall dye nor how we shall dye nor whether we shall goo whan we be deed.  And the wyll of god is that it be to vs vncertayne / for he wylleth that we be alwaye redy to dye. / The thyrde is \u00feat we shall answere before the ryghtwyse Iuge of all the tyme \u00feat we haue ben here, how we haue lyued / what our occupacyon hath be / and what good we myght haue done whan we haue ben ydle.  Therfore \u00fee prophete sayd:  he hath called the tyme ayenst me / that is for euery day he hath lente vs here to spende in good vse as in penaunce and in goddes seruyce.  And yf we waste it in erthly loue and vanytees, full greuously must we be demed and punysshed.  Therfore it is one of the moost sorowes \u00feat may be to vs / but yf we enforce vs to the contrary / & set our herte to the loue of god, And doo good to all that we may in \u00fee shorte whyle that our tyme lasteth.  For eche tyme \u00feat we thynke not of god we may counte it as loste. / The fourth is that we thynke how moche the Ioye is that they shall haue whiche contynueth in the loue of god to theyr endynge / for they shall be bretherne & felowes with aungelles, seynge the kynge of Ioye in his beauty and shynynge maieste the whiche shall be to them aboue all the delytes that ony creature may thynke.  Than, to remembre the grete and intollerable sorowe, payne & turmentes whiche they shal haue that loueth not god aboue all thynge as we may se in this worlde many of that dysposycyon whiche set all theyr pleasure in lust and lykynge of this lyf / as in pryde / couetyse / and other synnes / they shall brenne in the fyre of helle with the deuyll whome they serued as longe as god is in heuen with his seruauntes that lasteth euer. \u2014", "3": "The remedy ayenst the troubles of temptacyons A translation of William Flete's De remediis contra temptaciones . \u00b6 Here foloweth and enseweth a souerayne notable sentence to comforte a persone that is in temptacyon. OUr mercyfull lorde god cryst Ihesu chastyseth his chyldren and suffreth them to be tempted for many proufytable causes to theyr soules helth / & therfore\n\n\n \n\nsholde noo man nor woman be heuy or sory for ony temptacyon.  For as saynt Iames the appostle techeth vs we sholde haue very greate Ioye whan we be tempted with dyuers temptacyons / for as the golde is pured and purged by the fyre / and a knyght in batayle is proued good:  ryght so is a man by temptacyon proued for good / but yf he suffre hymselfe to be ouercome / that is to saye but he consent therto by delyberacyon.  For sothely whan a man is sharpely tempted he may than haue hope of gr[et]e vertue / and it is necessary for a man moche to be troubled with temptacyons / for euery vertue is proued by his contrarye. Our enemy the fende is besy daye and nyght to tary and trauayle good men and women with dyuers temptacyons / in doubtes of the fayth and dredes of saluacyon and other many moo in dyuers maners, and specyally now in these dayes he is full besy to deceyue many soules / and therfore wysely rule you to withstande his vyolent sterynges of temptacyon / & for all that take ye noo dredes of his assawtes / ne haue ye ony doubte of his erroures ne dyspytes nor of his false leasynges or fantasyes or ony maner of trauayle of that foule fende; whether ye here hym / se hym or thynke of hym take noo hede therof / for all be maters of grete mede and noo synne in noo wyse be they neuer soo troublous or full of anguysshes whyles it cometh of the malyce of the fende or of euyll dysposycyon of mannes nature or compleccyon.  And therfore all suche trauayle men ought not to charge but suffre mekely and abyde pacyently tyll god doo remedy therto. And for as moche as they be maters of grete mede none ought to stryue there agaynst / nor meruayle of them ne seke the cause nor thynke by what skyll he is soo trauaylled / for the more that a man laboureth in sechynge and thynkynge of suche anguysshes the more depely he falleth in to errours / and therfore in as moche as mannes thought is often vayne and dyuers and none ende hath:  it ought not to be forced or be taken hede of / ne a man sholde not angre hymselfe therwith ne blame ne impute it to his owne defaute that he is so troubled / for suche trauaylles ben paynefull but not synfull in soo moche as they be gretely agaynst his wyll.  Saynt Augustyne sayth that euery synne lyeth in wylfull wyll, And what that is agaynst mannes wyll is noo synne.  And the holy doctour ysodore de summo bono sayth that the fende tempteth a man noo more than god gyueth hym leue.  Therfore let vs haue alway a good wyll to wyll well and doo well / and god wyll kepe vs and gyue vs the vyctory / & so the fende shall be confounded. Fayth & hope is grounde of all perfeccyon and rote of all vertue / and therfore our olde enemy the fende is full besy with all his sleyghtes to drawe the soule downe therfro, And it happeth somtyme that the fende tempteth and trauaylleth a ryghtwyse soule so sharpely that it is ouerlayde with care and dryuen to dyspayre:  and yet all that tyme though the soule perceyue it not it dwelleth styll in the drede and loue of god / and all that trauayle is to theyr grete mede afore god / for our lorde of his endles mercy arrecteth not to \u00fee soule that synne whiche hymselfe suffreth the fende to werke in the soule without the consente or wyll of the sayd selfe soule.  But whan we wylfully doo ayenst the wyll of god with delyberacyon than we commytte synne actually.  But whan we be drawen with wycked vyolence or vyle thoughtes & turmented with dyspayre ayenst our\n\n\n \n\nwyll thorugh the fendes vyolent temptynge we suffre payne but we do no synne / & yet the sely soules knowlege is hydde by that turment. \u00b6 The seconde chapytre. BUt yet ryght often the temptynge of the fende that maketh the soule to erre in fayth and foule fantasye & in dyspayre:  semeth to the selfe soule grete synne / but it is not soo.  For all holy doctours sayth that fayth and hope be vertues of mannes wyll / wherfore who so wolde ryghtwysly byleue in this lyf:  he is in ryght byleue before god / and lykewyse who so wolde here trustly hope he is in trusty hope before god / though he be neuer so moche troubled with ferefull thoughtes.  The appostle saynt Poule sayth that in a mannes blyleue is wylfull byleue of ryghtwysnes; Of the whiche wordes sayth the glose that all onely in mannes wyll whiche may not be constrayned lyeth bothe mede and gylte / that is to saye:  a man afore god hath neuer mede ne gylte for no dede but onely of the dedes that be done wylfully.  But somtyme mannes thought[es] and womans be soo troubled and ouerlayde that they knowe not theyr owne wyll / & yet though it soo be they ought not to care.  For good dedes sheweth alwaye good wyll / and euyll dedes euyll wyll, wherfore a man that dooth in dede the seruyce of god that man hath a good wyll to god / though his trauaylous herte deme the contrarye.  Also there sholde noo creature deme his euencrysten for ony doubtfull fantasyes / but yf they haue a very open knowlege of that thynge whiche they sholde deme hym for:  Than it is euyll and vnreasonable for ony creature to deme his owne soule in that plyght, that he sholde be parted from god for ony doubtfull fantasye. \u00b6 The thyrde chapytre. ANd than yf it so be ye haue consented & fallen to synne by ony temptacions / than be sory and crye god mercy therof.  And yet be ye not dyscomforted but thynke well on the grete mercy of god how he forgaue Dauid his grete synnes, Peter & Magdalene, and not onely them / but also all those that haue ben or now be or shall be contryte for theyr synnes & meke them lowly and crye our lorde mercy.  And therfore syster flee to hym that all mercy is in / and aske mercy & ye shall haue it with forgyuenes of all your synnes / and meke you lowly & take the sacramentes of holy chirche / & than ye ought to byleue faythfully that your synnes be forgyuen / and that ye be receyued in to the grace of god.  For god sayth hymselfe by his prophete Ezechiel that whan a synfull man soroweth for his synnes he wyll neuer haue mynde therof.  & yf a man perceyue in his herte no very sorowe / and though he thynke whan he byddeth his bedes or cryeth to god for mercy that he dooth all ayenst herte:  yet therfore sholde he not deme hymselfe graceles / for who so wolde haue very sorowe for his synnes or wold crye god mercy for them or in his herte wold crye for mercy:  he cryeth god mercy truly / for as I haue sayd before / god taketh hede to mannes wyll & not to his trauayllous fantasyes / it is good that a man take noo hede of suche fantasyes or sterynges that cometh in suche maner.  For god hydeth from them the knowleges of suche fantasyes for many causes vnto the\n\n\n \n\nproufyte of theyr soules / wherfore suche passyons be not synfull / but rather mater of grace and of grete meryte.  And soo good syster thynke ye alwaye / and yf it be soo that temptacyon cease not but wexe alwaye more & more be not afrayed but saye somtyme amonge in the worshyp of god and in the spyte of the fende your crede and knowlege your byleue and hope [by mouthe], and thynke on the wordes of saynt Poule that sayth:  Knowlege of mouth is done to the helpe of soules; and they shall not be deceyued by the fendes whyles that with a good auysement bothe in worde and wyll withstandeth hym strongly.  For there was neuer man deceyued of the fende but by consent of his owne wyll / & that with suche a wyll as the herte consented with the same / for other fantastycall troublous wylles putteth not awaye man from god. \u00b6 The fourth chapytre. ANd therfore sholde noo man care nor be heuy that he is so troubled more than an other.  Syster alwaye whan I speke of a man in this wrytynge take it bothe for man and woman / for so it is ment in all suche wrytynge / for all is mankynde:  and ferthermore as touchynge your troubles thynke in all your dyseases what troubles goddes seruauntes hath suffred and what paynes and turmentes they haue had here in this worlde in many sondry maners and ye shall fynde cause to suffre.  Leo the pope sayth / it happeth somtyme that good and ryghtwyse soules be styred sharpely by the fende / & somtyme by theyr owne compleccyon to angers, troubles, dredes & suche other taryenges that it semeth to them theyr lyf a turment, in so moche that somtyme for very drede the[y] begyn to dyspayre bothe in lyfe of body and soule / thynkynge they be forsaken of god / whiche dooth it but to assaye and proue his chosen chyldren and frendes by suche temptacyons.  For as I afore haue sayd at the begynnynge of this wrytyng, in lyke maner as fyre purgeth golde and as a knyghte is proued good and hardy by batayle:  ryght so temptacyons and troubles purgeth a ryghtwyse soule; this is proued well by Toby / for the aungell Raphaell sayd this to hym:  Toby for as moche as thou arte ryghtfull to god it is nedefull that temptacyon sholde preue thy wyll.  And well it is knowen that sykenes falleth to a man after the dysposycyon of his compleccyon:  So lyke wyse temptacyon, as Leo the pope sayth: The fende our ghostly enemy aspyeth in euery man what wyse he is dysposed by his compleccyon / and by that disposicyon he tempteth hym.  For there as he fyndeth a man full of malencoly he tempteth hym moost with ghoostly temptacyons of Ire.  But they that wyll attende to withstande it for the loue of god they must shape them to pacyence & saye with Iob:  Sythen we haue receyued of god so grete benefaytes why sholde we not receyue and suffre dyseases.  And thynke on the grete anguysshes, sorowes and dyseases that our lorde Ihesu cryste suffred hymselfe here in erth, And also suffred his blyssed moder to haue the same.  And thynke that to suffre dysease pacyently is the waye to heuen-warde. And that ye may not in this frayle worlde be so free as an aungell that is confermed by grace / but whyle your body and soule be togyder in this lyf they must receyue troubles as well as eases.  And thynke not that god hath forsaken\n\n\n \n\nyou:  but mekely abyde the comforte of hym and without doubte whan it nedeth ye shal not fayle therof.  But some men whan they haue drede of saluacyon or be tempted to dyspayre by vysyons or ghostly sterynges of theyr owne frayltye / they wene anone that they haue synned in the synne of the holy ghoost / and than the fende putteth in them that they may neuer be saued nor forgyuen of theyr trespaces.  Thus speketh the fende within them, so ferynge s[um]e good creatures that they wene to goo out of theyr myndes.  But [ye] that ben thus tempted answere the fende thus agayne that he is false and a lyer as his nature is to be.  For the synne of the holy ghoost as clerkes sayth is infynyte without repentaunce.  And that is whan a man wylfully by delyberacyon wyll neuer repente nor aske god mercy ne forgyuenes of his synnes / nor wyll be tourned / but wylfully departeth hym from the goodnes of god / and in [t]his wretchednes abydeth wylfully with full consent of wyll; he that doth thus synneth in the holy ghoost whiche may not be forgyuen here nor elles where / for he wyll not trust in the goodnes of the holy ghoost nor aske forgyuenes of his synnes, And therefore he that wyll noo mercy aske noo mercy shall haue / for his synnes be infynyte without repentaunce.  But thoughe a man or a woman haue or fele all these vycyous sterynges and as many moo as ony herte can thynke ayenst theyr owne free wyll, and whan reason cometh to them they be sory therof & flee alwaye hastely to the mercy of god:  it is to them but a preuynge or a clensynge of theyr synnes though they be neuer soo ofte in the nyght and the daye now vp now downe as wrestlers be / & thoughe ye haue ony tyme fall in ony synne ghoostly or flesshely & layne therin wylfully by delyberacyon and full content of herte:  ye than ought to be sory and aske god forgyuenes with as grete contrycyon as god wyll gyue you grace / and than thynke fully the goodnes of the holy ghoost surmounteth all synnes that euer was done or euer shall be done / [for] though a man had synned in them all / as well in dede as thought / he beynge truly contryte & confessed mekynge hymselfe lowly to almyghty god and to his sacramentes of holy chyrche / doubte ye not he so askynge mercy shall haue full forgyuenes of all his synnes / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes.  And therfore thoughe ye somtyme here by spekynge or elles of wrytynge or redynge in bokes sharpe wordes and harde sentences:  yet comforte your selfe and thynke well that all suche harde wordes be sayd and wryten to chastyse the synners and to withdrawe them from euyll / and also to pourge and pure goddes specyall louers as the metall is in the fyre afore rehersed / and in them god wyll make his hous.  And wete it well many wordes that seme full harde be ment full tenderly whan they be well vnderstonde / and though some wordes be ment ryght hardely as the playne texte sheweth / yet sholde ye not take them to you-warde / but comforte your selfe and thynke that all those harde sentences shall be fulfylled in Iewes and sarasyns / for the crysten people that wyll be contryte & trust in goddes mercy or haue a wyl so for to do:  they shal escape all perylles / so \u00feat they shall not perysshe but be saued / where as the Iewes & sarasyns in theyr perylles shal vtterly persysshe to pardycyon / for they\n\n\n \n\nhaue not the strength of Baptym ne the precyous oyntement of crystes passyon / that sholde gyue to theyr soules lyf and helth.  Of this [we] haue example & a grete fygure in holy wryte that where as Moyses ledde the chyldren of Israell ouer the reed see whiche were goddes people, Moyses wente before them and smote the water with his rodde and therwith the water parted & the chyldren of Israell wente ouer in suertye, And they of egypte that folowed perysshed & were drowned.  By Moyses I vnderstonde our lorde Ihesu cryste / and by the yerde or rodde that departed \u00fee water I vnderstonde his holy passyon / and by the chyldren of Israell that were not perysshed all crysten people:  for ryght so our lorde Ihesu cryst came from his faders bosome to the see of trybulacyons & temptacyons to be our guyde & leder / he gooth before vs with his precyous passyon & smyteth awaye the perylles of our troublous temptacyons / so that we shall not perysshe / but it shall brynge vs to suertye of euerlastynge lyf; and therfore gyue we to hym thankynges, louynges & infynyte praysynges as the chyldren of Israell dyde.  For thoughe a crysten man were neuer soo synfull thynkynge hymselfe \u00feat he stode in the sentence of the hardest wordes that be wryten:  yet sholde he trust faythfully in the mercy of god / for and he wyll forsake his synnes & tourne hym to good and vertuous lyf:  he shall haue grace and forgyuenes / and the harde sharpe wordes of dampnacyon sholde tourne hym to mercy and saluacyon.  For thus sayth our lord god in holy wryte by his prophete Ieremye: though I make grete thretes I shall repent me of my wordes yf my people wyll repent them of theyr synnes.  O beholde the grete goodnes of our lorde / and how pyte alwaye constrayneth hym to mercy, worshyp and thankes be euer to his goodnes; he is so benygne and mercyfull to them that be repentaunt that he frely wyll chaunge his sentences from sharpe vengeaunce to forgyuenes / & of the paynes that they be worthy to suffre / gyue them alygeaunce or lyghter payne to suffre.  He sayth also by the prophete I saye:  I shall forgyue the synnes of euery man that with very true contrycyon wyll drawe hym to good and vertuous lyfe.  And this grete mercy shewed our lorde openly vpon the Cyte of Niniue / and also by kynge E&yogh;echie.  Therfore lette noo man dyspayre but alwaye trust fully to goddes mercy that so well can redresse our myscheues and tourne all our woo to wele / and our sorowe to Ioye.  O thou gloryous [&] myghtyfull god that thus meruayllously werketh in thy creatures, it is to se that thy mercy is large and brode whiche maketh the to chaunge thy sentence that before was bothe thy wyll and worde / blessyd be thou good lorde in all thy vertues for thou canst / may / and wyll tourne and chaunge all our infyrmytees to our moost proufyte yf we wyll not flee from the / but tourne to thy goodnes and aske mercy.  But for all this grete goodnes / god forbede that ony man sholde be the more bolder to synne, or wylfully and wyttyngly by delyberacyon sholde presume to falle to synne vpon trust of [his] mercy; and [for] our lorde is so mercyfull I surely trust that euery true courteys soule wyl be the more lothe to offende his goodnes. [But] as for you that be tempted ayenst your wyll / and wyll not for all the worlde dysplease god wylfully:  but that ye be thus begyled and encombred by the fende with many paynefull thoughtes / be ye not afrayde of the fende nor of his fere-\n\n\n \n\nfull assawtes / for he is full sore dyscomforted whan that he seeth a man or a woman whiche he soo tempteth is not aferde of hym.  Somtyme the fende cometh and tempteth a soule fyersly lyke a dragon / and somtyme he assaylleth hym lyke a rampynge lyon; but and yf a creature strength hymselfe saddely in the passyon of almyghty god / and arme hym with that holy passyon / a thousande suche fendes how someuer that they come shall haue noo more power ouer hym thenne hath as many flyes or gnattes.  And therfore strength you all in god / and be not abasshed soo to strength and arme you in hym though ye be synfull / for he sayth hymselfe in the gospell he came for synners.  And in an other place of the gospell he saythe that he came for mercy and not for noo vengeaunce / and to be our shelde and strength; and so lette vs humbly with a meke herte take hym.  And yf ye fele ony dredes by ymagynacyon or temptacyon or for wordes that ye haue herde or redde in bookes by the whiche ye doubte of saluacyon / than thynke on the wordes that cryste hymselfe taught to a man that doubted / sayenge and askynge of our lorde who sholde be saued / for he thoughte it was to harde to hymselfe for to eschewe all the poyntes that ledde man to pardycyon.  And our lorde badde hym for to saye Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem creatorem celi et terre, Et in iesum christum filium eius, Byleue sayd our lorde Ihesu that god the fader is almyghty and that no thynge to hym is impossyble but that he may forgyue all synnes and redresse all wronges and brynge the soules to his blysse.  and thynke ferthermore that his myght and power may do all that his wysdome can / and his goodnes wyl / and therfore truste fully that by his goodnes he wyll saue you and brynge you to euerlastynge Ioye whan he seeth best tyme / for he hath bought you full dere with his precyous blode and paynefull deth.  And I dare sauely saye that there is none so synfull a caytyf whiche is crystened or wolde be crystened this daye on the erthe all thoughe he were in the syght of god dampnable and in the syght of all creatures also, ye and yet were Iuged to be dampned by all scrypture, and he wolde forsake his synne and be contryte and aske god forgyuenes he sholde haue mercy and forgyuenes of hym / & yf it were so that he stode in that case or had a good mynde to stonde so in the tyme of deth he sholde be saued / the myght & mercy of god is so grete that it surmounteth all his lawes, Iugementes and scryptures. And so our lorde Ihesus sheweth vs by an example in the gospell of a woman that was founde in aduoutry and by Moyses lawe whiche was ordeyned by god \u00feat she sholde be stoned to the deth:  But the myght and the wysdome of that blessyd lorde god was soo gretely shewed to the phary&yogh;ens whiche accused her that they so largely perceyued theyr synnes that they myght not for shame deme her but stale awaye out of the temple, And our lorde Ihesu wolde not deme her but of his gracyous mercy forgaue her all her synnes.  And therfore be a man or woman neuer soo synfull and that they fele neuer soo many bodely and ghostly synnes alwaye rysynge and sterynge within them / they sholde neuer the rather dyspayre of the mercy of god / ne be dyscomforted.  For there as moche synne is / there is shewed moche mercy and grace / and the goodnes of god is knowen by the forgyuenes of the synne whan a body turneth hym there-from and is very\n\n\n \n\ncontryte; but god forbede as I sayd before that ony creature be the more recheles or bolde to synne wylfully / for in so moche the mercy of god is so large we ought to be the more besy and dylygent to loue and prayse hym.  Almyghty god werketh lyke a leche / for a leche suffreth somtyme the deed flesshe to growe on hym that he hath in cure / but afterwarde he taketh away the same and maketh the quycke flesshe to growe / and soo he heleth the pacyent.  Ryght soo dooth our lorde Ihesu cryste maker of heuen and erth, suffreth somtyme a man or a woman to fall in deedly synne:  but afterwarde of his grete mercy and pyte he putteth-to his hande of grace / for they that were deedly wounded thorough synne he heleth them and wassheth away theyr synnes with the water of his well of mercy / & maketh in them quycke vertues to growe wherby he gyueth to theym euerlastynge lyfe.  Oure lorde god is also lyke a gardyner:  for a gardyner suffreth somtyme wycked wedes to growe in his gardyn / and whan the erth thorugh moysture of rayne wexeth tender he taketh & pulleth awaye the wedes bothe rote & rynde.  So in lyke wyse dooth our lorde Ihesu cryst, he suffreth somtyme in his gardyn whiche is mannes soule wycked dedes of synne to growe / but whan the herte of man wexeth tender by mekenes and moysture of contrycyon he than taketh away all the synnes bothe rote and rynde and planteth and setteth in his gardyn herbes and fruytes of good vertues / and watreth them with the dewe of his blessyd goodnes / wherby the soule of man shall come to euerlastynge Ioye and reste.  Now than sythen our lorde god is so good, so pyteous and soo mercyfull to synners that wylfully offendeth hym by commyttynge of horryble synnes / moche more he is mercyfull and hath pyte and compassyon of a soule that thorughe trouble and temptacyons falleth to synne / for almyghty god suffreth often tymes the soule of man for to be tempted and vexed in withstandynge temptacyons / wherof it deserueth the more meryte.  And therfore be ye not doubtefull nor heuy for it shall neuer tourne you to peryll ne daunger but to grete proufyte.  For therby ye shall wynne the crowne of glorye and the palme of vyctorye whiche shall be gyuen to you for withstandynge of suche temptacyons & to the fende it shall tourne to shame and confusyon; and though it semeth to you somtyme that ye fele dyscorde bytwene god and you be not therfore recreaunt ne dyscomforted, For almyghty god sayth by his prophete Isaye: A lytell whyle I haue forsaken and hydde my face from the:  but I shall call the to me agayne by my ma[ny]folde mercyes whiche euer shall endure. \u00b6 The fyfte chapytre. ANnd therfore grutche not agaynst the wyll of god ne meruayle not of these temptacyons / for the more that a man or a woman be tempted in this maner or in ony other agaynst theyr wyll and they withstande it that is to saye not wyllyngly consentynge therto but mekely suffreth the same:  the more they shall encreace in vertues to the proufyte of theyr soules in the syght of god thoughe it be hydde from them.  For perauenture whan ye be sharpely tempted ye thynke ye be to dull and neglygent in ghoostly excercyse thorughe wyckednes of your spyryte that is sore trauayled and vexed / wherby ye thynke that ye haue [in] wyll consented to suche temptacyons as ye be tempted with; but it is not so.\n\n\n \n\nFor ye shall vnderstonde that euery man and woman hath two wylles, a good wyll and an euyll / the euyll wyll cometh of sensualyte the whiche is euer inclynynge downwarde to synne / and the good wyll cometh of grace whiche alwaye styreth the soule vpwarde to all goodnes; and [for] whan reason cometh to you ye haue alwaye a good wyll to do well / & [ar] myscontent with all euyl thoughtes & sterynges that ye fele / and putteth your wyll onely to the wyll of god:  though ye thrugh suche wycked thoughtes & sterynges by vyolence and sharpnes be enclyned to sensualyte yet ye do it not ne consent therto but it is the sensualyte that dooth it in you / and your good wyll abydeth in you styll vnbroken though the cloudes of euyll thoughtes stoppeth your syght from the felynge of your good wyll:  as ye may se by ensample of the mone / for the mone shyneth alwaye in her dewe place as well whan we se her as whan we se her not, But oftentymes the cloudes shadoweth and putteth from vs the syght therof; and so in lyke wyse it fareth by your good wyll whiche standeth alwaye vnbroken in you by the grace of almyghty god though ye fele it not thrugh trauayllous thoughtes whiche taketh awaye the syghte of your knowlege.  Therfore ye good chyldren that sharpely be vexed with suche temptacyons & tribulacions, comforte yourselfe in your benygne & mercyfull fader that sayth to you by his prophete in holy wryte:  my chyldren though ye go in \u00fee fyre drede ye not / for \u00fee flambe therof shall not trouble you.  As who sayth ye that be crysten people wyllyng to do well, though ye goo in the fyre of trybulacyons & temptacyons drede you not for it shall tourne you to no peryll / but thorugh my goodnes & the merytes of my passyon it shall tourne you to grete proufyte & comforte of your soule. The maner of all these temptacions & \u00fee remedyes of \u00fee same sheweth our sauyour Ihesu cryst to his apostle saynt Peter as it appereth in \u00fee gospel where he sayth thus:  Peter sathanas asketh & desyreth to syfte the as men syfte whete / wherby it appereth well \u00feat the fende hath no myght ne power to attempte \u00fee seruauntes of almyghty god but by his suffraunce / & that was euydently knowen by the temptacyons of Iob whome the fende besyfted and tempted.  For \u00fee more \u00feat whete is syfted & cast from syde to syde the more clene it is:  Ryght so the more \u00feat a man or a woman be tempted with the fende ayenst theyr wyll / the more clene they be afore god / wherfore it appereth playnly \u00feat almyghty god suffreth not his seruauntes to be tempted but for theyr grete wele & profyte yf they purpose them-selfe myghtely to withstande the fendes temptacyon; whiche no man may withstande without the helpe of god, Therfore of his helpe he maketh vs sure lyke as he sayd to peter these wordes:  I haue prayed for the that thy fayth fayle the not.  And therfore that man whiche pacyently is redy to suffre all troubles and dyseases for the loue of his maker almyghty Ihesu not takynge hede of all the fendes mocyons and temptacyons:  that man thrugh the myght and grace of cryst bereth downe and ouercometh the fende / wherby he may be called a vaynquyssher or ouercomer.  And to suche men may be sayd thus:  thou that arte thus tourned to almyghty god by the vertue of pacyence / but yf thou helpe to counseyle & conferme thy bretherne And teche them to suffre as the grace of god hath taught the:  or elles thou arte vnkynde.  For Salamon sayth that one brother well counseylled & confermed by an other is a myghty Cyte ayenst the\n\n\n \n\nfende / and therfore they that be sharpely trauaylled and tempted, whan they haue had the good counseyle of theyr brother they ought to take comforte to them sayenge with Dauid whiche sayth:  O my soule why arte thou so vnstedfast thus to assayle and trouble me:  trust onely to almyghty god that is full of benygnyte and mercy, whome I onely confesse and knowelege to serue be I neuer so sore trauaylled ne troubled.  And to suche men thus vexed with thoughtes, mocyons & sterynges is behouefull to take the counseyle and techynge of the wyse and dyscrete persones fleynge vtterly theyr owne wylde fantasyes whiche often tymes gretely troubleth them.  And in eschewynge of suche temptacyons and troubles they must gyue themselfe to good & vertuous occupacyons / as to redynge and sayenge the seruyce of almyghty god / and doynge other vertuous dedes / and euer amonge prayenge to almyghty god they may haue strength in theyr soules to resyste suche mocyons and temptacyons.  And though they fynde in themselfe noo maner of swetenes ne sauour in goddes seruyce:  yet they ought not to be heuy therfore yf theyr wyll and mynde be to fulfyll the same.  For as holy wryte sayth euery good wyl is accepted for the dede.  Saynt Barnarde sayth that somtyme god withdraweth deuocyon from prayer to make the prayer more medefull / for he wyll be serued somtyme in bytternes and somtyme in swetenes whiche bothe two we muste mekely receyue.  And therfore Arystotle sayth that with the more dyffyculte and trauayle vertuous ben goten:  the more they proufyte and encrease in the soule. It was no maystry for saynt Peter whan he sawe almyghty god on the hyll of blysse, to saye / lorde it is good for vs to dwell here.  But afterwarde whan he sawe hym amonges his enemyes cruelly turmented a womans worde fered and put hym in suche drede that he forsoke and denyed his mayster.  But whan thorugh the myght of the holy ghoost he was reconsyled and confermed agayne: than was there no turment in erth that kinge or prynce put vnto hym coude fere hym.  Ryght so yf a man be in perfyte rest and quyetnes of herte / it is no maystry for hym to serue god:  But it is a maystary to hym that is in trauayle and out of quyetnes of herte to serue hym.  Therfore that creature that is tempted or vexed in the seruyce of almyghty god and is in wyll to withstande the sayd temptacyons tyll he after be strengthed and comforted by the holy ghost the fende shall neuer haue power to fere ne put hym in drede / for though it be longe or he fele comforte yet let not hym drede / for our mercyfull sauyour knoweth what tyme comforte is moost nedefull to hym [&] than he fayleth not to gyue it hym.  For somtyme the felynge of swetnes is withdrawen from man or elles he sholde wexe proude and presumtuous or neglygent and recheles in vertuous lyuynge / and therfore it is withdrawen for the best to the helth of his soule / wherfore hardnes and sharpenes sente to a creature is full proufytable to the soule:  as saynt Austyn sayth in techynge vs of the maner of almyghty god that whan a man is feble and newly tourned to hym he gyueth hym peas and swetnes to the entent to stablysshe hym in his lawe and loue / But whan he is stablysshed and sadly grounded in his loue:  than suffreth he hym to be vexed and trauaylled, for two reasons / one is to proue hym and to crowne hym the hyer in the blysse of heuen, An other is to pourge hym of his synnes in this worlde that in noo wyse he be from hym in the euerlastynge worlde. \u00b6 The syxte chapytre. ANd for as moche as many men can not nor wyll not in tyme of temptacion se or perceyue it but haue a dredefulnes and a sorynes in themselfe by sterynge of theyr compleccyon / therfore to all suche men thre thynges be nedefull & necessarye.  The fyrst is that they be not moche alone.  The seconde is that they thynke ne study to depely in ony one thynge / but fully ordre them by some dyscrete persone as afore I sayd / and thoughe it come in theyr mynde that they sholde be in Ieopardye or peryll vtterly to be lost:  they sholde take no hede of suche sterynges or thoughtes / for it neuer may tourne them to daunger of theyr soules.  Almyghty god sayth in the gospell:  yf the entent of a mannes purpose be good the dede is good.  The thyrde remedye is this / that for as moche as the fende laboureth to make a man dredefull and sorye / a man agayne ought to the honour of god and confusyon of the fende to strength hymselfe and be mery though it be ayenst his herte / and drede noothynge the fendes malyce.  For the lesse gladnes that he feleth in hymselfe the more meryte he shall haue whan he so enforceth hymselfe to be mery to the honour of god / and in spyte of his ghoostly enemy the deuyll.  For as holy wryte sayth the holy appostles wente awaye mery & gladde whan the Iues enemyes of god had shamefully beten them. Also a man ought to be gladde for thre causes whan the fende tempteth and turmenteth hym:  The fyrst is that he is troubled by the enemy of god.  The seconde is by suche temptacyons and turmentes the fende sheweth playnly that he is his enemye, and euery man ought to be gladde that goddes enemy is his enemy. And the thyrde is that by suche turmentes a man is not onely released of the paynes in purgatorye but also it maketh hym to wynne euerlastynge blysse.  Our lorde Ihesu sayth in the gospell:  blessyd be they that suffreth persecucyon for ryghtwysnes for they shall haue the kyngdome of heuen. \u00b6 The seuenth chapytre. ALso it is to vnderstonde that our olde enemy the fende is ofte tymes aboute to begyle mannes soule in dyuers and many maners / somtyme he styreth man vnder colour of goodnes to deceyue hym whan he is well dysposed, and specyally in thre thynges whiche I wyll speke of.  One is that though a creature be it man or woman be neuer so well ne soo ofte shryuen / yet the fende maketh them byleue they are not well shryuen / and that he dooth to brynge the soule in heuynes / and so anoyeth & troubleth the poore soule that he maketh hym to forgete what he wolde saye / & therby maketh hym out of rest tyll he be newly shryuen agayne.  But this doth he not for that he wolde that ony were often and well shryuen:  but fully to lette and trouble hym / and to make hym byleue that he were blynded by synne and out of grace wherfore he myght not make hymselfe clene.  The seconde whyle and colour that the fende maketh to withdrawe goodnes is th[is] whan a man or a woman by deuout sterynges of thoughtes haue felynges of contemplacyon and medytacyon as perauenture some solytarye persones hath:  and he maketh them to thynke that to holde & kepe that medytacyons is to theyr moost proufyte to thentent they sholde leue theyr dyuyne\n\n\n\n \n\nseruyce that they be bounde to / and bryngeth them in suche a combraunce that they wote not whyche waye is best to them to take; and all this he dooth vtterly to deceyue them and cause them to be vnquyet to doo ony of theym bothe.  The thyrde crafte or wyle that he tempteth with is whan a man or a woman gyueth them to honest dysporte to strength themselfe ayenst his false wyles to the comforte of theyr owne soule / than wyll the fende cause theym to haue a conscyence therof / and putteth in to theyr myndes that all suche dysportes is but synne and vanyte, And many tymes bryngeth in to theyr myndes agayne the synnes that they before had done and were confessed of; And all that dooth he to brynge them in to heuynes and dyscomforte to thentent he myght brynge theym to dyspayre.  Neuertheles there be good remedyes in these temptacyons. For as vnto the [first] where the fende whan they be neuer so clene shryuen alwaye putteth them in a doubte that they haue not shryuen them well or elles that there is yet some synne in theym that they perceyue not:  but for all these fantasyes they oughte to take noo fere nor thought but verayly thynke that it is by suggestyon of theyr ghostly enemy that wolde lette theym from rest and peas of theyr soules; and though it be so somtyme that by the meane of suche fantasyes and troubles they forgete some thynge of theyr charge whiche they ought for to haue sayd:  lette hym than be confessed yf he may, and yf he may not conuenyently and lyghtly haue his confessour:  than lette hym haue a full wyll and purpose to be confessed as soone as he can possyble, And in the meane tyme crye god mercy and with a contryte herte aske forgyuenes for his synnes / and than trust fully it is forgyuen hym; for a man is not soo redy to aske forgyuenes and mercy:  but our mercyfull lorde of his grete goodnes is moche more redy to forgyue theym.  And as to the seconde temptacyon wherby the fende wolde lette a man from his dyuyne seruyce that he is bounde vnto vtterly temptynge hym to leue it:  than ought he to be the more dylygent deuoutly & reuerently with good aduysement to saye it; & yf it be so he say alone his seruyce he may whan good thoughtes come or that it wyll please god with swetenes or some hye vysytacyon of the holy ghoost to vysyte and touche hym / than shall it be but well done for to stynte of his seruyce & attende to that medytacyon for a tyme, and after to saye forth / soo that his seruyce that he is bounde vnto be not lefte vnsayd or vndone; and in thus doynge it shall be but lytell lettynge to his seruyce / and he shall fynde grete comforte and ease therin; For though it lette hym for the tyme:  it shall well further hym to the quyckenes of his soule an other tyme.  The thyrde temptacyon is this:  whan a man in due tyme gyueth hymselfe to honest company & dysporte for the strength and comforte of his soule / and the fende putteth in his mynde his synnes tofore done and that he synneth in vayne spendynge the tyme; for all suche temptacions gyue ye no charge for it is the ghostly enemy that so tempteth and troubleth you; For neuertheles ye may be sure that all thynge whiche is truly grounded in god pleaseth his goodnes & nothynge offendeth hym.  Wherfore all goddes seruauntes must grounde them fastely in god / and do by the counseyle of holy chyrche / and yf they soo doo they shall neuer be deceyued / and therfore a man that\n\n\n\n \n\nhath ben sore troubled wel done it is to take hym to dysporte in dyspyte of the fende / and put awaye all other fantasyes / and at tyme conuenyent to aske god mercy of his offences and to praye vnto hym for grace. \u00b6 The eyght chapytre. ALso the fende is full besy to meue men & women to tender conscience / and to brynge them in suche erroures and maketh them wene somtyme whan they do euyll they do noo synne, And somtyme that is well done they thynke it synne, and maketh a venyall synne as greuous as a deedly; And somtyme also the fende encombreth them so gretely that what soeuer they do or leue vndone they be so sore bytten in conscyence that they can no whyle togyder haue ony rest in themselfe.  And all this the cruell enemy dooth by the meane of puttynge them in a false drede and blynde conscyence that he bryngeth them to.  But the remedy of these and all other temptacyons is to be gouerned by theyr confessour or some other dyscrete persone / and fully put them to theyr rule as afore is sayd and nothynge folowe theyr owne blynde conscyence; For yf they folowe theyr owne conscyence it were a grete pryde / in that he wolde holde his owne wytte better than the true counseyle of holy chyrche.  For a man that so wyll doo must nedes fall in grete errours and in to the fendes handes.  And yf suche an errour of conscyence made to you by your ghostly enemy make you thynke that other men fele not that ye fele And for that cause they can not gyue you good counseyle or remedye, And therfore ye nedes must folowe youre owne fantasyes:  yet for all this charge not your herte therwith / but put away all suche errours of conscyence as fast as they come to mynde / and let them not tarye ne sinke in your soule.  And yf ony persone wyll saye that they may not ne can not put theym awaye they saye not truly / for who so is in very wyll to doo away ony suche false suggestyon, tofore god it is put awaye though they haue in them neuer soo false demynges / and therfore haue he neuer so many of them ayenst the wyll of his conscyence:  he nedeth not to drede them.  For out of doubte almyghty god wyll comforte hym or he dye / and the lenger tyme that he suffreth suche vexacyon and trouble the more is he thankefull in the syght of god. \u00b6 The nynth chapytre. ALso though the fende put in you ony thought of dyspayre or make you to thynke that in the houre of deth ye shall haue suche euyll thoughtes and greuous sterynges / and that ye than shall be but lost:  yet for all that byleue hym noo thynge / but answere that ye haue fully put your truste in god / and therfore for all his temptacions by the grete powers of almyghty god and merytes of his passyon thynke verayly it shall be to you noo peryll of soule / but tourne to the shame and confusyon of your ghostly enemye.  And yf ony creature man or woman speke to you sharpe or dyscomfortable wordes / take it mekely and pacyently & thynke that perauenture it is done by the temptacyon of the fende to trouble and lette you / or that it is a chastysynge of god for some worde or dede that ye haue done contrarye to his wyll.  For our lorde god dooth lyke a kynde moder; for\n\n\n \n\na louynge moder that is wyse and well taught herselfe she wolde that her chyldren were vertuously and well nortured / and yf she may knowe ony of theym with a defaute she wyll gyue theym a knocke on the heed / and yf the defaute be more she wyll gyue hym a buffet on the cheke / and yf he doo a grete faute she wyll sharpely lasshe hym with a rodde.  And thus dooth god that is our louynge fader from whome all vertue and goodnes cometh.  He whyll that his specyall chosen chyldren be vertuously and well taught in theyr soules / and yf they doo a defaute he wyll knocke them on theyr hedes with some wordes of dyscomforte and dyspleasure / and yf they doo a greter faute he wyll gyue them a buffet with grete sharpenes in sondry maners after the dyuerse condycyon of the defautes / and yf they doo a moche greter trespas than he chastyseth theym moche more sharpely. And all this our blessyd lord doth for the specyall loue he hath vnto vs / for as he sayth hymselfe:  them that he loueth / them he chastyseth.  Now truly, and we toke good hede of these wordes we wolde be gladder of his chastysynge than of all this worldes cherysshynge / and yf we so dyde / all dysease and trouble sholde tourne vs to comforte and Ioye.  But it is full harde thus to doo in the tyme of sharpe heuynes whan a soule standeth naked from all ghoostly and bodely comforte, to take and fynde Ioye in dysease; al be it they that be in suche inwarde dures they must seke in all wayes how they may comforte themselfe in god / and thynke and trust fully that god sente neuer suche chastysynge but that he wolde in longe tyme or in shorte sende comforte wherby they sholde be brought out of these heuynes.  For the prophete sayth many be the trybulacyons of ryghtwysmen / and all suche god shall delyuer.  And though ye fele somtymes sterynges of [dyspayre or of] vnkyndly euyll thoughtes comforte you euer in the goodnes of god / and in the paynefull passyon that his manhode suffredde for you; for the fende tempteth many of the seruauntes of god to dysperacyon and drede of saluacyon / as well worldely men as other ghoostly lyuers / puttynge in worldely mennes myndes the greuousnesse of theyr synnes / and to the ghoostly lyuers he putteth drede & strayte consyence in many more sondry wyses than I can tell:  and full gracyously god hathe comforted theym and brought theym out of theyr errours.  And now I am styred and moued for to tell you of one of them whiche was a squyer that hyght Iohn\u00af Holmes.  A narracyon.  This squyer that I haue named had ben a grete synfull man / and soo at the last thorugh the beholdynge of his grete synnes, And by the temptacyon of the fende, he fell in to dyspayre, soo depely and greuously that he had nygh loste hys mynde.  And thus he was troubled forty dayes that he myght neyther slepe ne ete but wasted awaye and was in the poynte to destroye hymselfe.  But that blessyd gracyous lorde that is soo full of mercy and pyte wolde not haue hym loste.  And vpon a day as he walked in a wood alone an aungell came to hym in fourme of a man and saluted the squyer full goodly / and talked with hym in full curteys maner / sayenge vnto hym:  man thou semest to haue grete heuynes and sorowe / tell me I praye the the cause of thy dysease.  Nay sayd the squyer it is not to be tolde to the.  Yes hardely sayd the aungell / thou wotest not how well I may helpe and remoue thy dysease; For a man beynge in dyscomforte sholde alwaye dyscouer his heuynes to some\n\n\n \n\ncreature that myght ease hym / for thorugh good counseyle he myght recouer comforte and hele / or in some wyse haue remedye.  The squyer answered the aungell agayne and sayd that he wyste well he neyther coude ne myght helpe hym, And therfore he wolde not tell it to hym.  This sayd squyer wenynge alway that this aungell had ben an erthly man / and dredde that yf he had tolde it vnto hym he sholde haue sayd some worde that sholde vtterly haue greued hym more.  And whan the aungell sawe he wolde by no way tell it vnto hym / he sayd vnto the squyer in this wyse:  Now sythe thou wylte not tell me thy greue I shall tell it the.  Thou arte sayd the aungell in dyspayre of thy saluacyon: but trust me faythfully thou shalte be saued / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes / and surmounteth all synnes.  It is sothe sayd the squyer, I wote wel that god is mercyfull, but he is also ryghtfull and his ryghtwysnes must nedes punysshe synne, And therfore I drede his ryghtfull Iugementes.  The aungell spake vnto hym agayne and tolde hym many grete examples how gracyous and mercyfull our lorde god is to synners.  But the squyer of whome we spake was so depely fallen in dyspayre that he coude take no comforte of ony thinge that he coude saye.  Than the aungell spake agayne to hym in this maner:  O sayd he that thou arte harde of byleue! but wylte thou haue an open shewynge that thou shalte be saued?  Than sayd he to \u00fee squyer I haue here thre dyce that I wyll throwe / and thou shalte throwe them also / & who that hath moost of the dyce sykerly shall be saued.  A sayd the squyer how myght I in this throwynge of the dyce be certayne of my saluacyon? / & helde it but a Iape; / that notwithstandynge the aungell threwe the dyce and he had on euery of the dyce vpwarde the nombre of syxe.  And he than bad the squyer throwe the dyce.  O than sayd the squyer certaynly that dare I not doo / for I wote well though I caste / more than thou hast caste sholde I not cast ne haue / and yf I had lesse than sholde I fall in ferther dyscomforte. / But so specyally the aungell desyred and spake that at the last the squyer threwe the dyce / and in throwynge by the gracyous myght and power of god euery dyce deuyded in two / & on euery dyce was the nombre of syxe / and so he had the double that the aungell had.  And as he was meruaylynge therupon the aungell vanysshed out of his syght / wherfore he thought veryly than it was an aungell sente from god to brynge hym out of his sorowe / and than he toke moche comforte and Ioye in the grete mercy & goodnes of god in suche maner that all his dredes and sorowes were clene departed / and he became a vertous man and the very seruaunt of god / and lyued blessydly.  And whan he sholde departe from this worlde he deuysed there sholde be a stone layde vpon hym / with these wordes wryten aboute it that foloweth:  Here lyeth Iohn\u00af holmes that of the mercy of god may saye a larges.  I knowe a worshypfull persone that was in the same abbey here in englonde where as he lyeth, that redde the same wordes afore sayd wryten on his tombe.  Now than sythen our mercyfull lorde god sent thus his gracyous comforte to this man that was a worldly synfull man & receyued hym to grace and brought hym out of dyspayre:  There sholde noo man be dyscomforted nor dyspayre of ony temptacyons / for hardely god wyll\n\n\n \n\ncomforte hym whan he seeth his tyme / and thoughe he sende not a man comforte shortely it shall be to his more mede / & therfore thynke alwaye whan ye thynke of ony temptacyons bodely or ghostly that ye stande in the blessynges of all holy chyrche / for holy wryte sayth: blessyd be they that suffreth temptacyons, For whan they be well proued they shall haue the crowne of lyf the whiche almyghty god hath promysed to them that loue hym. \u00b6 The tenth chapytre. O ye chyldren of holy chyrche that hath forsaken the worlde for the helth of your soules & pryncypally to please god: comforte you in hym whome ye haue chosen to loue and serue / for he wyll be to you full free and large: as ye may se by example of Peter in the gospel where as he asked our lorde Ihesu cryst what rewarde he sholde haue that had forsaken all thynge to folowe hym, And our lorde answered hym and sayd that he sholde Iuge with hym the twelue trybes of kynredes of Israell at the daye of dome; and ferthermore our lorde sayd also vnto him that not onely one or two or some / but he sayd all tho that forsake for his loue kynne / frendes / possessyons / or ony erthly goodes: they shall haue in this lyfe an hondred folde more / and after blesse withouten ende. Therfore syster cast awaye all suche false dredes that wolde trouble and lette you from loue and hope of our mercyfull lorde god / for no thynge pleaseth soo moche the fende as to se the soules withdrawe from the loue of god And therfore he besyeth hymselfe full sore daye and nyght to lette and trouble loue and peas in mannes soule / and on the other syde noo thynge confoundeth nor dyscomforteth hym so moche as whan he seeth a man sette all his desyre to haue the loue of god.  Alas though ye fele not that feruent loue of god / shall ye by your Imagynacyon fall in dyscomforte and heuynes of herte / & thynke yourselfe lost?  Nay / nay / put awaye all suche dyscomfortable heuynes & thynke well it cometh of your enemy the fende / & euer haue a good wyl to loue and please god / and prynte well these wordes in your herte that a good wyll is accepte[d] as for a dede in the syght of god; and comforte you alwaye in the name of Ihesu / for Ihesu is as moche to saye as a sauyour / & therfore thynke well euer therupon / & bere it in your mynde with his passyon / and also his other grete vertues / for nothynge shall so soone put awaye all dredefull temptacyons & fantasyes as the remembraunce of this name Ihesu / his bytter passyon and gloryous vertues. These thre be shelde and spere / armure / & strength to dryue downe the fendes power be he neuer so fyersly set to tempte man or woman; & specyally to thynke on his grete vertues: how god the fader in hymselfe hath all dyuyne nature & in whome is all myght and power and to whome is all thynge possyble and no thynge impossible to hym, And god the sonne is all wysdome that all thynge may make and gouerne / and god the holy ghoost is all loue and bounte that in a moment of tyme all synnes may forgyue.  I saye not to you thre goddes but thre persones and one god / in whome is all blysse and glory.  He is so fayre and bryght shynynge that all the aungelles meruayle of his beaute / his gloryous blessydfull beaute & presence fedeth and fulfylleth all the courte of\n\n\n \n\nheuen with suche myrthe and melody that is euerlastynge.  In hym is all benygnyte kepynge vs from vengeaunce / and in hym is all grace and gentylnes / curtesy / fredome / and largenes / pyte / mercy / and forgyuenes / Ioye / swetenes / and endles helth; our socour he is in all trybulacyons whan we call vpon hym / our comforte / our strength / our helpe / and our soules helth.  Iwys syster this is [y]our spouse / whome ye desyre to loue and please; the gretenes of his vertues ne the multytude of his Ioyes whiche spredeth to all them that be in the courte of heuen noo herte can thynke nor tonge tell / for the blessydness of his presence can neyther be sayd nor wryten.  Ioye ye therfore [in] our lorde cryst Ihesu / for he hath bought you full dere to brynge you to that blysse / and therfore saye to hym:  O holy god in whome is all goodnes / whose pyte and mercy made the to descende from the hygh trone downe in to this wretched worlde the valay of woo and wepynge / and here to take our nature / and in that nature thou suffre[d]st payne and passyon with cruell sharpe deth to brynge our soules to thy kingdome:  Therfore mercyfull lorde forgyue me all my synnes that I haue done / thought / and sayd.  Gloryous trinite sende me clennes of herte / purete of soule / restore me with thy holy vertues / strength me with thy myght / that I alway may withstande the fende and all euyll temptacyons.  O good lorde comforte me with thy holy ghoost and fulfyll me with perfyte grace and charyte: that I may from hens forth lyue vertously And loue the with all my herte / with all my myght and with all my soule / so that I neuer offende the but euer to folowe thy pleasures in wyll / worde / thought and dede; now graunte me this good lorde that arte infynyte / whiche eternally shall endure.  And now good syster yf ye doo thus I hope it shall do you grete ease.  And thoughe ye fynde noo maner of comforte, swetnes nor deuocyon whan ye wolde / be not therfore dyscomforted / but suffre it mekely.  For ryght many there be that stryue with themselfe as thought they wolde haue swete deuocyon by maystry:  And I saye you for trouth so wyll it not be had / but by mekenes moche sooner it may be goten, And that is as thus that a man holde and thynke hymselfe vnworthy to haue ony swetnes or comforte & offre hymselfe lowly to the wyll of god and put his wyll fully to the wyll and mercy of that blessyd lorde; for a man sholde not desyre to haue that swetnes & deuocyon for his owne comforte and pleasaunce: but purely and onely entendynge to please god and to folowe his wyll / and than it suffyseth vnto vs whether we haue it or noo.  Some also weneth that and they haue not suche swetnes & deuocyon that they be out of grace: but certaynly some there be that in themselfe feleth noo swetnes nor deuocyon that be in more grace then the other that feleth it / for they haue many comfortes / and better it were mekenes without felynge than felynge without mekenes.  Therfore syster suffre mekely and pacyently what euer falleth vnto you / & euer haue a good wyll to do that may be moost pleasynge to god / and whan ony dyscomforte cometh by temptacyon or ymagynacyon of your enemy haue the wordes in your mynde that ofte is sayd in this wrytynge before, whiche is that a good wyll shall be accepted for a dede / for and ye desyre to be vertuous and to loue and please god it is accepted as for dede before our lorde god / yf you so folowe\n\n\n \n\nit with your myght and power / as whan reason cometh to you with a desyrefull wyll to lyue and doo well; and yf ye ony tyme fele comforte & swetnes and after fele these temptacyons as ye dyde before / yet be ye not dyscomforted therfore ne thynke therupon, Say not alas it is comen agayne it wyll neuer away from me, And by the meane of your owne ymagynacyon fall agayne in discomforte; doo not soo / but comforte you in god / & be gladde that the fende hath enuy vnto you / for whyle the lyfe is in the body he wyll alwaye trouble and tary the seruauntes of god / he is so fully sette ayenst them with al malyce to dysease and dyscomforte theym in all the dyuerse maners that he can or may.  Saynt Augustyne sayth \u00feat in many maner wayes temptacyons be hadde by the whiche the serpent adder enemye to all mankynde tourmenteth mannes soule.  And saynt Gregorye sayth that there is noo thynge in the worlde [in] whiche we ought to be soo syker of god as whan we haue these tourmentes and troubles.  And yf a man saye that bodely turmentes be medeful and not ghoostly turmentes he sayth not ryght / for doubtles the ghoostly tourmentes be more greuous and paynefull that come ayenst mannes wyll than be bodyly tourmentes / and soo moche more be they medefull / and therfore many men doo dyshonour to god that sayth with full aduysement that the fende in this world may more turment than god may gyue meryte / wherfore truly there is no thynge more medefull, charytable nor more godly than for to strength and comforte the soule that the fende soo troubleth / for who so comforteth them that be dyssolate and in sorowe the lorde of comforte Ihesu cryste our lorde and god wyll comforte them without ende in the blysse of heuen / the whiche lorde thorugh the myght and meryte of his paynefull passyon and precyous blode hath puth downe \u00fee power of \u00fee fendes / & hath graunted to crysten soules the vyctory ouer them to the worscyp of all the hole trynyte / fader / sone / and holy ghoost that lyueth & reyneth with-outen ende.  Amen. \u00b6 Here endeth \u00fee remedy ayenst the troubles of temptacyons.", "4": "Katherine of Rome A translation of Alanus de Rupe's Tractatus mirabilis de ortu atque progressu psalterii Christi et Marie . \u00b6 Here begynneth a deuoute medytacyon in sayenge deuoutly \u00fee psalter of our lady with dyuers ensamples. THe gloryous mayster Iohn\u00af of the mounte in his moryall telleth / whiche also I founde in \u00fee boke of frere Thomas of the temple.  In the tyme \u00feat moost blessyd Domynyck the noble fader and leder moost famouse of \u00fee ordre of prechers / preched throughout the worlde in many regyons and exhorted incessauntly \u00fee people to the laude and prayse of \u00fee blessyd marye vyrgyn vndefyled / & to her angelyke confraternyte:  It fortuned hym to preche at Rome in the audyence of the grete prelates of the worlde, and shewed by fygures and examples this blessyd vyrgyn to be saluted moost specyally by her psalter.  All they meruaylled of thaffluence of his wordes, They were astonyed at the\n\n\n \n\ngrete wonders.  To whome he sayd:  O faythfull and true lordes and other true louers of the fayth: here this synguler holsome sayenge to you all / that ye may veryly knowe those thynges whiche I haue spoken to be true:  Take the psalter of this blessyd vyrgyne / and in sayenge it: call deuoutedly vnto your remembraunce the passyon of cryste:  Thus I shewe vnto you that ye shall haue in experyence the spyryte of god.  Truely soo greate a flamble may not stonde in ony place without makynge hote, Neyther soo grete lyghte without gyuynge lyght / nor soo godly a medycyne without the vertue of makynge hole.  What sholde I saye more? all the people gaue audyence and in maner astonyed: they meruaylled of his godly wordes / [&] many persones not onely of the comyn people but also of grete prelates of the chyrche as reuerende cardynalles and many honourable bysshoppes toke vpon them to saye this psalter of our lady / to thentent they myght gete some grace of almyghty god.  A meruayllous thynge: The cyte beynge in trouble / dyuerse multyplycacyon of prayers was [made] amonges the people in euery state or degree.  For truly thou myght se bothe mornynge / euenynge / and at myddaye men and women euerywhere berynge the psalter of our lady.  Cardynalles whiche be named the pyllers of the worlde and bysshoppes shamed not to bere in theyr handes & at theyr gyrdelles these soo grete tokens of the godhede and of our fayth veryly to be byleued.  Truely by the myracles of our lady shewed by saynt Domynyck they doubted not but in excercysynge of this psalter goddes helpe to be redy at all tymes.  What more? All that dyde assaye this psalter perceyued some knowlege of the pyte of god. And amonges all I shall shewe this wonder or myracle onely folowynge. At Rome was a certayne mysdysposed woman of her body, moost famouse aboue all other lyke dysposed / in beaute / eloquence / apparayle / and worldly gladnes / whiche fortuned gracyously to haue the psalter of our lady by thaduyse of holy saynt Domynyk / whiche she hydde vnder her kyrtell and sayd it many tymes on the daye.  But alas she neuertheles vsed the vnlawfull flesshely pleasure and vnclennes of her body aboue all other / more men resorted to her than to ony other woman of suche vayne dysposycyon.  This woman, named fayre Katheryne for the incomperable beaute of her body, contynued in her mysse-lyuynge / and ones on the day at the leest she dyde vysyte the chyrche sayenge the psalter of our lady / and thus was her medytacyon and thought:  The fyrst fyfty she sayd for the infancye of cryst in the whiche he bare all his passyon to come / and yf it were not at that tyme in execucyon / neuertheles it was in his entent and mynde.  The seconde fyfty she sayd for crystes passyon exhybyte and done ryally lyke as he suffred in his manhode.  The thyrde fyfty she sayd for the passyon of cryste as it was in his godhede / not bycause the godhede as the godhede myght suffre / but bycause this infynyte godhede loued so moche the nature of man / that yf it had ben mortall it sholde haue suffred deth; Therfore bycause the eternall wysdome of god in hymselfe myght not dye for vs / he toke vpon hym our manhode / whiche his wyll was sholde suffre passyon & dye for all mankynde.  And as this fayre Katheryne thus contynued in prayenge / it happened on a season as she wente aboute Rome wandrynge after her olde\n\n\n \n\nmaner / a meruayllous fayre man mette her & sayd:  Heyle Katheryne / why stondest thou here / hast thou noo dwellynge place?  To whome she answered sayenge:  Syr I haue a dwellynge place and euery thynge in it ordered to the best and goodlyest maner.  To whome he sayd:  This nyghte wyll I soupe with the.  She answered:  I graunt with all myne herte / and what so euer thou wylte haue I shall gladly prepare.  Thus goynge hande in hande they came vnto her hous where as were many wenches of lyke dysposycyon.  Souper was prepared and this vnknowen geste sate with fayre Katheryne / the one dranke to the other.  But euery thynge that this straunge geste touched / were it drynke or other thynge lyke / anone turned in to blody colour, with a meruayllous excellent smell & swete sauour.  She meruaylynge sayd to hym:  Syr what arte thou / eyther it is not well with me elles thou arter very meruaylous / for euery thinge that thou touchest is anone made of blody colour.  And he answered sayenge:  Knowest thou not that a crysten man neyther eteth nor drynketh but that is dyed or coloured with the blode of cryste.  Thus this woman was meruayllously abasshed of this straunger / soo moche that she fered for to touche hym.  Notwithstondynge she sayd:  Syr I well perceyue by your countenaunce that ye be a man of grete reuerence:  I beseche you who be ye / and from whens come ye?  To whome he sayd:  Whan we be togyder in thy chaumbre / I shall shewe the all thyn askynges.  And thus lefte in doubte of the mater: she made redy the chaumbre.  This woman Katheryne wente fyrst to bedde / & desyred the straunger to come to bedde to her.  A wonderful thynge and suche one as in maner neuer was herde of ony creature:  Sodeynly this straunger chaunged hymselfe in to the shappe of a lytell chylde / bare vpon his heed a crowne of thorne / vpon his sholder a crosse / and tokens of his passyon with innumerable woundes vpon all his body / and sayd vnto Katheryne:  O Katheryne now leue thy folysshenes.  Beholde / now thou seest the passyon of Cryste veryly as it was in his infancye for the whiche thou sayd the fyrst fyfty of thy psalter.  I shewe vnto the / that from the fyrste houre of my concepcyon vnto my deth I bare contynually this payne in myne herte / whiche for thy sake was soo grete that yf euery lytell pece or stone of grauell in \u00fee see were a chylde and euery one of them had as moche payne as euer suffred al the men in the worlde at theyr deth: yet all they togyder suffre not so grete payne as I suffred for the.  This woman was sore abasshed seynge and herynge this wonder.  And anone agayne he was tourned in to the lykenes of a man, euen after the same fourme whiche he had the tyme of his passyon ryall, And sayde:  Doughter beholde now thou seest how grete paynes I suffered for the / whiche dooth excede all the paynes of helle / for my power of suffrynge is of god and not of man.  And my passyon was so grete that yf it had ben deuyded amonge all creatures of the worlde / they sholde all haue dyed or ben dystroyed.  After this sey[i]nge he chaunged hymselfe in to the clerenes of the sonne / notwithstandynge the tokens of his passyon remaynynge also gloryously/ in all his woundes were sene al and infynyte creatures of the worlde for compassyon of the same / and he sayd vnto her: BEholde / take hede / now thou seest what I suffred in my godhede for thyn helth; syth all thynges be in me and I in euery thynge / in all these I se the / I loue the / & in them all I am redy to suffre eternally the payne for thy soules helth whiche thou seest, for my loue is infynyte (after saynt Dyonyse) and all thynges in me be infynyte as the same Dyonyse sheweth.  Therfore knowe the mekenes of god / and call to mynde the threfolde passyon of cryste / for the whiche thou sayd thryse fyfty Aues / & fyftene Pater nosters, And here after amende thyselfe / that as thou were before the example of all malyce and vnclene lyuynge / soo now from this tyme forwarde [\u00feou] lyue in suche maner that thou may be to all other a myrrour of purete and clennes.  I do not appere to the for thy merytes but onely for an example of penaunce / and bycause thy brethren and systers of myn vndefyled moders fraternyte haue prayed for the / that by thy conuersacyon many sholde be conuerted and be the chyldren of god / lyke as before innumerable were made the chyldren of the deuyll by thy wyckednes. What more?  This vysyon vanysshed awaye.  It was also vnfayned / for the woman afterwarde felte in her handes and fete the sorowe of crystes passyon / and in other partes of her body.  Therfore she rose from synne & toke her to penaunce / and on the morowe after made her confessyon to saynt Domynyk; to whome he enioyned in penaunce to saye the psalter of the blessyd vyrgyn Marye as she was wonte to doo, and to be one of her fraternyte / whyche she had not before in dede but onely in purpose and entent as it is afore sayd; where it is to be noted how moche this sayd fraternyte is worth to them whiche haue it in dede / syth it was soo grete valure to this woman hauynge it but in purpose. [&] whyles that she prayed deuoutely vnto this vyrgyn Marye / the same blessyd lady appered to her with saynt Katheryne, sayenge to her:  Doughter beholde / take hede / thou hast synned moche: therfore thou must suffre grete penaunce; for this cause take in penaunce euery daye thre dyscyplynes or thre correccyons / wherof euery one shall be of .lv. strokes whiche make a penytencyall psalter. She sayd also / it shall not alwaye nede to haue a rodde / but prycke the with thy nayles / or pynche thy flesshe in euery place.  Thou mayst at all tymes doo this penaunce ayenst euery wycked temptacyon and for to obteyne all goodnes / and this is a royall, preuy penaunce and naturall, It may be called the quene of all penaunces.  This woman herde all these wordes and fulfylled them in dede. And as she was thus dayly penytent: vpon a tyme saynt Domynyk auaunced by the power of god sawe in the nyght a wonderfull thynge to all the worlde.  He perceyued that from the hous of this same Katheryne yssued out .lv. flodes from the membres of a lytell chyld / ewhiche flodes descended to hell, in whose comynge the soules, there to be purged, were gretely comforted.  O how grete and Ioyfull noyses made they than: how many blessynge gaue they vnto this sayd Katheryne; veryly the erth sounded agayne to theyr voyces for Ioye.  There were soules delyuered / comforted / made hole & excluded from theyr paynes, by the medytacyon that Katheryne had of crystes passyon in his chyldehode.  She was alwaye aboute to applye it to the comforte of all true crysten soules departed out of this worlde.  O meruaylous thynge:  After this saynt Domynyk sawe a man entre\n\n\n \n\nin to Katheryns chaumbre / & from .v. [woundes] of his body yssewed out .lv. [fountaynes] whiche nourysshed and watred all the chyrche mylytante / and also this present worlde; trees and plantes dyde burgyn / byrdes and fysshes were quyckened / true crysten people were bathed in those flodes.  O how grete swetenes was there and how grete worldly gladnes.  All creatures blessyd this woman Katheryne and prayed for her to almyghty god maker of all thynges. And these two meruaylles were shewed for the fyrst fyfty and the seconde.  And where as this penytent Katheryne began the thyrde fyfty of her psalter, Saynt Domynyk sawe a meruaylous grete gyaunt clerer than the lyght / of whome yssewed out fyue fountaynes / of the fyue fountaynes sprange fyfty flodes whiche neyther descended to therth / nor to hell / but meruayllously ascended togyder vnto heuen, And by them all heuenly paradyse was watred.  Theyr swetenes was so grete that the aungelles and holy sayntes dyde drynke of theym / gyuynge grete thankes to almyghty god.  Whan saynt Domynyck sawe all these meruaylles as Thomas of the temple wryteth: he meruaylled gretly why they sholde be shewed and done in the hous of so grete a synner.  To whome marye the vyrgyn appered and sayd:  O my frende Domynyk why doost thou meruayle in suche causes? Knowest thou not I am a frende to all synners and that the mekenes of god is in me?  It was my wyll to shewe these vysyons to the of this my doughter that thou sholde preche them to the worlde / for this entent that no crysten persone be theyr synnes neuer so grete sholde dyspayre in ony condycyon / but alwaye trust in god and his mercy / and namely they that wyll flee vnder my proteccyon with this woman Katheryne.  The holy vyrgyn and martyr saynt Katheryne socoured her very moche whiche alwaye she loued and serued with some prayer from her yonge aege / for the congruence of the name.  More ouer the blessyd moder of god sayd:  O Domynyk thou haste sene these meruaylles:  Here now and preche that I soo holy and meke shall saye.  Shewe that I haue purchased of my sone to all suche as sayth my psalter and are of my fraternyte / they shall haue the same excellence whiche the sayd Katheryne hath.  & though they can not se it in this worlde, lykewyse as men can not se god / his aungelles / the deuylles / neyther theyr merytes and vertues in this lyfe, Also they can not se the vertue of a precyous stone nor of the sterres: therfore the knowledge of heuenly thynges must be moche ferther from them; Notwithstondynge they shall beholde this excellence after theyr deth.  Therfore Domynyk be of good comforte [&] preche my psalter & my fraternyte / for vnto all suche as hath them I haue purchased not onely to se this excellence / but also to haue it eternally in possessyon.  What sholde I saye more?  Saynt Domynyk gaue thankes to almyghty god for his grete mercy.  And this Katheryne made herselfe a recluse [&] she dystrybuted her goddes to the poore people.  Whiche afterwarde was of so grete holynes that many very holy persones came vnto her bycause of her godly reuelacyons.  To whome appered our lorde Ihesu .C. dayes & fyfty before her departynge out of this lyfe shewynge the tyme of her deth / whiche afterwarde departed out of this lyfe very holy.  Thre holy vyrgyns one named Iohanne / an other Martha / the thyrde Lucya sawe her soule departe from the body bryghter than the sonne /\n\n\n \n\nbytwene the armes of her spouse cryst.  Her sepulture is in the chyrche of saynt Iohn\u00af lateranence.  All crysten people by this take hede of how grete vertue the psalter of our lady is with the remembraunce of crystes passyon / it is alwaye in strength bothe in lyf and at the houre of deth.

But sothely, lorde, I trust on thy goodnes and knowe hit so moche that hit may nat so be and I durst sey as I thynke, for grete lykyng hit ys to the to rewe on the synfulle mane and haue mercy one hyme whene he wolde leue hys syne and amende hyme; for haddest thou [nat] hade grete lykyng the synfulle to amende thorow thy mercy and thy grete pyte, thow woldest nat haue suffred\n\n\n \n\nso harde peynes, [betyn] with scorges that alle thy body was with noo[n] hoolle place, nayled feete and handys to the roode-[tree], alle to-drawe with roopys that the synewes [of] the body brostyne, woundyde in to the herte with a sharpe spere; and suffrede one the crosse an horryble deth; and thus woldest [thow] nat suffre, haddest thou nat hade lykyng one the synfulle mane to haue hade mercy one mankynde.  \u00b6 Therfor, lorde, for the grete loue thow haddest to mankynde, haue mercy, haue mercy apone me; lorde, sythene thou graunted to a legyone of fendys that askede the with thy leue to entre into a drove of swyne to graunt heme here askyng, with better wylle lorde I knowe hit thou wylt graunte to thy pore creature and frende, that thou madest lyke to thy-selfe, that prayer to the of mercy [to] graunte hyme [that] with syghyngis and sorowfulle herte asketh foryeuenesse of hys synnes that he hath doone ayenst thy wylle, and resceue hyme in to thy grace to be oon of thyne.  Lorde, alle the bookis that we redyne in holy chyrche, of thy mercy vs tellyne how thou vs louest, and of thy grete pyte that so redy ys to alle the synfulle that wolde hit aske or seke: \u00b6 Whether thow shalt nat saue me as thou other hast sauyde that her synnes forthynkene? lorde, shulde the condyte of mercy that alle resceyueth and gladeth that soore repenteth heme of her mysdedys, shal(!) become drye oonly for me?  And for the grete hope that in the ys thorough the whyche alle manere of folke bene sauyde: \u00b6 allas why shulde hit peryssh in me? whethere thow wolt be so harde to me, that alle mene prechene so large to alle that nede hathe?  Yeff I haue noone?  Who ys syke yeff I am hoole, who hath nede of [mercy but I? who hath nede of] comforte but I?  And therfor O pater misericordiarum et deus tocius consolacionis, qui consolaris nos in omni tribulacione nostra, \u00b6 O fader of alle mercy and gode of alle comforte, that comforteth vs in alle oure trybulacion: haue mercy one me, and brynge me owte of synne, and comforte me in thys woofulle sykenes, and rewe one me though I haue longe tyme leyne in syne; for in thy grete goodnesse I truste for the wordys that by the prophete ys seyde: In eternum seruabo illi misericordiam, \u00b6 Withoutene ende I shalle kepe mercy to synffulle mane; and therfor, lorde, ayenst thy kynde hit were and thy trewthe, but thou one synfulle hade mercy that forethynketh hys synne and wolle aske mercy.  And I forthynkyng my synne in alle my[n] herte, pray the allemyghty gode for thy endeles mercy haue mercy one me, that thou most swete art.  My gode, my goode lorde, hertyly I be-seche the to my seke soule and synffulle thou sende some comforte and socoure off thy grace, and for thy moche mekenesse be mercyffulle to me that ame thy pore creature, off thy[n] owne makyng.  And thy mercy, lorde, ouerpasseth alle thyng that thow madest, as the prophete seyth, that thow may nat for thy goodnesse forsakene heme that askene thy mercy: Quia misericordia eius super omnia opera eius, \u00b6 For [thy] mercy ys aboue alle thy werkis; and therfor, lorde, welle I wote that thow may nat for thy goodnes and for thy endeles mercy put me fro thy mercy, yeff alle myne synnes be neuer so many ne neuer so grete; for thane thow were nat gode whos mercy and goodnesse passeth alle mennes wyckednes that wolle leue her wyckydnesse and here synne with alle here herte, as the prophete seyth: Cor contritum et humiliatum deus non despicies, \u00b6 The herte [that is] contryte and mekyde, God shalle nat despyse.

Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione, 'LOrd god, graunte us helpe of tribulacion'.  To \u00fee, soule, \u00feat art distroublid and temptid, to \u00fee is purposed \u00feat \u00feou schalt lerne wherof tribulacions seruen, and [not] only \u00feat \u00feou schalt suffre hem paciently, [but] gladlye, and comforte the inwardly of \u00feat \u00feou arte discomforte outwarde.  For Seneca sei\u00fee: Non est ita magna consolacio sicut illa que ex desolacione extrahitur, There is none so gret comforte as is \u00feat \u00feat is drawen oute of discomforte.  Which comforte may noman haue, but he know first the frute of tribulacion, \u00feat is to seye, but he know how god sendith tribulacions and ordeyne\u00fee heme to \u00fee prophet of the soffrers, but if it so be that rebelnesse of frowardnes with-stonde \u00fee ordinaunce of god.

For ryght as mete euel chewed is euel to defye, ryght so techynge of hooly writt neccligently redd or herd profiteth lytell or ellis nou&yogh;te. Of the first prophet of tribulacion. Capitulum primum. The firste prophet of tribulacion is vnderstond \u00feat it is a trew socoure of help sent frome god to delyuer the soule fro \u00fee handis of his enemyes, whiche enemyes ben \u00feese: preuy suggestions of \u00fee fende \u00feat cruel enemy, ffalse ioyes\n\n\n \n\n& richesse of the world \u00feat disseiuable enemy, vnclene lustis of the fflessh \u00feat homly enemy.  Thes enemyes sleen \u00fee soule, and so mych \u00fee more (perl)osly, \u00feat \u00feei disseiuen it with false feyned frendshyp and so preuyly.  The which ben figured bi Ioas, IIo Regum .XX., that feyned hym frend to Amas holdynge hyme by \u00fee chyne as he wold haue kyssed hyme, and so with his swerd in \u00feat oder hond preuyly stiked hyme.  Vpone \u00feis sei\u00fee seint Gregor: Yf euery fortune is for to be drad, moch more is for to be drad prosperite \u00fean aduersite\u2014as schewe\u00fe opynly.  And note wel \u00feat god ordeyneth all \u00feingis in tribulacion to [\u00fee] delyueraunce of his seruauntis, as he behoti\u00fee be \u00fee prophet Dauid, seying \u00feus: Cum ipso sum in tribulacione, eripiam eum & glorificabo eum, I am with hym in tribulacion, I schal delyuer hym of tribulacion, and I schal glorifye hym for tribulacion.  For als much \u00fean as god is with vs in tribulacion, we schal suffre it paciently and gladly, for \u00fee more \u00feat tribulacion groweth to \u00fee, the more nere god nei&yogh;hith to \u00fee, as \u00fee prophet seith: Iuxta est dominus hijs qui tribulato sunt corde, & humiles spiritu saluabit, Oure lord is faste-by to hem \u00feat ben in tribulacion of herte, and he schal saue hem \u00feat ben meke of spirite.  Therfor if the peyne of tribulacion make the heuy and greuyth the, \u00fee my&yogh;t and the mercy of god thy sauioure \u00feat is with the in tribulacion, schall inwardly comfort the.  But now perauenture \u00feou my&yogh;test answere & sey thus: 'The bitter payne ofe tribulacion I fele wel, but swettnesse of his fellowshyp I fele none; ffor if he schewed to me the present swetnesse of hy[s] myrth as he doth the bitternesse of tribulacion, I schuld suffer it gladly'.  Also perauenture thow woldist seye that afore tribulacion thow felist more swetnesse in god \u00fean \u00feou dedist whan \u00feou were in tribulacion.  Here-to may be answered, \u00feat \u00fee frendshipe of god in tribulacion is vnder-stond in twey maners.  First: as tribulacion encresith, so god multiplieth grace & vertu for to suffre tribulacion paciently & gladly.  Example: as lordis send socoure and helpe to comforte hyr seruauntis \u00feat be in castellis besegid of her enemyes, ry&yogh;t so oure lord god sendi\u00fee comfort of grace to soules \u00feat ben be-segid with temptacions & tribulacions.  The secund maner of the fellowschype of god in tribulacion may be vnderstonde by the comforte \u00feat he sendith hem \u00feat bene in tribulacion; as the apostil seithe, I Cor. IIo: Sicut habundant passiones Christi in nobis, ita habundat consolacio nostra, As the passion of Criste encresith in us, so encresith oure comforte.  Cristis passions encresyne in us when thei be sent fro hym and we to [\u00fee] lyknesse of hym mekely & paciently suffer hem as goddis seruauntis, and not as mansleers and thevis, whiche hane deseruid \u00feat \u00feei sufferne.  And vnderstond well, \u00feat comforte of grace in tribulacion is for he schulde dred god and trist in hym to be delyuerde; as we rede in the boke of holy fader seint Anton, how he after many gret spirituall temptacions was troublyd of fendis, bodyly betone and woundid all hys body, so \u00feat whan his seruaunt cam to viset hym he found hyme lying dede & so he toke hym vp and bare hym to the next towne where he watched tyll abow&yogh;t mydny&yogh;t; and \u00fean by the will ofe god he releued and bad his seruaunt preuyly, all other sclepyng, bere hym a&yogh;en; and so he did.  And whan he was brou&yogh;t ayen thedir so feble \u00feat he my&yogh;t not stonde, but sittynge vp he seid \u00feus: 'Where bene ye euill spiritis, wicked feendis? lo I am here be \u00fee my&yogh;t of god redy to withstond all youre malice'.  & after \u00fees and many [othir] wonderfull temptacions: oure lord appered to hym in wonderful ly&yogh;t & comfortable.  To whom hooly Antone seid: 'A lord Ihesu, where hast \u00feou bene? good lord, where hast \u00feou be so longe fro me in tribulacion?'  And oure lord answered and seyd: 'here with the, beholdynge thi fyghtynge, redy to reward the and comforte the after thi uictory, as I am wont to do for my chosin childerne'.  For wit \u00feou well \u00feat comforte oweth not to com, tyl that a place be rayed therto by tribulacion.  Also we rede of Sare, the\n\n\n \n\ndou&yogh;ter of Raguell, Tobie IIIo: Hoc autem certum habet omnis qui colit te quia vita eius si in temptacione fuerit coronabitur, si autem in tribulacione fuerit liberabitur, et si in correpcione fuerit ad misericordiam tuam peruenire licebit.  Non enim delectaris in perdicionibus nostris; quia post tempestatem tranquillum facis, et post lacrimacionem et fletum exultacionem infundis: Euery man \u00feat worschippith the, god, hath this for certeyn that yf his lyfe be here in temptacion, he schalbe crowned, and yf he be in tribulacion he schalbe delyuerd, & [yf] he be in chastisyng it schalbe leffull to com to \u00fei mercy; \u00feou delitest not in oure per[i]chynge, for after tempestis \u00feou makist tranquillite, & after teers and wepyng \u00feou sendist gladnesse. as the prophet seith: Secundum multitudinem dolorum meorum in corde meo consolaciones tue letificauerunt animam meam, After the multitude of the sorrowes in myn herte thi comfortis hane gladdid my soule.  The comforte of on oure passith \u00fee sorrowes of tribulacion of many &yogh;eris; ffor god \u00feat commyth for to helpe & comforte, after tribulacion schal abyd with \u00fee, gladdynge \u00fei soule.  And perauenture yf \u00feou pleineste \u00fee \u00feat \u00feou tarrieste ouer-longe abydynge his comforte, as louers be wont to pleyne: here-to answeri\u00fee a gret clerke, Cassiodorus: Ipsa uelocitas dei desideranti & amanti tarditas videtur, The swiftenesse of god to a desirynge & a louynge soule semyth longe tariynge, [or thus: a thyng \u00feat is moche couetyd semeth grete tariyng] to a louynge soule.  \u00dean of \u00feese tofore-seid may be concluded \u00feat a soule discomforted in tribulacion oweth not to hold hym-selfe ouercom of his enemyes, but rather delyuerde.  Si\u00fee \u00fean \u00feat \u00feis is sothe \u00feat tribulacions delyueren us from oure enemyes, \u00feough so be \u00feat \u00feei be heuy and chargeable yet neuer-the-lesse \u00feei schulden be suffred paciently & gladly, with-out grocchynge a-&yogh;ens tribulacions; for yf we gruche a-yence hem, \u00fean we strive a-yenst oure helpers & we helpen oure enemyes.  And for we be not stronge of oure-silfe to delyuer vs from oure enemyes, pray we to god mekelye seyinge with the prophet: Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione, Lord god graunte us helpe of tribulacion. The secund prophet of tribulacion. Capitulum secundum. The secund prophet of tribulacion is \u00feat it stoppith the malice of the fend; for he is a-ferd to tempt \u00fee soule \u00feat is in tribulacion, for he dredith hym to be ouercome or ellis refused.  & \u00feat is figured by the frendis of Iobe, where it is seyd, Iob. IIo: Nemo loquebatur ei uerbum, videbant enim dolorem eius uehementem, Noman speke to hym a word, \u00feei sigh his sorrowes werne grete.  The feyned frendis of Iobe betokyn wicked feendis \u00feat wexen or troublyn soules, which dare not com ny&yogh;e a soule \u00feat is in tribulacion, ne tempt it beynge distroublyd.  & not oonly tribulacion stoppith the malice of the fende, but also \u00feere-thorou&yogh; the soule deseruith comforte as of angels and of seyntis, as we rede of holy faders many oone.  Of which one commyth to mynde.  Abbot Sisoy after meke sofferrynge of tribulacions & desesis, a litill to-fore the soule schuld passe from the body, he seyd: 'brethern, bene(!) glad, lo holy Anton commyth to us'; & sone after he seyd: 'lo here commyth the worshypful company of prophetis'; and the thrid tyme he seid: 'now commyne the holy apostillis'; and as it semed to hem \u00feat stodyne abou&yogh;t he spake with hem; and \u00feen \u00feei prayeden [hym] \u00feat he schuld tel hem with whom \u00feat he spake, and he answerid and seid: 'with holy angels \u00feat commyn to take my soule; and I prayed hem to byd[e] a while, \u00feat I schuld suffre more pennaunce'; and \u00feese wordis I-seyd, \u00fee spirit passeth with gret ly&yogh;t, all \u00feei felynge a wonderfull swete sauoure.  Note well \u00feat \u00feere is no perell in tribulacion of temptacions so \u00feat \u00feou answere not to hem by dilectacion or consentynge, as \u00fee spech of ane opyne cursed man noyeth not but yf \u00feou answere to hym.  \u00feat is figured in holy wrytt where it is seyd, Ysaie XXXVIo: Mandauerat enim rex E&yogh;echias ne populus responderet blasfemijs Rapsacis, Kynge E&yogh;echie commaunded \u00feat \u00fee peple schuld not answere to the blasfemis of that tiraunt\n\n\n \n\nRapsacis.  By Rapsacis is vnderstond the feend, and by his blasfemyes bene vnderstond temptacions of wicked \u00feou&yogh;tis, which noyeth nou&yogh;t but yf \u00feou wilfully assent to hem.  And if \u00feou fele \u00fee feble by frelet[e] of the flessh, pray \u00feou god besily in tribulacion \u00feat he stop the malicious temptacion of the fend, as the prophet seith: Lord god graunt us helpe of tribulacion. Of the thrid prophet of tribulacion. Capitulum tercium. The thrid prophet of tribulacion is \u00feat it purgi\u00fee the soule.  But it is to wit \u00feat ther bene v. maner of materiall purgyngis.  On is purgynge of mannys body for corrupcion of humoris wicked; & \u00feat is in two maners: one ys be medicinable drynkys, a nother be crafty blood-lettynge.  The secund purgynge ys of metal, as gold be \u00fee fire, & iron be the fyle.  The thrid purgynge is of trees, as cuttynge of vynes, and voydynge of onfrutfull branches.  The fourth purgynge is of corne, as betyng or thresshyng with a flayle.  The fyfte purgynge is of grapis, & that is by a pressoure.  One \u00feus many maners god doth purge the soule by tribulacions.  For as the body is purged by medicinalle drinkis of euell humoris, ryght so is the soule made clene by tribulacions sent from the souereyne leche oure lord god of veyne affeccions and euell maners; for seynt Gregor seyth: Mali humores sunt mali mores, Euel humoris bene euel maners.  Drinke \u00feis medicyne of tribulacion sent to the fro god, for he is a wise leche and knoweth all \u00fei preuy syknesse & how much \u00feou maist suffre and how much \u00feou nediste, for he sendi\u00fee the no thynge but \u00feat \u00feat is profitable to the.  And he ha\u00fee tasted and assayed and drunke afore the, not for hym-selfe but for \u00fei purgynge, he suffred \u00fee passione of deth; wherof he seyd to the apostellis Iohn\u00af and Iamys, Mat. xxo: Potestis bibere calicem quem ego bibiturus sum, Mow ye drynke \u00fee passione \u00feat I schal drynke?  \u00dean sith this wise lech hath dronke this medicyn for \u00fei loue, drynke \u00feou therof with-oute drede, for it is holsom.  This drynke thirsted the prophet Dauid whene he seid: Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen domini inuocabo, I schal take the holsome passione of tribulacion.  And if \u00fee \u00feinke it bitter, clepe \u00fei lord god vnto \u00fei helpe as he seid: Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione, Lord god graunt us helpe of tribulacion.  And as a purgacion schuld be receyued hastyly with-oute ouer-much tastynge or longe tarryng, so schuld tribulacion be acceptid wilfullye with-out argumentis of disputynge or rebellyone or grucchynge.  But now be wel ware: for as some-tyme \u00fee prophet of the medicyne is letti[d] and worchith the contrary to corrupcion, not for the defaute of \u00fee medcyne, but for \u00fee euel disposicion of hym \u00feat receyueth hit, so in the same wise the prophet of tribulacion is lettid of purgacion and doth the contrary, for it is begynnynge of payne, after which foloweth euerlastynge dampnacion; as we reden of kyng Pharo kynge of Egipt, for the more \u00feat he was visettid by tribulacion, the more his rebellious herte encresyd in to his dampnacion.  The secund purgacion of mannys body for euel humoris is by crafty blood-lettynge, and that is of two maners, as by openynge [of \u00fee veyne, or els by boxynge or ventusynge.  Openynge of the veyne] is properyd to confession, and boxynge or ventusyng, to tribulacion.  And not[e] wele, ryght as foule blode corruptith the body, so syn which is called in holy writ 'blood' defouleth the soule.  The veyne be the which blod or syne ys voidid oute, is the mouth, as it is seyd Prouerb. x: Vena vite os iusti; quia iustus in principio accusator est sui, The mouth of a ry&yogh;tful man is the veyne of lijf; for the ryghfull man in the begynnynge accuseth hym-selfe, \u00feat is to sey, be confession.  Also note that as a man oweth by this veyne to voyde oute wicked blood for the purgynge of his body, and kepe his good blood for his norisshynge, ryght so in confession he oweth by his mouthe to shew all his synnes, and with-hold and kepe preue all his good dedis for fere of lesynge; for good [dedis] schewed in\n\n\n \n\nconfession by veyneglory or avauntynge, turnyn fro vertu vnto vicis for defaute of wise kepyng, as we redyne of the pharase that seyd, Luc.  XVIIIo: Gracias ago tibi domine quia non sum sicut ceteri hominum, raptores, adulteri, uelut eciam hic publicanus; Ieiuno bis in sabbato, decimas do omnium que possideo: Lord I \u00feanke \u00fee for I am not lyke as other men, robbers and auoutrers, also not lyke this publycan; I fast twise in a weke, I paye tythes of all \u00feat I haue.  Lo here \u00feou maist vnderstond by this pharase a false feyned and a prowd confession. Sed publicanus a longe stans noluit oculos ad celum leuare, sed percuciebat pectus [suum] dicens Deus propicius esto michi peccatori: But the publican stondynge a-ferre behynde, holdynge hym-selfe vnworthi, wold not lyfte up his &yogh;ien to heuen, but he smote his herte and seyde God haue merci on me synner; and so this publican yode thens iustified, or made ryght, by his verry meke confessione.  To this acordith the prophet Dauid where he seith thus: Dixi confitebor aduersum me iniusticiam meam domino, & tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei: I schall knowlege [by] meke confession ayence my-silfe to my lord myn vnry&yogh;twisnes, and \u00feou haste for&yogh;euen the wickidnesse of my synne.  \u00b6 Boxynge or ventusyng, a-cordyth to tribulacion; for als many desesis as god sendith to the in tribulacion, so many remedies he ordeynith for thi purgacion.  But note wel as it is nedeful afore ventusynge, the flessh to be het and clensid, for \u00fean the smytynge of the blood-yryne may be suffred the more esily; so it is spedful afore tribulacion \u00feat the hert be hett with parfite loue and charite, \u00feat temptacion of tribulacion may be suffred the more paciently and gladly.  In figure here-of the holygoste cam downe to the apostilys in lyknesse of fire, bi whome thei were so strengthid and comforted \u00feat afterward \u00feei werene gladd and yedyn Ioyinge for \u00feei were maade worthi to suffer tribulacion, angre and repreue for the name of Ihesu, the which afore \u00feat tyme were so dredful \u00feat \u00feei fleddyn aweye fro hym and som forsokun [hym], as Petir\u2014\u00feat was prince of the apostilles\u2014for fere of a woman swore \u00feat he knew hym not, the which after [\u00fee] commynge of the holygoste dred not the cruell turment of Nero the emperour, but paciently and gladly suffred to be crucified and dede.  The secund maner of materyall purgacion is of metallis, as gold be fyre, and irone by file.  For ryght as fire departith gold from other metallis, and purgith hym of ruste and fylth, and maki\u00fee hire faire and clene: so tribulacion departith the soule of his aduersaries, and clensith hym of the filth of synnes, and it makith hym to god lovely and acceptable; and therfor it is seyd Sapienc.  Vo: Tamquam aurum in fornace probauit electos dominus, et quasi holocausta hostii accepit illos, & in tempore erit respectus illorum, Oure lord hath preued his chosen men by tribulacion as gold is preued in the fornaise, and he hath accepted hem as sacrifice of offrynge, & in tyme of reward \u00feat schuld be hold(!).  With this fire of tribulacion was Iob preved when he seyd, Iobe XXIIIo: Probauit me deus sicut aurum quod per ignem transit, God preuith\u2014by tribulacion\u2014me as gold \u00feat passith by fire.  And note \u00feat amonge all metallis gold is moste preciouse, and leed is leste of price, & yet neuertheles gold is not purged with-oute leed, for leed draweth with hym in the forneis the filthes of gold.  On the same maner chosine soules [the whiche be likned to gold], bene purged by dampned soules the which be likened to leed; wherof Salomon seith: Stultus seruiet sapienti, The fole schal serue to the wise man\u2014\u00feat is to seye, euell men schal serue to purge good men by tribulacion.  \u00b6 Also Iron is purged bi the file of ruste, and made schynyng and bry&yogh;t: so is the soule purged by tribulacion from vnclennesse & comforted with gostly ly&yogh;t.  And as a knyfe \u00feat is not vsed, abydynge in the sheth draweth ruste: so doth the soule with-oute excersise of tribulacion, desireth vnclene luste; as we redyne of Dauid, IIo Reg. IIo, [\u00feat] whan he was with-owt tribulacion of werrynge with his enemyes, fell into auoutrye with the wife of Vry \u00feat wor\u00fei kny&yogh;t, & after into homicide or manslau&yogh;ter.  \u00deerfor sei\u00fee \u00fee prophet Ieremye: Fertilis erat Moab in diebus adolescencie sue, & requieuit in [fecibus] suis: Moab, \u00fee which is vnderstonde the son of my people, was plenteuous by grace in tyme of his tribulacion, and he hath rested in filthes of syn.  Than gruche not ayence god whan he filyth thi soule to make it faire and clene, louely and ly&yogh;t, or els may it neuer com to haue of hym that blissed sy&yogh;t whereof it is seide Mat. V o : Beati mundo corde quoniam ipsi deum videbunt, Blessed bene \u00feei \u00feat bene clene of hert for \u00feei schull se god.  \u00b6 The thrid maner of purgynge \u00feat accordyth to tribulacion, is of trees, as cuttynge of vinis, or wedyng of vnfrutefull braunchis; wherof Crist seith, Iohn. XX o : Omnem palmitem in me non ferentem fructum, tollet eum, & omnem qui fert fructum, purgabit eum, ut fructum plus afferat, Euery vyne-braunche \u00feat bringeth forth no frute in me \u00feat am a warre vyne, my fader, \u00feat is a tilier, schal kut hym of and cast hym a-weye, and \u00feat braunche \u00feat beryth frute he schall purge hym, \u00feat he may bringe forth more frute.  By this vyne may be vnderstonde mannys herte, bi tho humoris is vnderstond affeccion or loue, and by vnfrutfull braunchis bene vnderstond flesshly lustis, vnordinate loue of creaturis, carnall affeccions of kynred, and worldly richesse.  When \u00fee humoris of a vyne or of a tree is spred aboute vnto ou\u00feer many vnfrutefull braunchesse, hit bringeth for\u00fee the lasse frute or ellis none; \u00feerfor it longith to a wise tilier or to a good gardiner to cut of \u00fees vnfruteful braunches, \u00feat the vyne or the tree may brynge forth the better frute and the more.  Right so almy&yogh;ti god, which is a wise tilier & a souereyne gardiner, cutti\u00fee a-wey vnclene lustis of \u00fee flessh with the knyfe of bodyly siknesse, he cutte\u00fee a-wey vnordinate loue of creatures with the hoke of aduersite & tribulacions, he cuttith a-wey carnall affeccions of kynred with \u00fee swerd of de\u00fee, & he cutti\u00fee a-wey worldly riches with is irone rodde, as with brennynge of fyre, drenchynge of water, robbyng of theves and such other.  On all these maners doth god chastice and purge by tribulacion, ffor he wold \u00feat the loue of thine herte schuld abyde with hym & bringe forth plenty of spiritual frute in hym, & not abyde ne trust in such deseyuable frendshyp; for seynt Gregory seith: Qui autem labenti adheret, necesse est ut cum labente labatur, He \u00feat lene\u00fee to a fallynge \u00feinge, nedis with \u00feat fallynge he most fall. The foureth maner of materiall purgynge \u00feat acordi\u00fee to tribulacion, is of corne, as by betynge or thresshynge with a flayle, to departe \u00fee corne fro \u00fee chaffe; wherof seith seint Austene: Quod flagellum grano, quod fornax auro, quod lima ferro, hoc facit tribulacio viro iusto, As the fleile seruith to corne, as the fornais seruith to gold, & as the fyle serui\u00fee to yren, so seruith tribulacion to \u00fee ry&yogh;tful man.  As we rede \u00feat the angel Raphael seid to Tobye, Tobie XII o : Et quia acceptus eras deo, necesse fuit ut temptacio probaret te, And for \u00feou were acceptable to god it was nedfull \u00feat tribulacion schuld preue the.  For as betyng of a flaile constreyneth the corne to departe fro the chaffe, so tribulacion constreyneth the herte to forsake the disseiuable loue of the world and the false frendship of synners, which ar vnderstond in chafe.  The prophet of this flayle knew \u00fee prophet when he seid: Ecce ego in flagella paratus sum, Lo I am redy to suffer the betynge of tribulacion.  And therfor seith seynt Austin: Noli conquerere(!) de flagello tribulacionis, si vis habere purum granum, & reponi cupis in celo vbi non nisi purum granum reponetur, Pleyne \u00fee not of \u00fee fleyle of tribulacion, if \u00feou wilt haue clene corne of concience, & if \u00feou wilt coueit to be in \u00fee garner of \u00fee blisse of heuen into \u00fee which \u00feou maist not com till \u00feou be clene purgid.  Be well ware: for as corne \u00feat is grene & moiste, & not ripe ne drye, is not departed from the chaffe with betynge ofe the flaile, but rather cleuith therto, so it is for to dred \u00feat hertis which arne grene in begynnyng of conuersion and moiste in carnall affeccions, which hane not assaid \u00fee profet of tribulacion, be not departed from \u00fee fals frendship of hir enemyes, but rather cleuen to hem as \u00feou&yogh; \u00feei wold be comforted by hem; ffor when god sendi\u00fee us visitacions for to purge \u00fee soule \u00feat he louyth, be it be bodyly siknesse or by losse of godes \u00feat ben temporall or aduersite of enemyes or eny other temptacion\n\n\n \n\nor heuynesse, anon \u00fee herte rennyth all abou&yogh;te to seke comforte of his fals frendis, & it hath grete dred \u00feere as is no nede, as \u00fee prophet sei\u00fee: Ibi ceciderunt timore vbi non erat timor, Thei fellyne doun for dred \u00feere as no dred was.  Hit may be clepid a cursed comforte \u00feat is sett ra\u00feer in a creature \u00fean in god, ffor \u00fee prophet Ieremie seith, Ieremie XIIII o : Maledictus homo qui confidit in homine, & ponit carnem brachium suum, & a deo recedit cor eius, Cursed be \u00feat man \u00feat tristith in man, & he \u00feat settith any creature to be his strength, & he \u00feat departi\u00fee his herte from god.  But it may be clepid a blessid comforte \u00feat is sett in god, as \u00fee same prophet seith: Benedictus uir qui confidit in domino, & erit dominus fiducia eius, Blessed be \u00feat man \u00feat tristeth in oure lord god, & oure lord schalbe his trust.  And \u00feat we schul haue ful trust oonly in god in all maner of tribulacion, & dred fals comforte & euel concell of oure enemyes, we hane ensample of Ochosias \u00fee kynge \u00feat sent messangers to Belsabub \u00fee feend of Acharon to haue comforte & councell where he schuld escape \u00fee tribulacion of siknesse or no; & god sent an angel to Hely \u00fee prophet & bad hym sey to Ochosi: 'For \u00feou hast sent messengers to aske councell of Belsebub \u00fee feend of Acharon, as \u00feou&yogh; \u00feer were no god in Israel of whom \u00feou my&yogh;teste asken councell & comforte, \u00feerfor \u00feou schalt not go oute of \u00fei bed \u00feat \u00feou yedist vpon, but \u00feou schalt dye \u00feerin'.  Also that we schuld not loue \u00fee world ne truste worldlye \u00feingis, seint Iohn biddith, Io Ioh. II o : Nolite diligere mundum neque ea que in mundo sunt, Will ye not loue \u00fee worlde ne worldly \u00feingis. The fifte maner of materiall purgacion is as of grapis, and that is by a pressoure.  For as a pressoure pressith the grapis to departe the preciouse liquore of wyne fro draffe & drastis, so god purgith \u00fee soule \u00feat he loue\u00fee in the pressour of tribulacion fro corrupcion & wickednesse of syn, som-tyme by bodyly seknesse or preuy gostly heuynes, & some-tyme be losse of temporall goodis or persecucion or slaunder of euell men and enemyes, some-tyme for lackynge of noble kynred or by the deth of feythfull frendis; and \u00feerfor suffre paciently the prophet of \u00feis pressoure, yf \u00feou wilt be brou&yogh;t into Cristis blessed seller, of which is seyd Cant. II o : Introduxit me dominus in cellam suam vinariam, The lord \u00fee kyng hath brou&yogh;t me in to his wyne-seller.  Herto accordith seint Austen & seith \u00feat holy martires were so pressid be tribulacion in \u00feis present lyfe, \u00feat \u00fee bodyly mater lefte in the pressoure of \u00feis erth, but \u00fee precious soules were resseyued vnto the seller of euerlastyng blesse.  Gruch not \u00fean ayence god if he haue put \u00fee in his pressoure of tribulacion; for he hath asayed it afore the, as Ysaie the prophet seith in the person of Crist, Ysaie lXIII o : Torcular calcaui solus & de gentibus non est uir mecum, I alone haue tred \u00fee pressoure of tribulacion & no man is with me of folkis.  And \u00feat he seith, not 'no woman', for \u00feat blessed woman moder & maide oure lady seynt Mary abode with hym in full feith when all \u00feo apostilles fled from hym, & was redy to suffre deth by compassyon of hyr son, as \u00fee prophet Symeon seith, Luc. II o : Et tuam ipsius animam pertransibit gladius, The swerd of deth schall passe thorow thyne owen soule.  Now \u00fean sith \u00feis is soth \u00feat oure lord Ihesu Crist hath seyd \u00feis pressoure of tribulacion and that blessed lady his moder mayd Marye, what so euer \u00feou be \u00feat feliste \u00fee in \u00feis pressoure of tribulacion, take it mekely & gladly, praying with \u00fee prophet Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione, Lord graunte us helpe of tribulacion. Of \u00fee IIIIth prophet of tribulacion. Capitulum quartum. The IIIIth profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it ly&yogh;tneth \u00fee to haue \u00fee knowynge of god, in which is perfeccion & \u00fee profet of mannys knowynge; \u00fee which seynte Austyn desired seing in the boke of answers to hym-selfe\u2014 libro soly-loquiorum \u2014 thus: 'Wold god I schuld know \u00fee, lord, wold god I schuld know the!'  And also it is writtun in \u00fee boke of Wisdom, Cap. XV: Nosce te iusticia est consummata, To know \u00fee, lord god, it is fulfilled ri&yogh;twisnes endid.  To this knowynge helpith tribulacion; ffor as the rod constreyneth a child to bowe doun his heed & take heed of his boke & record his lesson, so tribulacion meketh \u00fee herte & makith hym to be-hold his owene freelte & to know god.  Wherfor seith seint Bernard: Deus se facit cognosci verberando, qui oblitus & incognitus erat parcendo, God makith hym-selfe to be knowen in betynge with tribulacion, which was for-yete & vnknowe in his mercyfull sparyng.  Daniel IIII o , of this we hane ensample of the kynge Nabugodonosor, which for prid was cast oute of his kyngdom & leued with wild bestis & ete hey as an oxe, but when he lifte up his y&yogh;e to his maker of hole herte, his witt was restored to hyme a&yogh;en & he knew god \u00feat chastised hym in tribulacion; as is the maner of children, when \u00feei felen scharpe strokis of the rod, \u00feei lifte up her yen to hym \u00feat smytten(!) hem, for \u00feei wolden \u00feat he schuld turne his face to hem by pite & compassione.  Now \u00fean, \u00feou lowly soule \u00feat arte vnder \u00fee rod of tribulacion, considre & know wele \u00feat \u00fee maner of louers is for to send yeftis, tokens and prevy letters ecch of hem to other, for to kepe loue & mynde of knowynge eche to o\u00feer; on \u00fee same maner oure lord Ihesu Crist, as a trew louer, sendith to his beloued children such siknesse as he toke here for hem.  For here he toke mankynde [in] which he suffred many tribulacions, detraccions, blasphemies, scornes, repreues, sclaundris, hungir, thrist, & cold, & many betyngis, scharpe scourgyngis, gret strokis, many thousand of depe woundis, & was nayled vpon the crosse be-twene \u00fee thevis, & died \u00fee schamfullest deth \u00feat the Iues cowde ordeyne for hym; and after \u00feat he was resen fro deth & yed vp vnto heuen, he kept his woundis as for tokynnes, \u00feat \u00feou schuldest know wel \u00feat he wold haue mynde of \u00fee, as he seith by the prophet Ysaie, Ysaie XlIX: Numquid obliuisci potest mulier infantem suum ut non miseriatur filio vteri [sui]?  Et si illa oblita fuerit, ego tamen non obliuiscar tui.  Ecce in manibus meis discripsi te: Whether a woman may foryete her child, \u00feat sho haue no mercy of the sone of hir owen body?  and \u00feou&yogh;e sche foryete her child, I schal neuer foryete \u00fee; lo I haue writtyn the in my handis,\u2014\u00feat is, in all my woundis whiche I suffred for love of the.  Sithen it is so \u00feat he kepith \u00fee shewynge of his woundis as for a tokyn of love to haue mynde on the, why shuldist \u00feou not be glad when he sendith to the such tokyns of loue as he toke here for the, for he wold \u00feou schuldist haue mynde on hyme & know hym?  for he is thi frende & wil not for-yete the.  For als many dyuerse tribulacions as he sendith the, so many sondre messengers \u00feou hast, clepyng \u00fee & warnynge \u00fee to haue mynde on hym.  But now perauenture \u00feou wilte sey \u00feat such tribulacions ar not most necessary to clepe \u00fee to haue mynde of hym, but rather his gracious benefices of profet, for seynt Austyn seith: Dei beneficia nil aliud sunt nisi moniciones veniendi ad eum, The beneficis of god bene no\u00feinge ellis but warnyng or clepyng to com to hym.  To this may be answerid: All-\u00feou&yogh; \u00fee gracious benefettis of god & yeftis of profet, riches, bewte & bounte, clepyn the to haue mynde on hym, yet neuerthelesse inordinate loue is so cleuynge to such yeftis, \u00feat it draweth \u00feine herte rather to haue mynde on the yeftis \u00fean on \u00fee yeuer; wherfor he pleyneth to \u00fee prophet seying: Expandi manus meas & non erat qui respiceret, I haue spred oute my handis, \u00feat is, yeuyng benefettis, & \u00feere was no man \u00feat wold [behold.  He seid not that ther was no man that] wold take hem Quia omnes diligunt munera, sequntur retribuciones, For all men loue yeftis & \u00feei pursuen after rewardis, fro \u00fee most to \u00fee leste; But ther bene few or ellis none \u00feat beholdyn, mekely knowynge the &yogh;euer of hem.  Also perauenture \u00feou woldist sey: all-\u00feou&yogh; it be accordynge to god to clepe indurat & rebellyng hertis to know hym by tribulacion, neuer-the-lesse it nedith note so to god and meke hertis, the which desiren to know hyme by benefettis & yeftis.  To\n\n\n \n\nthis may be answeryd: All-\u00feou&yogh; good meke hertis by naturall delytynge in benefettis knowyn \u00fee yeuer of hem, yit neuerthelesse to \u00fee profet [of] parfite knowynge of god mow \u00feei not com without provynge of tribulacion.  Example here-of we redyn \u00feat Salomon was clepyd by benefettis & yeftis, Iobe was called by drawynge awey of his temporall goodis & sendyng hym tribulacions & aduersitees.  But \u00fees tribulacions brou&yogh;t Iobe to \u00fee parfite knowynge of god; Salomone be prosperite fill vnto folye, lesyng \u00fee profet of \u00fee parfite knowyng of god.  Yf Salomon, \u00feat was so wise, lost \u00fee profet of \u00fee parfite knowynge of god: what-so-euer \u00feou arte trist not \u00feat \u00feou my&yogh;teste longe abyd in \u00feis knowynge [in] such prosperite.  & \u00feerfor suffer paciently tribulacions & aduersitees: & if \u00feou be discomforted \u00feat \u00feei be many & grete, be \u00feou comforted, for \u00fee more & gretter \u00feat \u00feei ben \u00fee more profet of knowynge of god \u00feei brynge to \u00fee.  & if \u00feou can not yett fele any comforte for frowardnesse or freelte of \u00fei-silfe, pray to god \u00feat he comforte the in tribulacion & graunt \u00fee grace to com to \u00fee profet of parfite knowynge of hym, & sey Da nobis domine &c., Lord graunte us helpe of tribulacion. The fyfte profet of tribulacione. Capitulum quintum. The fyfte profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it reuokith or bringeth \u00fee to \u00fee knowynge of \u00fei-selfe.  For \u00feat hert \u00feat hath not put a-wey fer from hym worldly veynglory, may not trewly fele ne know hym-selfe, for \u00feat hert ha\u00fee not verry knowynge of li&yogh;t; wherof \u00fee prophet Dauid seith: Lumen oculorum meorum, & ipsum non est mecum, Ly&yogh;t of knowynge \u00feere is of myn yen, but \u00feat ly&yogh;t is not with me.  [Wo] vnto hem \u00feat dispendyn hyr ly&yogh;t of her knowynge in veyne ioies & worldly \u00feingis, & no\u00feing kepyn to knowen hem-selfe, \u00feat ben not with hym-selfe; for \u00fee more \u00feat \u00fee soule loueth & desireth vayne ioyes & worldly prosperitees, \u00fee more ferther he draweth fro knowynge of hym-selfe.  & \u00feerfor seith seint Gregor: As he \u00feat is be-seged with enemyes dar not go fer oute but he is constreined to turne a&yogh;en for dred, so tribulacions constreynen \u00fee hert to turne into hym-selfe, & \u00fee mo aduersitees \u00feat ben aboute hym, \u00fee fewer he hathe of rennyngis-oute fro hym-selfe.  Than it is a blessed aduersite \u00feat bringith \u00fee to \u00fei-selfe & makith \u00fee, \u00feat \u00feou hast mysgo, to turne a-yene.  Wherof it is seid Exodi XII o : Maneat vnusquisque apud semetipsum, Dwell ech man with hym-selfe\u2014\u00feat is, know hym-silfe, take he kepe to hym-selfe, abyd he with hym-silfe; for as an howse in which noman dwellith, is wasted & fallyth to nou&yogh;t, ry&yogh;t so \u00fee herte \u00feat dwelli\u00fee or abydith not with hym-selfe.  Wo to \u00feat herte \u00feat renneth from hym-silfe all abow&yogh;t like as doth a iaper or a iogiller vnto o\u00feer mennys howsis, for \u00fee more he syngith & iapith & ioie\u00fee in o\u00feer mennys placis, \u00fee more cause he fyndis in his owene place of sorrow & of wepynge; so the more \u00feat \u00fee herte delyteth hym owtward in vayne \u00feinkingis & worldly ioyes, \u00fee lasse he fyndeth in hym-selfe wherof he schuld be comforted.  Therfor tribulacion is well necessary to \u00fee herte to make hym turne vnto hym-selfe, & it constreineth hym to seye with the prophet: Conuerte, anima mea, in requiem tuam, Torne a-yen \u00feou my soule vnto \u00fei reste.  & also oure lord god, hauynge pyte of \u00feat soule \u00feat hath for-wrappid hym-selfe with worldly \u00feingis, seith thus: Reuertere reuertere, sunamitis, reuertere reuertere, ut intueamur te, Turne a&yogh;ene, turne a&yogh;en \u00feou wrecchid caitiffe soule, turne a&yogh;ene turne a&yogh;ene, \u00feat we may be-hold \u00fee; \u00feat \u00feou behold \u00fei-selfe with \u00fee eye of concience, & \u00feat I mowe be-hold \u00fee with \u00fee eye of mercye.  O \u00feou soule \u00feat arte distroublyd in aduersitees, suffer \u00fee to be reuoked to knowynge of \u00fei-selfe by tribulacion; and namly for \u00feat tribulacion byndeth or knytteth to \u00fee \u00fei maker, whom wicked & large\n\n\n \n\nfredom of \u00fee world hathe lettun rynne longe louce fro \u00fei-selfe.  Wherof spekith \u00fee prophet \u00feus: In funiculis Adam traham eos & in uinculis caritatis, I schal drawe hame in \u00fee smale cordis of Adam & in \u00fee bondis of charite.  \u00deese smale cordis of Adam oure fore-fader, which longyn to us as by weye of heritage, ar clepid all maner of pouertees sent from god to refreyne \u00fee hert frome veyne & worldly comfortes; by which god draweth many one as it semeth by vyolence.  Wherof seith seynt Bernard: Trahimur, quando tribulacionibus excercemur, We bene drawe, when we ben haunted with tribulacion.  \u00deerfor \u00feou \u00feat art streyned with \u00fees cordis & bondis of charite, suppose not \u00feat \u00feou arte defouled or forsakyne, but ra\u00feer maad fayre & chosyn of god, all-\u00feou&yogh; \u00feou haue not all \u00feat \u00feou askist; ne trow not hem \u00feat be not streyned with \u00feese bondis to be in verry liberte, \u00feou&yogh; \u00feei han \u00feat \u00feei asken; for like as \u00fee lech whan he graunteth to \u00fee sike all \u00feat he desireth, it is a certeyne signe of deth, ry&yogh;t so the false fredom of this world is a certeyne signe of p[e]rechinge.  For \u00fee more frely \u00feai desyre & fulfillen her owen desire with-oute tribulacion, the rather \u00feei fall down vnto hir dampnacion.  Therfor \u00feou sely soule \u00feat art troublyd, yf \u00feou wilte haue god to \u00fee merciable, suffre \u00fee to be restreyned with \u00fees bondis of tribulacion, which come from god.  Wherof oure lord seyd to \u00fee prophet E&yogh;echiel: Ecce dedi uincula mea super te, Lo I haue &yogh;eue my bondis vpon the.  Be \u00feis is vnderstond \u00feat bondys of tribulacion bene yeftis of god, & \u00fee more tribulacion is, \u00fee strenge hyt byndeth thy soule to god. Also \u00fee prophet of tribulacion is \u00feat it spedith the wey to god; ffor als many tribulacions as \u00feou hast, so many messengers god hath sent to the \u00feat \u00feou schuld haste to hym & not lett be the weye.  Whereof seith the prophet: Multiplicate sunt infirmitates eorum & postea accelerauerunt, Hir seknesse were multiplied & afterward \u00feei hasted hem to god.  Hereof seynt Gregor seith: Disesis \u00feat oppressen vs, to haste to god compellene us.  Suppose \u00feou not \u00fee benefette of tribulacion to be disese; for it delyueryth \u00fee from a greuouse presone & hastith \u00fei weye to the kyngdom of heuene, as it is seid Ecc i . 4 o : De carcere cathenisque interdum quis introducitur ad regnum, From preson & from yron bondis o\u00feer-while a man is brou&yogh;t into a kyngdom.  \u00deis preson is called all \u00feat \u00fee herte loueth inordinatly in \u00feis world; \u00feese irone bondis arne such \u00feingis \u00feat wicked affeccions bene boundyn too.  Oute of \u00feis presone god delyueryth many oone by tribulacion, as when he putteth a-weye from hem such \u00feingis as \u00feei loue inordinatly; and \u00feat is fygured be seint Peter \u00feat was kept in Heroudis presone, whane oure lordis angel stode be-syde hym, on Petris syd smote, he excited hym and seyd: 'ryse vp swyth', & anone the yron bondis fellen from hys hondis.  Be the syde of Petir is vnderstond \u00fei brother, \u00feat cam owte of \u00feat same syde \u00feat \u00feou cam of, or ellys generally all \u00feo \u00feat arne alyed to \u00fee by kynred or by affynite.  For when enye of these or all which be lawe of nature ou&yogh;t to be \u00fei frendis, is contrarious to \u00fee, or elys is taken fro the by deth or elly[s] by ony other maner, vnderstond \u00feou art smytte in the syde, for \u00feat \u00feou schuldiste go oute of the preson of inordinate loue, & sett \u00fein herte only in god \u00feat may not fayle \u00fee.  But take good heed \u00feat as Peter pleyned not vpon \u00fee smytynge in his syde, so \u00feou owest not to pleyne ne to gruche of tribulacion, which delyuerth the fro the false & disseyuable loue of flesshly & worldly frendis; & if the smytynge of tribulacion in the side be scharpe & greuouse to suffer, be-hold Crist thi maker & \u00fei brother wounded in the syde for \u00fei loue, & \u00feou schalte suffre it \u00fee more esily, as a trew kny&yogh;t when he seeth his lordis woundis, he felyth not his owen woundis.  Therfore refuse not \u00fei lordis messengers \u00feat commyne & clepe \u00fee with hym & constreyne \u00fee to haste toward hym; for he \u00feat refuseth \u00fee messengere, refuseth his lord.  Whan is a messengere refused?\n\n\n \n\nwhan the herte with avisement contrarieth & grucchith a-yence tribulacion.  Note well \u00feat tribulacion turmentith in purgynge, and it purgith in turmentynge; but when the herte grucchyth a-yence tribulacion, \u00fean he partith purgynge fro turmentynge of tribulacion, & he leseth the swete & profitable purgynge \u00feorow his foly & contrarious grochynge. Of the VI profet of tribulacion. Capitulum VI m . The sixte profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it is a &yogh;efte in payinge of \u00fei dettis in which \u00feou art boundyn to god, whom \u00feou may not flee ne disseiue ne hyde no\u00feinge fro hyme ofe \u00fei dettis.  These dettis bene pennaunce which \u00feou owest for thy synnes; & \u00feou&yogh;e euerlastyng pennaunce be det for on dedly synne by the ry&yogh;twisnesse of god, neuerthelesse by his mercy it is chaunged in to temporall pennaunce by contricion & confession, & ferthermore it is for-yeuen by satisfaccion.  & som-tyme it is all relesed namely by tribulacion.  Wherof vnderstond well; ffor what-so-euer thow suffreste paciently in trybulacion, afore god it is acompted to hym as a fore-paymente of thy dette.  For as a lordis auditor som-tyme in the ende of acompte leyth a cownter of brasse or coper or a nother \u00feinge of a lytyll value to be worth or sygnifie an hundri\u00fee pound of gold or syluer, so tribulacion of lytill tyme, with pacience receyued in \u00feis present lyfe, delyuerth \u00fee from euerlastynge tribulacion of \u00fee peynes of hell, & bryngeth \u00fee into euerlastynge blisse of the rich kyngdom of heuen.  Wherof we hane ensample of the \u00feefe \u00feat hynge on Cristis ry&yogh;t syd, \u00feat, when he suffred \u00fee tormente of \u00fee crosse & was bound by du det of syn to peyne of hell, he, hauynge contricion of his wickidnesse, in \u00feat same oure turned hym to [his lord & seyde: 'Lorde, when \u00feou comest in to \u00fei kyngdom,] \u00feenke on me': & anone he was vnbounde & delyuerd from all \u00fee dette of peyne & herd \u00fee swete voice of Crist seiyng to hym: Amen dico tibi, hodie mecum eris in paradiso, Sothly I sey \u00feou schalt to-day be with me in paradise.  Wo to hym \u00feat no\u00feinge payeth of his dette in \u00feis lyfe, but addith syn vpon syn; wo to hym: of large expencis \u00feat he makith he schalbe constreyned to com to streyte accomptis.  So\u00feely such as hath leued euer with-oute acomptis, must pay for her dettis euerlastynge payne in hell with-owte any relese.  \u00deer schullen wepe many marchauntis \u00feat in \u00feis lyf law&yogh;hen & ioyen; wherof it is seyd in \u00fee boke of Apocolipsis: Mercatores terre flebunt, Marchauntis of \u00fee er\u00fee schullene wepe.  Marchauntis of the erth, arne \u00feo \u00feat sett all \u00feer \u00feou&yogh;t & her loue on er\u00feely \u00feingis; which shullen wepe bitterly, ffor god schall schew her marchaundyse to all the world.  But marchauntis of heuen, \u00feei schullene law&yogh;e & enioye, for \u00feei for suffryng lyttill schort tribulacion hane gette the blysse of paradyse; where-of yt is seyd in Ecclesiastici: Est qui multum redimit de modico precio, Some \u00feer bene \u00feat byen much \u00feinge with lyttill price, \u00feat is to seye, pacience in tribulacion of this present lyfe, \u00feat god receyueth for \u00fei gret dette, for it is communly seid: 'of an euyll payer men receyueth otis for whete'.  & \u00feou&yogh;e it be so \u00feat \u00feou arte not bounde in eny dette of dedly syne or veniall fro which tribulacion schulde delyuer the, neuerthelesse tribulacion reseruith the frome fallynge into dette, [for] as seynt Gregor seith: Multa sunt innocencia que cito innocenciam perderent, nisi ea tribulaciones p[reseru]arent, Many ben innocentus the which schuld lese innocensi, but yf tribulacion preserue hem.  Therfor \u00feou soule \u00feat fyndest \u00fee bounde in dettis, or \u00feou \u00feat dredist \u00fee payment, suffer paciently tribulacions as longe as tyme indureth, hyt payeth to god for \u00fein dettis in the which \u00feou arte bounden as by an oblygacion.  For \u00feou&yogh; all \u00fee tribulacion[s] of \u00feis world weryne to-gyder, \u00feei my&yogh;t not be lykened to \u00fee leste payne of tribulacion of hell.  Ne all \u00fee tribulacion[s] of erth be not in com-\n\n\n \n\nparisone of the leste ioye of paradyse, as seynt Poule seith: Non sunt condigne passiones huius temporis ad futuram gloriam que reuelabitur in nobis, Ad Romanos octauo; Ther be non worthi passions of \u00feis tyme to \u00fee blysse \u00feat is to come \u00feat schalbe shewed in vs.  Vpone \u00feis seithe seynt Bernard: Non sunt condigne passiones ad preteritum peccatum quod nobis dimittitur, ad presentem gloriam que nobis inmittitur, Ther be no worthy passions to \u00fee syne \u00feat is foryeuen us, to \u00fee present grace \u00feat is yeue[n] us, [&] to blisse commynge \u00feat is be-hy&yogh;t vs. Of \u00fee seuenth prophet of tribulacion. Capitulum septimum. The seuenth profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it spredith a-brode or opynneth \u00fein herte to receyue \u00fee grace of god.  For gold with many strokis of the hammer spredith abrode, as a pece of gold or of syluer to make a vessell for to put in wyne or preciouse licoure; so all-my&yogh;ty god makith of euery creature, & ordeyneth tribulacion to sprede or open the soule to put \u00feer-in &yogh;eftis of his grace.  Wherof seith the prophet in \u00fee salme: In tribulacione dilatasti michi, In tribulacion thou hast spred abrode \u00fee herte, in suffrynge paciently & \u00fee more gladly &yogh;eftis \u00feat oure lord god putteth therin graciouslye.  & considre as \u00fee more [pre]ciouse metall is more ductible & obeyinge to \u00fee strokis of \u00fee goldsmyth, so \u00fee more prec[i]ouse & meke herte is more pacient in tribulacion.  & all-\u00feou&yogh; \u00fee scharpe stroke of tribulacion greuously turmentith \u00fee, yet comforte \u00fee, for \u00fee goldsmyth, almy&yogh;ti god, holdynge \u00fee hammer of tribulacion in his honde, knoweth full well what \u00feou maist suffre, & mesureth his smytynge after \u00fei freel nature.  Ne will not \u00feou be \u00fean as metall in a boystous gobette, with-owte spredynge of schape, as hard hertis bene with-oute techynge, in which god fynt no place in worchynge.  Ne will \u00feou not be as an oold fryinge-panne \u00feat for frelte of a lytill stroke [al to-breste in mannys brekynge; right so farin frele & impacient hertis in tribulacion, by a litille stroke] in temptacion of assayinge \u00feei fall in to many gret harmys of apayrynge.  Therfor suffre with good will tribulacion to worch his crafte in \u00fee; for so byddith Salomon Ecc i . II o : Sustine sustentaciones dei coniungere [te] deo, & sustine ut crescat in nouissimo uita tua, Suffer \u00fee berynge\u2014vp of \u00fee helpis of god to ioyne \u00fee to god, & suffre, \u00feat \u00fei [lyfe] increce at \u00fei laste ende; as who seith: Suffer tribulacion in \u00feis world for god, for whi god suffred many for the, & yeld hym somwhat \u00fee whyle of his seruyse; & what tribulacion he putteth to the, take it mekely, & know well \u00feat he woll not charge \u00fee ouer \u00fei my&yogh;t, as seynt Poule wittenessith, ad Corinth. X o : Fidelis [est], deus, qui non pacietur vos temptari super id quod potestis, Sothly god ys full trew, \u00feat schal not suffre you to be temptid ouer \u00feat ye mow suffre.  Therfor suffre tribulacion in such maner, \u00feat \u00fei lyfe increce at \u00fee laste ende; for \u00feer-by \u00feou schalt leue after \u00feou hast made ende in \u00feis world. Of \u00fee VIII profet of tribulacion. Capitulum VIII. The VIII profet of tribulacion is whereby god shettith owte of the soule all worldly comfortis \u00feat bene here-benethe, & constreyneth \u00fee to seke heuenly comfortes \u00feat bene above.  As an erthly lord, whan he wyll sell hys wyne, forbyddith all o\u00feer to open her tauernes, till \u00feat he haue sold his: so oure lord god som-tyme forbyddyth erthly comfortis, \u00feat he may brynge forth hys comforte.  & \u00feat is tokened by the prophet Ioell where it is seyd: Bestie agri quasi arena sciciens ymbrem suspexerunt ad te: quoniam exsiccati sunt fontes aquarum, The\n\n\n \n\nbestis of the feeld bene as drye erth desyrynge reyne, \u00feey loken vp to the, for \u00fee wellis of watris ben drye.  The bestis of the feld ben clepid affeccions & flesshly desyres, the wellis of \u00fee water he clepith worldly comfortis; \u00feerfor whan \u00fee erthly confortis faylen in aduersite, \u00fean is \u00fee herte constreyned to loke vp & to seke help of heuenly comfortis; and so much more benynge is oure lord god to the soule, in asmuch as \u00fee hert fynt gretter bitternesse in inward \u00feingis.  But now by these \u00feingis \u00feou maist sei: '[Of] \u00feat I am not sory \u00feat \u00fee tauerne of er\u00feely comfortis is not opyn to me, but for \u00fee tauerne of heuenly comfort is so longe shit fro me, for ne\u00feer hy&yogh;er ne lower I fynd no comforte'.  To \u00feis may be answered \u00feus: \u00deou owest to haue gostly comforte, yf \u00feou besy the desyrynge & sekynge, for \u00feer is more myrth in the desyrynge & sekynge of god \u00fean [in] delytinge in hym; for whi \u00fee more \u00feou desirest & sekyst god, \u00fee more comforte he schal brynge \u00fee, & \u00fee more swetnesse \u00feou schalt fynde in hym, as mete sauereth more to an hungry man \u00fean to an vnhungrye man; & wit \u00feou well \u00feat heuenly comfortis schul not longe be deferred, yf worldly comfortis be shette owt by tribulacion, yf \u00feou aske desyryngly & seke besylye, as Salomone seyth: Desiderium suum iustis dabitur, To ry&yogh;twismen schalbe &yogh;euen her desyre &c. Of the IX th profet of tribulacion. Capitulum nonum. The IX profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it putteth \u00fee vnto the mynde of god, & \u00fee more \u00fee tribulacion be, \u00fee more he impressith \u00fee in his mynde.  Not for \u00feat god for&yogh;etteth \u00fee or eny creature, \u00fee which sei\u00fee & knoweth all \u00fee preuyte of \u00fee herte, but for \u00feat scripture seith god foryettith a man \u00feat tribulacion ys not &yogh;euene to; ffor hym \u00feat he sendyth tribulacion he hath in mynd, &yogh;euynge goostly comforte & incresynge of grace.  Therfor O \u00feou good soule, &yogh;ef \u00feou wilt be put in \u00fee mynde of god in whoes mynd is \u00fein helth & \u00fei saluacion\u00af, in whoes foryettynge is \u00fein harme & \u00fei dampnacion, leren \u00feerfor to suffre paciently aduersitees & tribulacions, & in \u00fei suffring \u00feinke mekely in god, & he eftsons schall \u00feinke mekly on the & merciably; for a trew frend \u00feinketh more frendly on his frende \u00feat is in disese, \u00fean yf he were withowte desese.  In figure here-of oure lord seith Ex o III o : Vidi affliccionem populi mei qui est in Egipto, & clamorem eius audiui, I haue seyen the desesis of my peple \u00feat is in Egipt, & I haue herd hyr cryinge for \u00fee duresse of hem \u00feat bene ouerseers of \u00fee werkes, & I know her sorrow, & I haue goo downe to delyuer hem from \u00fee hondis of \u00fee Egipcions.  Therfor all-\u00feou&yogh; \u00fee Egipcions, \u00feat is to sey euell men or enemyes, turmentyne & desesyn \u00fee, be \u00feou comforted, for \u00fee merciable beholdynge of god in \u00fei disese much more avayleth the; as we redine of Dauid, II Regum XVI o , ffleyng from his sone Absolone, \u00feat Semey, which was Dauid his enemye, cursed hym & spake euel to hym & seyd: Egredere egredere, uir sanguinum & uir Beliall, as who seith go \u00fei weye go thi wey, \u00feou mane of synnes & \u00feou man of Belyall; and Abisay, \u00feat was Dauid is frend, seynge \u00feis seyd to kyng Dauid: 'This dede hounde hath mysseyd or cursed my lord the kynge; I schal goo & smyte of his heed': & Dauid answerd: 'Suffer hym to mysseye or curse Dauid vp \u00fee commaundement of god; perauenture god will be-hold my desese & yeld me good for his mysseyinge & cursynge \u00feis same daye'.  Considre in \u00feis \u00feat Dauid wold suffer \u00fee mysseyinge or \u00fee cursynge of \u00feis aduersarye, \u00feat he my&yogh;t gett \u00fee blissynge of god; \u00fean loke how much \u00feou desire[st] \u00fee blessynge of god, suffer so much paciently \u00fee mysseyinge or cursynge of \u00fee aduersarye, ffor pacience of euell mennys cursynge disserueth to haue goddis blissynge.  & \u00feat is tokened where it is seyd Daniel III o : That the angel went doun with A&yogh;arye & his felowes in to \u00fee forneis, & he made \u00fee myddes of the forneis as a blowynge wynde of a dewe; but \u00fee flame brent \u00fee kyngis mynisters \u00feat hett \u00fee forneis, but sothly \u00fee fyre touched not ne greued hym in any maner.

Therfor yf \u00feou desyre refresshynge in tribulacion, & \u00fein enemyes to be brent, suffer paciently tribulacions, for in tribulacion god is with \u00fee, & fro tribulacion he schall delyuer the, & for tribulacion gret meed he schall yeld the.  Of thes thre spekyth \u00fee prophete where he seith \u00feus: Cum ipso sum in tribulacione, eripiam eum, et glorificabo eum, I am with hym in tribulacion\u2014lo here a graciouse fellowshyp comfortyng; I schall delyuer hym\u2014lo here a full feith of delyuerynge; & I schall gloryfye hyme\u2014lo here a serteyne hope of rewardynge. The X profet of tribulacion. Capitulum decimum. The X profet of tribulacion is \u00feat it makith \u00fei praier to be herd of god; ffor it is note \u00fee maner of god to put awey the praier of hym \u00feat is in tribulacione, but rather mekely to here his prevy praier.  Wherof seith Salomon: Ecce deprecacionem lesi exaudiet, Lo oure lord schall here \u00fee praier of hym \u00feat is hurte.  Sothly god smytyth & chastiseth many men & sent hem tribulacion, for to compell hem to aske or to cry mercy, & \u00feat \u00feei schuldy[n] opyne hyr mouthes to god in tribulacion for to aske help, which hadden schett hyr mouthes frome hyme in prosperite.  Wherof seith seynt Austene \u00feat god sendith tribulacion to some men to styre hem to aske \u00feat he woll graunte.  In \u00fee persone of such seith \u00fee prophet: Ad dominum cum tribularer clamaui, et exaudiuit me, When I was in tribulacion, I cryed to oure lord, & he herd me.  & \u00feou&yogh;e-all it hap \u00feat in prosperite \u00feou prayest god, \u00feat prosperite schull not make \u00fee to slowe, yet neuertheles it makyth the sumetyme both insolente & slowe, so \u00feat \u00fei prayer in prosperite is not so spedfull as it [is] in aduersite.  & all-\u00feou&yogh;e aduersite occupye so much \u00fein hert \u00feat \u00feou \u00feenkest \u00feat it hath none entente ne deuocion lyke as it had in prosperite, yet \u00feat same aduersite makith \u00fei prayer more precious.  And sothely all-\u00feou&yogh;e tribulacion oppresse the so moch \u00feat \u00feou maist not open \u00fei mouth to crye to god, certeinly thi tribulacione crieth and prayeth to god for \u00fee, so \u00feat \u00feou haue pacience; for as seith a gret clerke, Magister Petrus, of La&yogh;ar, That als many woundis, so many prayers or cryers he had to god: ffor when La&yogh;ar stilled with his mouth, his woundis cryeden to god for hym.  Wherof oure lord seyd to Cayme \u00feat had kylled his broder Abell, Genes.: Vox sanguinis fratris tui Abel clamat ad me de terra, The blood of thy broder Abell crieth to me fro the erth.  Thus \u00fean ite schewyth \u00feat tribulacion makith the prayer \u00fee more preciouse & \u00fee more acceptable to god.  Tribulacions ben as it were a payment for a letter seled of delyueryng; wherof seith Iob: Quis michi det ut ueniat peticio mea, et quod expecto tribuat michi deus; qui cepit me ipse me conuertat, soluat manum suam et succidat me, & [hec] michi sit consolacio ut affligens me dolorem non parcat: Who sch l geve me myn askynge, & who schal graunt me \u00feat I abyde?  god \u00feat began me, he comforte me, louse he his hondis & cut me vp, & \u00feat be to me comforte \u00feat he turmentynge me spare not my sorrow.  Note well \u00feat Iobe, which had lost his possessions, his sonnes & his dou&yogh;ters, & all his body was smyten with woundes of leper fro \u00fee sole of the fote vnto \u00fee ouer-parte of \u00fee heed, & was repreued of his frendis & scorned of his wyfe, he desired in none other \u00feinge comforte, but \u00feat god schulde not spare hym.  Yf \u00feou aske what perteyneth [it] to his delyueraunce, hit may be answered \u00feus: he asketh his affliccion or turmentis, for his turmentis wer paymentis of his dettus; [as] it is vsed in som place \u00feat whan a pore man drynketh in a tauerne & hath not wher-with to paye his scott, he asketh to be bettun & so to be delyuerde.

Therfor \u00feat god spare \u00fee in tyme commynge, suffer paciently here in \u00feis world tribulacion; for tribulacion sauith the soule, as Iob seith: Ipse vulnerat & medicinat, he wondyth & he helyth; for he woundeth the body, & helyth the soule. Of the XI profett of tribulacion. Capitulum vndecimum. The XI profit of tribulacion is \u00feat it kepi\u00fee & norissheth \u00fee herte.  Sothly ry&yogh;t as fyre is kept in asshis, ri&yogh;t so \u00fee hertis of \u00fee frendis of god arne kept in tribulacion.  Therfor oure lord commaunded Exodi, quod tabernaculum saccis silicinis cooperi[re]tur: \u00feat \u00fee tabernacle of god schuld be heled with heren sackis, and goddis rich vessellys of gold & siluer a-yence wyndis & reynes; in tokenynge \u00feat vertues of goddis seruauntis, & namly mekenesse, ben kept in aduersite of tribulacion.  For tribulacion inforceth the herte to \u00feenke on \u00fee wrecchidnesse of his owen infirmitee, & so it constreyneth a man to be meke, whan worldly prosperite had enhaunced hym be veyne-glorye above hym-selfe.  Also tribulacion noryssheth the herte, as a norice her chyld.  For as a moder with chyld cheweth hard mete, which the chyld may [not] chewe, & drawith it in to her body where \u00feat mete is turned into mylke to norissh the chyld, so Crist, \u00feat in holy chirch is clepid oure moder for \u00fee gretnesse of hys tendyr love \u00feat he hath to vs, he chewed for vs bitter paynes, hard wordis, repreves & sclaundrys, with bitternesse of his passione \u00feat he suffred for us, to noryssh us & strengh us gostly by ensample of hyme to suffer tribulacions & aduersitees of \u00feis world.  As wyne \u00feat is clensed \u00feorrow a bage-ful of spicis, chaungith his owen sauoure, drawynge to hym the sauour of \u00fee spicis, so a man suffrynge tribulacion oweth to clense hyme by the blessed body of oure lord Ihesu, considerynge \u00fee passyon \u00feat he suffred for hym; & so schul it be swete & tollerable, \u00feat to-fore semed full bitter & vntollerable &c. Of the XII profett of tribulacion. Capitulum duodecimum. The XII profet of tribulacion is \u00feat tribulacion is a certeyne tokyne of loue \u00feat god hath to hem \u00feat [it] is sente to.  Wherof he seith: Quos amo, arguo & castigo, Hem \u00feat I loue I vndernym & chastiseth.  & also Salomon seith Ecc i .: Qui diligit filium, assiduat ei flagella, He \u00feat loueth his sone, he scorgith it ofte-tymes.  Whereof seith seynt Ierome: Summus \u00feater Ihesus Christus filios suos semper sub aliquo flagello uel uirga retinet, ut quando eripiuntur ab vno, sub alio capiuntur: Oure sauyoure fader Ihesu Criste kepith euer his children vndyr a scorge or a rodde, & whene \u00feei bene delyuerd of oone \u00feei bene caw&yogh;t of a nother.  But oure god meke fader sent not all his scorgyngis all at onys togeder, but one after another, knowynge oure frelte; ffor he will \u00feat no mane perisshe, but he will \u00feat all men be saafe.  But euell men & wicked \u00feat leuen hym not ne louyn hym notte, \u00fee which leuen with-owte scourge or tribulacion, whan no correccion of chastisynge may with-drawe heme fro her errowris, God schal ponyssh with all his arowes of vengeaunce.  For sothly all tormentis \u00feat now ben departed abow&yogh;t in all \u00feis world, than schulbe gadered to-gider & abyde as in her owen place; as oure lord seith Deuteronomii XXXII o : Congregabo super eos mala, & sagittas meas complebo in eis, I schal gader to-gider euell \u00feingis vpone euell\n\n\n \n\nmen, & I schall spende all myne arowes of vengeaunce amonge hem.  \u00deerfor \u00feou good saule, yf \u00feou will be loued of god, will \u00feou not put awey tribulacions, for \u00feey schewen to \u00fee wittnesse & tokens of \u00fee loue of god.  But perauenture yf \u00feou seiest \u00feat goddis childerne take of hym bo\u00fee good \u00feingis & euell \u00feingis, [why is \u00fee] takynge of euell \u00feingis schewynge or tok[n]ynge of \u00fee loue of god more \u00fean \u00fee takynge of good \u00feingis?  To this may be answeryd \u00feat god geuyth many good \u00feingis & gret to his spiritual frendis, & better & gretter to hem \u00feat he loueth more; but \u00fee blissed fader of heuen louith with-oute comparisone more his blissed sone oure lord Ihesu Crist \u00fean all \u00fee world, & yet he sent hym here many anguyshis, pouertees, tribulacions, aduersitees, sclaunders, repreves, scornyngis, many woundis, & cruell deth, & but fewe temporall goodis.  Than is \u00fee &yogh;efte of aduersite more schewynge [or] tokyne of loue of god \u00fean \u00fee &yogh;efte of temporall prosperite.  Also for\u00feermore oure lord Ihesu Criste goddis sone, \u00feat leued here in \u00feis world, as a wise marchaunte vsed to ches good marchaundyse & refused \u00fee bad; for when \u00feei wold haue maade hym kynge of Iude, he refused it & ches rather to flee in to deserte, & when \u00feei sou&yogh;t him to turment hym & to sle hym, he fled not but ches rather for to deye & seid Ego sum, I am he whome &yogh;e sech.  \u00dean yf Crist was wisest in chesynge, \u00fee which ches aduersitees, \u00feei bene moch folys \u00feat dispisene tribulacion & aduersitees, & chosyn worldly prosperitees \u00feat may not delyuer hem in tyme commynge from \u00fee handis of her enemyes, the cruell fendis.

Therfor a-yence dispeire for to induce hym \u00feat is syke & laborith in his dying to verry trust & confidence \u00feat he schuld principally haue to god at that tyme, the disposicion of Criste in the crosse schuld grettly draw hym, of the which seynt Bernard seith thus: What man is it \u00feat schuld not be rauysshed & draw to hope & to haue full confidence in god, & he take heed diligently of the disposicione of Cristis body in the crosse; take heed & see his heed enclyned to salue the, his mouth to kysse the, his armes I-spred to be-clyp the, his hondis I-thrilled to yeue the, his syde opened to loue the, hys body alonge strau&yogh;t to yeue all hym-selfe to the.  Therfor no man schuld dispeire [of] foryevenesse, but fully haue hope & confidence in god; for the vertu of hope is gretly commendable & of gret merite before god, as the apostill seith & exortith us: Nolite amittere confidenciam vestram, que magnam habet remuneracionem, Lesith not youre hope & confidence in god, \u00fee which hath gret reward of god.  Forthermore \u00feat no synfull man schuld in no wyse dispeire haue he synned neuer so gretly ne neuer so sore ne neuer so ofte, ne neuer so longe contynued therin, we haue [open] ensample [in] Peter \u00feat denyed Crist, in Poule \u00feat pursued holy chirch, in Matheu & &YOGH;ache the publicanes, in Mary Maudeleyne the synful woman, in the woman \u00feat was takyn in avoutry, in the thefe \u00feat honge on the crosse be-sid Crist, in Mary Egipciane, & vnnomberable o\u00feer greuouce & grete synners.  The thrid temptacion is in-pacience, the which is ayenst charite bi the which we be bounden to loue gode above all \u00feingis: for \u00feei \u00feat bene in syknesse in her deth-bed suffren passyngly gret payne & sorrow & woo, & namly they \u00feat dyen not be nature & course of age \u00feat hapynneth ryght selde as [open] experience scheweth all daye to euery mane, but dyen oft-tymes thorow an accidentall seknesse, as a fever, a posteme & such other greuous & paynfull & long seknes, the which many men, & namly hem the which bene vndisposed to dye & dyen ayenst her wyll, & lackene verry charite, makyth so inpacyent & grucchynge, \u00feat other-while thorow woo & inpacience \u00feei be-com wood & witles, [as] it hath ofte be seyen in many men; & so be \u00feat it is open & certeyne \u00feat \u00feey \u00feat dyen in \u00feat wyse faylen & lac verry charite, wittnessynge seynt Ierome \u00feat seith \u00feus: Si quis cum dolore egritudinem uel mortem suscipit, signum est quod deum sufficienter non diligit, that is to seye: Who so takyth syknesse [or deth] with sorrow & displesaunce of herte, it is ane open sygne \u00feat he louyth not god sufficiently.  Therfor a man \u00feat wyll dey well, yt is nedfull \u00feat he gruche not in no maner of seknesse \u00feat fallyth to hym be-fore his deth or in hys dyinge, be yt neuer so paynefull or greuouse, longe tyme or schort tyme durynge; for as seynt Gregory witnessith in his Morallys: Iusta sunt [cuncta] que patimur, et ideo valde iniustum est si de iusta passione murmuremus: All \u00feingis \u00feat we suffren we suffyr ryghtfully, & \u00feerfor we ben vnry&yogh;tfull yf we grucch of \u00feat we suffer ry&yogh;tfully. Than euery man schuld be pacient, [for] as seynt Luke seith: In paciencia vestra possidebitis animas vestras: In youre pacyence ye schull possesse youre soules; for [as]\n\n\n \n\nbe pacience mannys soule is trewly had and kept, so be vnpacience & murmuracion it is loste & dampned, wittnessyng seynt Gregory in his omely \u00feat seith \u00feus: Regnum celorum nullus murmurans accipit, nullus qui accipit murmurare potest, Ther schal no man haue \u00fee kyngdom of heuen \u00feat grucchit[h] & is inpacient, and ther may no man gruch \u00feat hath it.  But as \u00fee gret clerke Albert seyth, spekyng of verry contricion: [If] a verry contrite man offerryth hym-selfe gladly to all maner affliccion of seknesse & ponysshynge of his synnes, \u00feat he may therby satisfye god worthyly for his offensis: moch more [\u00fean] schuld euery sike man suffer paciently & gladly his owen seknesse a-lone, \u00feat is ly&yogh;ter withoute comparison \u00fean many syknessis \u00feat other men suffer; namlye sythen \u00feat siknes be-fore a mannys de\u00fee is as a purgatory to hym whan \u00feat it is suffred as it ought, \u00feat is to vnderstonde, yf it be suffred pacientlye & gladly, with a fre [kynd] wyll of herte.  For as the same clerke Albert seyth: we hane neede to haue a free kynd wyll to god not only in such \u00feingis as bene to oure [consolacion, but also in such \u00feingis as bene to oure] affliccion.  [And] seynt Gregor seyth: Diuina dispensacione agitur ut prolixiori vicio prolixior egritudo adhibeatur, It is do by the dispensacion & \u00fee ry&yogh;tfull ordynacion of god \u00feat to the lenger syn is ordeyned the lenger siknesse.  & \u00feerfor lett euery sykman & namely he \u00feat schall dye, sey as seynt Austen dyd to god: Hic seca, hic vre, ut ineternum michi parcas, Here cutt, here brenn, so \u00feat \u00feou spare me euerlastynglye.  And seynt Gregor seith: Misericors deus temporalem adhibe[t] seueritatem, ne eternam inferat vlcionem, God \u00feat is mercyfull yeveth his chosyn children temporall ponysshyngis here, lest he yeve hem euerlastyng vengeaunce ellys-where.  This temptacion of inpacience fy&yogh;tteth ayenst charite, & with-oute charite may no man be saued; & therfor, as seith seynt Poule: Caritas [vera] paciens est, omnia suffert, Verry charite ys paciente & suffreth all \u00feingis.  & in \u00fees wordis yt is notably to be marked \u00feat he spake of suffryng of all \u00feingis, & oute-take no\u00feing: \u00fean schuld all syknesse of the body [bi reson] be suffred paciently without murmuracion or difficulte; and therfor seynt Austen seith: Amanti nichil difficile uel impossible, To hym \u00feat loueth ther is no \u00feinge hard ne no \u00feinge impossible.  The IIII th temptacion is complacens or plesaunce of a man \u00feat he hath in hym-selfe, \u00feat is spiritual prid, with the which \u00fee devyll temptyth & vexith most relygiouse & deuoute & parfite men; for when \u00fee deuel seth \u00feat he may not brynge a man oute of \u00fee fei\u00fee, ne may not induce hym vnto dispaire, ne into impaciens: \u00fean he assaileth hym be complacens of hymselfe, puttyng such maner of temptacions in his herte: O how stable arte \u00feou in \u00fee fei\u00fee, how stronge in hope, how sad in pacience!  O how many good dedis hast \u00feou do! & such o\u00feer \u00feou&yogh;ttis.  But ayenst \u00feese temptacions Isodur seith thus: Non te arroges, non te iactes, non te [insolenter] extollas vel de te presumas, nichil boni tibi tribuas, Ne bost \u00fee not, ne vaunte \u00fee not proudly, ne make not moch of thi-selfe wantonly, ne\u00feer adiecte no goodnesse to \u00fei-selfe.  For a man may haue so much delectacion in such [maner of complacens] of hym-selfe \u00feat a man schuld be dampnyd euerlastyngly \u00feerfor.  And \u00feerfor seynt Gregor seith: Quis reminiscendo bona que gescit dum se apud se erigit, apud auctorem humilitatis cadit: A man \u00feat \u00feinke\u00fee in good dedis \u00feat he hath do & is proud therof of hym-selfe, he fallith down anon \u00feerfor be-for hym \u00feat is auctor of meknes.  & \u00feerfor he \u00feat schall dye most be ware when he felith hym temptid with pride, \u00feat \u00fean he low & meke hym-selfe, \u00feinkinge in his synnes & \u00feat he wit neuer whe\u00feer he be wor\u00fei loue or hate, \u00feat is to sey saluacion or dampnacion.  Neuerthelesse, lest he dispayre, he mote lyfte vp his herte to god by hope, \u00feenkynge & remembrynge stably \u00feat \u00fee mercy of god is above all \u00feinge & all his werkis, & \u00feat god [\u00feat] is trewe in all his wordis, & \u00feat is treu\u00fee & ry&yogh;twysnes \u00feat nether begile\u00fee ne\u00feer is begiled, be-hight & swor by hym-selfe & seid by the prophet: Viuo ego, dicit dominus,\n\n \n\nnolo mortem peccatoris, God all-my&yogh;ti seith: be my lyfe, I will not the deth no\u00feer the dampnacion of no synner or of no synfull man, but \u00feat he conuerte hym-selfe to me & be saued.  Euery man schuld followe seynt Antonye to whome the deuell seyd:  'Antony, \u00feou hast ouercom me, ffor when I wold haue the vp by pride, \u00feou kepist \u00fei-selfe a-downe by meknesse, & whan I wold draw \u00fee downe by disperacion \u00feou kepist \u00fei-selfe vp by hope';\u2014thus schuld euery man do both seke & hole, & \u00fean ys the deuell ouer-com.

But it is to be noted well \u00feat the deuell in all \u00fee temptacions above-seid may compell no man, [neither] in no maner of wyse prevayle ayenst hym to consent to hym, als long as a man hath the vse of reason with hym, but if he woll wilfully consent to hym,\u2014\u00feat euery good cristen man & also euery synful man be he neuer so grete a synner ow&yogh;t to be were of aboue all thyngis.  For \u00fee apostell seyth: Fidelis [est] deus qui non pacietur vos temptari supra id quod potestis, sed faciet eciam cum temptacione prouentum ut possitis sustinere, God, he seith, is trew & will not suffre yow to be temptid more \u00fean ye may bere, but he will yeue yow such supportacion in youre temptacion[s] \u00feat ye may bere hem.

BRother or sustere that desyrest to come to the endeles blysse that mankynde was ordeyned to in hys fyrst creacion, whyche oure fadere Adame lost thorow brekyng off [the] commaundement off oure lorde gode, and commyttede to endeles trauayle, woo and payne, and alle mankynde in hym, that neuer shulde haue hade ende, ne hade oure lorde off hys endeles mercy becomyne mane; in the whyche manhode he suffrede gret peynes, trybulacions and sclaunders, reproues and shamefulle dethe vpone the rode-tree, the whyche was for pure lofe and conpassyone that he hade in mannes soule, and made aseeth to the fader in heuyne for the gylt off mankynde.  Also oure gracyous [lord] Cryste Ihesu, that ys bothe gode and mane, hath grauntede to alle tho that kepe hys commaundementis, louene vertew and hatyne syne, the pardone off hys mercyfulle redempcion, and there-ayens [to] alle tho that brekyne hys commaundementis and wolle nat restreyne hem fro synne and wyckydnes but enforse hem to lyfe in lustis and lykyngis and to fulfylle the apetytis off her fleysshly desyres, endeles peyne: and therfore, yeff thow wolt come to endeles blesse and avoyde frome endeles peyne, the be-houeth to haue in mynde that oure lord seyth by holy Iob: Milicia est vita hominis super terram, Iob 8 o , that ys: Alle mannes lyfe vpone erthe ys but fygthynge and knygthode ayenst gostly enemyes.  These enemyes bene the fende, the worlde, and the flessh.  And therfore the holy gost techeth vs in [the] booke of Wysdome, seying to eche mane thus: 'Son, when thow be-gynnest to serue gode, loke thow stande styfly in rygthwysnes and drede, and make redy thy soule to with-stonde the dysceytis off the fende'.  Also seynt Powle byddeth you to clothe yow in trewe armoures of gode, that ye mowe myghtyly with-stande the temptacions of oure enemyes.  For mannes body ys [as] a clothe in the whyche the soule ys clothede. Horse.  Also hit ys lykenede to an horse; for lyke as ane horse welle-taughte beryth hys mastere ouer many peryllys and saueth hym fro perysshyng, so the body welle-rewled bereth the soule ouer many peryllys of thys wrecched worlde. And lyke as ther longeth many thyngis to the horse thorow the whych hys mastere may sytte sadly and nat falle, and as there may noo mane fy&yogh;te ayenst hys enemy but yef hys horse be meke and mylde, ryght so the sowle may nat fyghte ayenst the deceytis off the fende but yef the body by meke and mylde; ffor yeff the body lyfe in lustis and lykyngis at hys oune wylle, hit ys lyke to peryssh the soule in the fyre off helle, for holy wrytte seyth: 'he that noryssheth hys body delycatly and lustyly, shalle fynde hym rebelle whene he leste weneth'. For assone as a mane wolle lyfe wysely after the lawes of gode and to fle the false lustes off thys worlde and to withstonde fflesshely desyres and to bowe hym vnder the yooke off goddys lawe, than begynneth hys enemyes to compasse hym with wyles and wrenches, to make hyme ouerthrowe frome the blysse that he ys ordeynede to, in to the horryble pytte off helle; wherffore hit ys behouefulle that the body be buxome and mylde to the soule in thys gostly batayle, yeff he shalle haue victory off hys enemyes.  For yeff the body and the sowle be welle accordede to-gydere and eche helpe othere in thys gostly batayle, thane shalle the enemyes soone fflee, ffor holy wryte seyeth: 'Withstande the ffende and he shalle flee fro the'.  But hit were grete ffoly for any mane to fyghte apone ane horse vnbrydelyde: ffor yeff he be wylde and off euylle condycions, he ys lyke to be hys masters confusyone and to cast hym in to the handes off hys enemyes, and therfore hit ys nedeffulle that he be brydelyde.  And yeff he be\n\n \n\nwylde and off euylle condycions, than nedeth the brydelle to be heuy and sumdele sharpe, to restrayne hyme from hys wyckyde lustys; and yef he be buxome and mylde, thane nedyth the brydelle to be softe and smothe. Brydylle.  Thys brydylle ys clepede Abstinence, with the whyche the fflessh shalle be refraynede from flesshly desires and worldely affecciouns to the loue off gode and heuynly desyres: for he ys wylde and wyllfulle, and lothe to bowe to goodnes, and therfore with thys brydelle thou must refreyne hyme tylle he be meke and mylde to the sowle.  And yeff [he] be wylde in flesshly lustis |and in worldely worschyppys, thane brydelle hym with sharpe abstynence, bothe with fastyng and wakyng and with honest occupacion doyng; for yeff thow on hym wolle fyghte and late hym lyfe after hys desyre, truste sekyrly that thow shalt be ouercome. And ther[to] refreyne hyme discretely with abstynence, so that the kynde be kepte in strengthe; for ellys he xalle fayle the att nede and [make \u00fee] lese the victory off thys gloryous batayle. Reynes.  The two reynes off thys brydelle shullene be two partyes off temperaunce: that ys to say, neythere to moche nere to lytelle, knytte to-gedyr by the knot off discrecione.  And holde the reynes euene to-gedyre by the knotte that none passe othere; ffor yeff any of hem be owte off mesure, hit wylle make thy horse to glyde a-syde, and so to lese the rygth waye of that gloryous blysse whyche mankynde was ordeyned to in hys furst creacion. That oone Reyene.  That one reyne ys to large whane thow suffrest thy flessh to haue to moche hys wylle in etyng and drynkyng, in slepyng, in spekyng, in veyne talys tellyng other in rebaudy, in lesyngis, in sweryng or any other vnprofytable talkyng.  Also hit ys to large yeff thow noryssh hit delycately in ouer-moche ease off softe lying, goyng, other syttyng, or in any othere thyng doyng that thow dost to fulfylle the [vnleful] desyres off thy flessh, and nat rewlede in mesure as reasone asketh.  For euery thoughte and euery worde and euery dede that a mane doth whyche ys nat pryncypally done in the worschyp off gode and to helpe and furtheryng off hys euy[n]crystene dewly and rygthfully as charyte asketh, hyt ys veyne, and synne, other venyalle or dedely synne, off whyche thow shalt yeue a ffulle streyte rekenyng at the dredeffulle day off dome, but yeff hit be amendyde in thys lyff here with sorow off herte and with confessyone and satisfaction makyng. That other Reyne.  That other ys to streyte whene thow art to sterne ayenst thyne oune fleyssh, in with-drawyng that reasone wolde that he hadde bothe in mete and drynke & slepe, or [by] any other vnresonable abstynence, where-thorow hit ys so ffebylle that hit may nat serue gode durably with feruent herte, with myghty desyre and with parfyte loue, but hit ys so ffebylle that hit may neythere pray ne werke ner speke as hit oughte, but lyeth stylle as a vnresonable beste with grete fantasyes and vnclene thoughtis be cause off ydelnes off the hede or for febylnes off the body; and so yeff thow be ouersterne agayne thy fflessh, hit may lette the in [this] gostly batayle.  And therfore susteyne thy body dyscretely, so that he be neyther to wylde ne to febylle, but of euene strengthe. For yeff thow suffre hyme to haue alle hys fulle lykyngis and desyres, thane he that shulde be thy beste ffrende wolle be thy fulle enemy; and yeff thow with-drawe from hyme that he ougth for to haue in susteynyng hys kynde by reasone, than thow dystroyest hys mygth, where-throwe he may nat helpe the to haue the victorye off thyne enemyes, but [is] rather lykely to be thy confusyone. A Sadylle.  Also thy horse be-houeth to haue a sadylle, that thow may sytte the more sadly and semely to othere mennes sygth.  Thys sadylle ys Pacience and Mekenesse; that ys to say, thow muste be pacient in aduersyte, both in sclaunders and reproues, in sekenes, in temptacion, in tribulacions, and in alle aduersytees, and so mekely resceue heme with dewe thankyngis to gode off hys gracyous vysytacions, thynkyng that thow were moche more worthy for thy grete offensys ande trespases that thow hast doone ayenst hyme.  Also what-so-euer\n\n \n\nthow doo, thynke or speke, that hit be do with goode avysement, [&] wysely to thynke on the begynnyng and on the endyng; and that hit be doo swetely, benygnely and with mylde chere, and greue the nat in no wyse.  And [\u00feoff] thy flessh be grogyng thorow freelte off hys oune corrupcion that he hath in hys oune kynde, yet kepe mekenes in herte, and late hit nat owte with wykkede wordes, but mekely resceue heme, and thynke that they bene grete matyers off mede in the blysse off heuene, and grete peyne to heme that doone so to the, wherfore thou owest to pray for heme with pure herte to almygthy gode, that they may haue grace off foryeuenes.  And yeff thow do thus, thow shalt be gladde, for the prophete seyth that 'the meke and the mylde suffryng trybulacions in rygthwysnes for goddys loue, shullene ioye'.  Therfore meke the with ale thy mygth, bothe inwarde with herte thynkyng, and owtewarde with goode dedis werkyng, so that other mowe be conuertede by thy goode example yeuyng, and thane shalt thow haue grace, off synnes forgyfnes and to encrese in vertew, and so to come to endeles blysse that mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion. Stirop.  The styropes of hys sadylle shalle be lownes and sadnes; lownes ayenst pryde, and sadnes ayenst worldly couetyse and flesshly lustis; so that thow be nat [to] sory for no wo, ne to glad for no wele ne welfare.  Now syt sadly in thys sadylle and kepe welle thy styroppys, that for no pryde off strengthe, off byrthe, off fayrnes, off kunnyng, or ryches, or any vertew that gode hath sent the other bodyly or gostly, thow be not cast owte off thy styroppes off lownes and sadnes.  Also [for] noo wrathe nere vnpacience for sekenes, or for losse off gode, ne losse of name, ne for no vysytacion that gode sendeth the, other sufferyng the fende to vexe the by temptacions, or by vexacion off thy euene-crystene, late nat thy horse caste the owte of thy sadylle off pacience; but sytte sadly and streyne thy ffeete in thy styroppys by the vertew [of] gostely strengthe, and doo as Cryste byddeth in the gospelle where he seyeth thus: In paciencia uestra possidebitis animas uestras, that ys: Ye shullene kepe your soulys in youre pacience.  And thane lyke as the sadylle maketh the horse semely and lusty to the eye off mane, so pacience and mekenesse makis the soule louely and amyable in goddys sygth, semely and gracyous in mannys sygth, euylle and confusyously in the fendys sygth. And there-ayenst wratthe and impacience, hastynesse and hygh fulnes in herte makyne a mane vngracyous ande hatefulle in goddys sygth, sporte and gladnes to alle the deuylles in helle, and increasyn the peynes that neuer shalle haue ende. Off thys sadylle oure lorde spake to Cayne whane he was wroth with hys brothere Abelle: 'Why, seyde oure lorde, art thow wroth, and why ys thy face and thy chere so fallene?' \u2014 for he was fallene owte of the sadylle of pacience in to the foule pytt of wretthe; 'for yeff thow doo welle, thow shalt resceue off me godde mede, and yeff thou do euylle, anone thy synne cometh to the yate, to be punysshede; but the desyre off synne shalle be vnder the and thy powere, [as] the horse vnder hys master, ande thow shalt be lorde thereoff yff thou wylle, Genes. 4 o , And so Cayn be mysgouernaunce off hys horse felle owte off the sadylle off pacience in to manslawghtere off hys brothere, be-cause he consentede to the wyckede desyres off hys flessh and wolde nat restreyne hym by the knotte off dyscrecion.  But sytte sadly Iob dyde, and sey as he seyde whane he had lost alle hys goode, and alle hys chyldrene were slayne and hym-self smytene with grete sekenes ful horryble; than he seyd: 'Yeff we hane take goode thyngis off goddis sonde, why shulle nat we suffre paynffulle thyngis off hys vysytacion?  Gode gaff and gode hath takene awey; as gode wolle so be itt doone, blessyde by oure lordis name, Iob 1 o & 2 o capit. The master off kynde telleth libro 4 o de qualitate elementorum, that there ys a byrde callede a barnake.  Thys byrde vexeth owte off a tree [ouer the watir, and \n \n\nals longe as it hongith one the tre] hit ys dede, but assone as hit loseth frome the tree and falleth into the water, anone hit ys quycke and swymmeth forth.  Thys byrde hath lytylle fflessch and lasse blood.  By thys tree I vnderstande mankynde that came off Adam ande Eue; by thys byrde I vnderstande euery crystene mane and womane; the whyche whane they be furst borne off here modere, be dede by orygynalle synne and nat able to the lyff off grace ne to blysse, for seynt Powle se[i]th: 'we be alle borne chyldrene off wrathe': but assone as we falle in to the fonte-stone and in watere off bapteme bene bapty&yogh;ede, anone we resceyue the lyff off grace and bene able to the blysse thate mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion, yeff we kepe vs fro the floode off syne.  Seynt Petyr byddeth vs in thyse wordes: Abstinete vos a carnalibus desideriis etc., 1 o Petri 2 o : 'Absteyne yow frome flesshly desyres that fyghtene ayenst the soule'.  Sythene thane that alle mannys lyff ys but fyghtyng ayenst gostly enemyes: therfore hit [ys] nedefulle to euery crystene mane nat only to gouerne welle hys horse, but also to be suerly armede for to withstande the strokys of hys enemyes.  Ryghte so hit ys nat Inowh to rewle thy body, but also thow must arme the with gostly armure to withstande the dyntis off the dartis off the deuyllis foundyng, for seynt Powle seyth Ad Eph. 6: Alle oure fyghtynge ys ayenst wyckyde spyrytes off derkenes, that ben prynces and gouernoures off synfulle mene.  'And therfore, he byddeth, arme yow in gostly armure off gode, so that ye mowe withstande the busshementis and the sleyghtis off the fende, and to stande stedefastly and parfytely in alle thyngis off ryghtwysnes.  Stondeth, he seyth, in trowthe, and gyrde you with the gyrdelle off chastyte, and doth one the habergeone off ryghtwysnes, and keuer &yogh;oure feete in dyghtyng (or makyng redy) of the gospelle off peese; and in alle thyngis take to you the shelde of feyth, with the whyche ye may quenche alle the dartis of youre enemyes.  And taketh to you the basnet off helthe, and the swerde off the holy gost, that ys goddes worde'; for, as he seyth in a nothere place, hit ys sharpere thene any two-egede swerde, Ad Hebre. 4.  Thus Seynt Powle by lykenes off bodyly armoure techyth vs gostely armure.  He byddyth yow arme yowre body by the vertew off trouthe that ys callede the Habergeoun off Ryghtwysnes; he byddeth you do ryghte to alle and yelde to gode that longeth to hyme, to youre euyncrystene that longeth to hem, bothe to youre sufferaynes and to youre felawes and to youre subgettis, and to hem that be passede owte off thys worlde with almesdede doyng and yeldyng off dettis, and to hem that bene to come in sauyng off her ryghte inherytaunce.  Thus armeth you with the habergeone of ryghtwyssnes, bothe be-fore and be-hynde and on eyther syde. And as in the habergeone euery ryng accordeth with othere and ys knytte in othere, so shulde alle trouthe accorde and be knytte to-gedere in ryghtwysnes; for yef ye fauour othere lorde or lady spiritualle or temporalle, souereyne or subgette, kyne or frende, or any creature hygh or lowe, so moche that [it] ys hynderyng to a nothers ryghte, than youre ryngis in youre habergeone accordyne nat ne be nat welle knytte to-gedere, but there ys ane hole where-thorow the fende may sle youre sowle.     And he byddeth that ye shalle arme youre leggis with gostly pouerte, so that youre hertis, and youre affeccions and youre desyres bene drawene frome erthely thyngis, and nat to sette youre loue to moche in worldely goodes ne flesshly lustis, neyther to stryue ne to plete for no worldely goode, but the more nede compelle, seeke to lyue in pease with alle mene yef ye mowene.  And thus arme yow with gostly pouerte bothe leggis and feete, that ys to sey youre loue and youre affections, ayenst temptacions off false couetyse.  And therfore he byddyth you shoo youre feet 'in makyng redy off the gospelle of peese'; for euery crystene mane or womane oughte to haue gostly pouerte, whyche Cryste taughte in the gospelle where he seyeth thus: Beati pauperes spiritu quoniam ipsorum est regnum celorum. Also thow owest to forthere the gospelle and susteyne bothe in worde, wylle and deede vn-to thy powere; yef thow be a preste, than preche hit and teche hit dewly and trewly, reuerentely and charytabely,\n\n\n \n\nwith meke herte and parfyte lyuyng, where-thorowgh sympelle mene that be nat letterede and hane noo power of prechyng and techyng as thow hast, may be stabelede in trewe feyth off goddis lawe to encrese in vertewe and to hate synne; and yef thow be a lay-mane, the behoueth to helpe ande susteyne heme that hane powere ande trewly techyne hit.  Also the be-houeth to here and to be-leue trewly one hit and in alle the sacrementis of holy churche, and nat [to] dyspute and ymagyne howe they myghte be so, but fully be-leve in heme, and so to conforme the in the lawes of gode and the ordynaunce off holy churche. Shelde.  And taketh to yow the shelde off feythe; for as a shelde ys a tryangle and hath thre corners, in whyche tryangle yef frome the myddes be drawene thre lynes in to [the] thre corners, ther shulle be thre tryangles, whyche thre be but oone tryangle and yet noone off heme ys othere; and therfore the feyth off the holy trynyte ys lykenede to a shelde, for there be III persones ande oo gode, the ffadere the sone the holy gost, and yche of heme ys gode ande none of heme ys othere, ande yet they be alle thre but oo gode in mageste: Thys shelde of feyth of the holy trynyte ye muste take to youe in gostly fyghte, and so to sett alle youre feyghte and alle youre truste in o gode in trynyte, and prayeth to the fader almyghty that ye may haue myghte and powere, to the sone alle-wytty that ye mowe haue wytte and wysdome, ande to the holy gost that ye mowe haue grace and mercy, and so to haue myghte, wytte, and grace, to with-stonde alle gostly enemyes.  Also ye muste take to yow the basnett of helthe, that ys hope off foryeuenes off alle the trespas that ye hane done ayenst gode, and to come to the endeles blysse off heuene thorow the endeles mercy that he schewyde in hys byttere passyone; and so to haue vyctory off [your] enemyes thorow hys gloryous vysytacions.  And lyke as hitt ys clene, brygth and smothe, that shote ande strokes mowe sone glyde off: so muste youre herte be clene, brygth ande smothe ffrom wyckede thowgthys, wyckede desyres and wyckede wylles.  Ande lyke as a basnet ys hyghest off alle armoure, goyng and gaderyng vpwarde in to a lytylle coppe: so muste youre hope ande youre truste pryncypally go vp to gode, and not to sette hitt to moche in mannys mygth ne in erthely goodys that ys but rust wastyng the basnett off helthe.  And therfore the prophete seyeth: 'Acursyde be he that setteth hys truste in mane ande in fflesshly mygth, and letyth hys herte goo away fro gode; and blessyde be he that settyth hys hope ande [truste] in oure lorde gode', Ieremi. 17.     Also seynt Powle byddeth you take vambrace and rerebrace and gloves of plate, that ys goode occupacions and besynes in gostly werkes eyther bodyly whyche be in helpyng and sauyng thy soule frome synne and wyckednes. And therfore he byddeth you laboure ande wake in honest werkes ande in kepyng goddis commaund[m]ente.  For the wysemane seyth Ecclesiast. 33 o : 'Idylnes ande slouthe ys cause off mochylle wyckydnes'.  For an Idyl mane ande lustles ys lykenede to a mane lustles ande handeles and wepynles amonge hys enemyes, or lyke a mane naked in bateylle, that for defaute off armure leseth bothe arme ande hande.  So mane beyng Idylle in sufferyng hys wyttis to wandyr aboute in wordely desyres and flesshly lustis and vnclene ymagynacions, ys lykely to lese the soule with-outene ende. Also ye muste gyrde you with a gyrdelle off chastyte: for lyke as a gyrdylle fast gyrte to a mane beryth vp the haberioune and saueth the body from akyng ande werynesse, so the gyrdelle off chastyte wele festenede in the loue off gode with clene thowghtis ande heuynly desyres, bereth vp the soule from the foule pytte off synne and strengtheth hyme in vertew and goodenesse.     Also ye muste haue the Iakke off fence that ys Charyte: ffor as the Iakke thorough the nesshenes and softenes that ys in hitt, feynteth ande wasteth alle the dyntes off thy enemyes that cometh ayenst hit, so charyte feynteth and wasteth alle the dyntes off thy enemyes; ande therffore Seynte Powle seyth Ad Cor. 14: Caritas omnia suffert, omnia sustinet, that ys: 'charyte suffreth alle thynges paciently, and maketh euery trauayle soft, and beryth alle thyng esyly'.  Also the glose seyth there that\n\n \n\ncharyte, pacience and benignite, with compassyone-hauyng off othere mennys myscheff, bene the pryncypalle armoure that longeth to Crystis peple.  Thys Iacke off charyte ys betokenede by the clothe off Cryste withoutene seme alle wouene aboue in to oone, [which] in tyme off hys passyone the knyghtys wolde not kytte hit but kepte hit hole and castyde lott therfore, in tokyne that euery goode knyght off gode besyly shulde arme hyme with the cloth off charyte to saue pease ande vnyte among alle mankynde to hys power.  For the ende off euery batayle shulde be peese, and to that ende ant to no other shulde euery mane fygth, as seyth seynt Powle thus: leue ffrendes, I pray yow to arme yow in gostly armoure as goddys knyghtis; for though ye be natt able to bodyly fygth, yet be ye able to gostly fygth, and in that ye be crystenede ye Crystis knyghtis beene to fygth in gostly batayle, yeff we wylle come to the blysse off heuene. Swerd.  Also taketh with yow the swerde off goddis worde with the whych ye shulle defende yow from youre enemyes.  For as the swerde peryssheth, kutteth and maketh separacion, so goddys worde be prechyng, redyng or heryng cutteth and maketh separacion be-twene the soule and synne, frome flesshly desyres and from wordly couetyse.  And therfor Cryst seyde he came nat to make synfulle peese, but to sende the swerde off separacion in erthe to dystroye wyckede peese that mene hane in theyr hertis with synne.  Therfore, goode frendys, as goode knyghtis haueth with youe the swerde of goddis worde bothe be heryng, redyng, and by dede werkyng. Spere.  And thane taketh with youe the speare of Crystis passyone.  Furst taketh hede how hys hede was crownede with a croune off thorne that went in to hys brayne, & the bloode brestyng oute one euery syde, to dystroye the hygh synne off pryde.  For lyke as the hede ys hyghest and most worthy of the vtter partes off mane, so pryde ys worst off alle synnes and most vnworthy in the sygth off gode.  Take hede how hys armes were spredde abrode and drawene ffulle strayte in the tre tylle alle the synewes and veynes brestyne a-sondre, and hys hondys smytene thorowe with raggede nayles to the tre, and how grete stremes off bloode ranne owte, to dystroye the synne of wyckede werkes that mane doth with hys wykede handes.  Take hede how hys syde was openede ande hys herte clovyne a-two with a sharpe spere, and how he shadde owte both bloode and water, the whyche [shewed] that yef he had hade more bloode, more he wolde haue yeuene for mannys soule to the fader of heuene; and water, to wasshe vs frome oure synne.  Also he suffrede thys to dystroye pryde, couetyse, enuye, hate, wratthe and malyce, that renneth most in mannes herte and womans.  Take hede how hys feete were naylede to the tree streynyng oute bloode, to dystroye the synne of slouthe in goddys seruyce and in the VII dedys of mercy doyng.  Take hede how hys body was alle for-rente and alle to-tore with scharpe scourgis that frome the sole off the fote to the top off the hede there was noone hoolle place, and that was to dystroy the synne of lust and lechery that reygneth in mannes body & womans.  Take hede how nakede and pore he hynge vpone the tree, to dystroye the synne of couetyse and wordely worschyppe.  Take heede how he dranke eyselle and galle, to dystroye the synne of glotonye.  And so he suffrede payne in alle partyes of hys gloryous body, to dystroye alle synne[s] in mannys [body] and womans.  Thys spere of Crystis passyone ys the best and sykerest wepyne ayenst oure enemyes.     [More]ouere ye schalle vnderstande that a wyse mane off armes wolle chese hym a goode grounde and a playne to fygth in, for itt ys perlyous to fygth in mory grounde or in stobely grounde or in pytty grounde.  And therfore seynt Powle techeth yow stonde [fast] in trowthe and equyte, that in alle youre doyng ye loke that youre grounde and youre cause be god and trewe, rygthfulle, clere and clene fro couetyse.  And a wyse knygth wylle haue with hym the hylle and the sonne and the wynde.  One the same wyse must ye in thys gostly fyght take with you the hylle of good lyuyng, that ye may sey with the apostylle: Nostra conuersacio in celis est, that ys: 'oure conuersacione ys in heuyns and in heuynly thyngis', and therfor seynt Powle byddeth you stonde parfytely in these thyngys.  Also ye must haue the sonne and the lygth of goddis grace, and the wynde off holy prayere, the whyche ys a specyalle remedy to gete grace to withstande temptacions of oure enemyes. Sporys.  Also ye muste haue a peyre of sporys, the whyche muste be sharpe to pryke with youre horse yef nede be, that he stynte nat in hys weye, ffor many horsys be dulle and slowe in theyre iorney but they be pryked.  These sporys shalle be loue and drede of gode, whyche among al othere vertues displesyne most the fende and sonnest bryngeth a mane or woman to heuyne-blysse. Rigth spore.  The rygth spore ys loue that mane oweth to god for the grete and excellent goodnesse that he [hath] shewed and sheweth at alle tymes.  Furst how he made man off noughte to hys gloryous lykenes, and made hyme lorde of alle erthely thyngys; and for that excellent loue \u00feat he schewed to mankynde in hys mercyffulle redempcion; and for the vysytacions that he sheweth to you cotydyally bothe in sparyng yow fro endeles peynes off helle, and yeveth yow space and grace and tyme to amende yeff ye wolle, for Cryst seyth Nolo mortem peccatoris sed ut magis conuertatur et viuat, that ys: 'I wylle nat the dethe of a synnere but rathere more that he turne therfro and lyue'.  Also he yeueth goodys plenteuosly that bene necessary and profytabely to yow, yef they be gouernede dyscretely; and so sheweth yow alle-wey grete tokenes off loue and mercy. Lefte spore.  The lefte spore ys dreede off paynes of helle and of purgatory that be Innumerable eyther to be thougth or seyd or tolde.  Now with thyse II sporys pryke youre horse yeff he be dulle and euylle-wylde to goodnes-warde. Furst with the ryghte spore that ys loue; and yeff he wolle nat haste hym in hys iorney, than pryke hyme with the lefte spore, that wylle make hym to sprynge yef he be in the wey off grace.  In thys manere, lyfe frendis, arme yow in thys gostly armure and myghteth yow in thys gostly batayle, and gouerne youre horse, that ys youre body, dyscretly, so that hit be nat ouer-feble by ouermeche abstynence and trauayle, ne to wylde by ouermoche ease and fulfyllyng of hys appetyte as in glotony or in lechery or in any other vngoodly desyres, for in case wykede lustes and desyres mowene be dedely synne, as thus: yeff thow luste to medle with womane or mane ayenst the lawe off gode and thow dost alle that lyeth in the to performe hitt in dede yeff thow myghtest, thane hit ys dedely synne.  Dauyd seyth that 'god knoweth and preueth mannes herte and hys leendys', that ys to sey, god knoweth mannes wylle and hys lustys, for there ys no thyng so pryuey neyther in thoughte ne in dede but that ys opyn in goddys syghte. Therfor suche as a mane ys in herte and in wylle, suche he ys by-fore gode. Also a wysemane, or he goo to batayle, wol knowe for what cause he shalle fyghte and whethere that hit be trewe, ande what shalle be hys rewarde; and yef hit be sygnede in two thyngis hym to chese, thane he wolle sende hys most belouede and trusty frende to see and enquere whyche ys best and most confortable.  In the same wyse muste ye in thys gostely batayle.  Ye muste fyghte to saue the soule that gode bougth so dere with hys precyous bloode vpone the rode-tree. Also hit ys rygthfulle, sythene god made the of noughte vn-to hys gloryous lykenesse and therto made the ffelaw with aungelys in blys that neuer shalle haue ende, that thow be fyghtyng ayenst thy gostely enemyes, and neuer to haue pease with heme\u2014for yeff thow doo, thou art traytoure to gode and lykely to lese thy herytage the whyche thow mayst haue by grace.  Also thy rewarde ys assygnede in two thyngis, to chese the best as longe as thou trauaylyng arte in thys batayle, but be thow onys hynnes went, thow mayst not do soo, for [to] whether so thov furst comest, lyke hit the welle or euylle, there the be-houeth to dwelle for euermore; shalt thow neuer after thys dwellyng chaunge, syt itt neuer so euylle with the.  Heuene and helle ben these two thyngis whyche thow mayst chese as\n\n \n\nlong as thow arte lyuyng, but [be] the soule onys departyde fro the body, than, whether thou lyke welle or euylle, nedys thou must kepe hit, and neuer after to be chaungyde; for thane, lyke as thou hast trauayled in the kepyng off goddis commaundementis and in the fulfyllyng off \u00fee dedys of mercy, so shalle thow be rewarded, that ys for to say: yeff thow hast kepte goddys commaundementis and fulfyllyde the dedys off mercy and with-stande thy enemyes myghtfully, than shalt thou haue the blysse of heuene and be ffelaw with aungellys euerlastyng; and yeff thow breke goddys commaundementis and wylle nat withstande the temptacions off thy enemyes but consentest to theme and performest in dede, ande wylle natt amende the by sorow in herte, by confessyone of mouthe, and by satysfaccion in dede, than shalle thy rewarde be endeles payne in helle withowtene ende. Wherfor my counselle ys that thow departe thy soule frome thy body by inwarde thoughte; and to sende thy herte, whyche ys [thy] most louyde and trusty frende, before, to wete off that two thyngis whyche ys moste profytable to abyde in.  Sende thyne herte in to helle and ther shalt thou fynde [all] that that thou ha[te]st here, that ys a fawte off alle goodys, and plente off alle euylles: hote ffyre brynnyng with-outyne lyghte, with brymstone moste stynkyng; foule stormes and tempestis; gredy deuylles as wode lyones wyde yellyng; hunger ande thryst that neuer shalle be quenchede; adders, toodys ande alle venemos wormes [\u00feat] one the synfulle shullene gnawe; wepyng, gronyng ande gryntyng off tethe; fulle off derkenes; smoke and smother, \u00feat shalle make hem to wepe mo teerys glowyng thane ys water in the see; eueryche hatyng other as the deuylle most horryble, and euer cursyng the tyme that they were borne, and euer desyryng dethe.  And so they be euer dying but neuer ffulle dede, but shul lyue euer in payne, woo and turment.  They hatedene dethe whane they lyuedene in lustis ande lykyngis of this worlde and fulfyllede here flesshly appetytys and wolde not restreyne hym by the brydylle off abstynence, in holdyng the reynes of temperaunce by the knotte off dyscrecion.  Also the soules that shalle be there must be dyrke ande dymme, hydously stynkyng and lothsome to see; for the bodyes off heme shulle be so febylle and so chargede with synne that they ne shalle [mow] remeve the lest worme frome no party off theyre body, but must suffre alle here malyce, and yet nat only heme, but alle the paynes, woo ande tormentis that herte may nat thynke ne tonge may nat telle, for they shal haue noo mynde off no goode to theyre comforte, but euer in payne lyche newe.  Ther ys ane olde prouerbe that, ne hope were, herte wolde breste; and ther shalle be neyther herte-breste ne hope off releuyng. O thow delycate creature tha[t] lyuest in wordely worschyppes and flesshly lustis in consentyng to the wykede intysyngis of thy enemyes: haue mynde how they shulle passe as the shadow, for thy body, be hit neuer so beauteuous and myghty, ande though thou kept hit neuer so welle with delycate metys and drynkes, with ryche clothes or eny other maner restorytyfys, yet hit shalle dye and turne ayene to erthe and wormes mete.  Also haue mynde off thy[s] place that ys so horryble and so paynfulle, and forsake syne whyles gode suffreth the to lyue ande hast helthe ande thy wyttes at wylle; for Salomone seyth: 'In alle thy werkes thynke one thy ende, ande thou shalt neuer doo syne'.  Thynke that thou shalt dye and thow wottest neuer where ne whene ne what dethe, ne in what state ne in what daye ne what tyme; ande therfore seyth seynt Austyn\u00af that euer shulde oure last day be in oure mynde, for whene \u00feou rysest thow arte nat sykere to [liue to euen, ne when thou gost to thi bed thou art nat syker to] ryse with thy lyfe.  Also haue mynde howe the sowle shalle departe frome the body with grete drede: for the fendys shulle be present and goode aungellis for to dyspute thy lyff fro the begynnyng to the ende, ande the goode aungellis shalle sey to the goode, ande the ffendys the wyckede, that noughte shalle be forgete to the leste thought that euer thou thowghtest other consentest to, ande alle the wordys that\n\n \n\neuer thow speke shullene be examynede, and alle thy dedys shewede.  And thane many synnes that thow may nat now see nor thynke, shalle than come be-fore the opynly ande perauenture more to drede ande more grysely thane thoo that thow may now see, and many thyngis [that] thow wenyst be now welle done shalle schew than fowle synne.  Moreouer haue mynde off the dredefulle day off dome: for than shalle oure lorde come and deme alle mankynde, as wytnesseth the prophete sayyng thus: Egredietur dominus de loco sancto suo ut uisitet iniquitatem habitatorum terre, 'Oure lorde shalle wende oute of hys place for to vysyte the wykednes of hem that inhabytene the erthe'.  Certes, thys day oweth sore to be dredde, for as moche mercy as oure lorde sheweth nowe to mankynde, so moche shalle thane be shewede streyte vengeable ryghtwysnes; for oure lorde seyth by hys prophete Moyes: Congregabo super eos mala et sagittas meas complebo in eis, 'I shal hepe vpone hem theyre euylles, and I shalle spende alle my arowes vpone heme'.  Thre sharpe arowes shalle be shotte off oure lorde in that day vpone hem that shullen be dampnede.  The furst arowe shalle be off clepyng to the dome, whereof Cryst seyth in the gospelle: Venit hora ut omnes qui in monumentis sunt audient uocem filii dei, & procedent hii qui bona egerunt in resurreccionem uite, qui uero mala egerunt in resurreccionem iudicii, that ys: 'the oure cometh in the whyche alle mene that bene deed in beryelles shulle here [the] voyce off goddys sone, and they that hane done goode thyngis shullene gone in to ayene-rysyng off lyff, but they that hane doo euylle thyngis in to ayene-rysyng off dome', that ys to say, to be demede.  Than the dampnable soule shalle come to the body and sey to hit: 'Aryse, thou cursyd caytyff [careyne], from thys tyme forwarde to be felaw with the horryble fendis in helle and enemy to almyghty gode.  Nowe thy ioye shalle be turnede in to woo, thy delyte in to bytternesse, and thy laughyng in to wepyng; now thy wrechyde lust shalle passe in to euerlastyng sorowe and peyne; nowe ys falle to the alle that thow hatedest, and nowe ys passyde fro the alle that thow loue[de]st.  Cursyde be thow wrecchyde careyne, for in payne for thy synnes and thy delytes and thy wykednes from the tyme that I passyde from the I haue brennede in helle; so cursyde be thow helle-bronde, ordeynede for thy synnes to the fyre off helle that neuer shalle be quenchede.  Cursede be the tyme that I was coupelede to the, for now I may nat forsake the nor thy cursyde company I may nat eschewe, for wylle I nylle I I am constreynede to be knytte ayene to the.  Goo we therfor to-gyder before the dredefulle and ryghtful iuge to here the sentence of oure dampnacion'.  Thane shullene alle wykede mene se the iust cause of theyre dampnacion wretyne with theyre owyne handes in the booke of theyre conscyence, whyche booke both lernede and lewde shullene kunne rede. Than they shalle see the domys-mane syttyng vpone the reyne-bowe with [his] voundys bledyng, and with sterne loke one hem lokyng as he were wode for wretthe.  Of thys wodnes [& wretthe] spekyth the profyte Dauyd where as he prayeth to be delyueryde of bothe, seying thus: Domine ne in furore tuo arguas me, that ys: 'Lorde, in thy wodenesse ouercome me nat with skyles, and chastyce me nat in thy wrathe'.  Nomane thynke that wodenes or wratthe or any suche troblede passyons of mannys kynde be in gode; but they be sette in scrypture for the werkes of gode in punysshyng and vengyng synne in hem that be worthy to take suche passyons off punysshyng as beene wrothe and wodnes in alle synners, that ys eyther they muste be chastysede by paynes that shalle haue ane ende as purgatory, that ys clepyde in scrypture the wratthe of gode, or ellys they shalle be punysshede in the payne off helle that neuer shalle haue ende, that ys callyde the wodnes of gode.  Alle thys the prophete Dauyd sawe in spyryte, and therfore in \u00fee persone off alle suche synners he, felyng hym-selfe vnmyghty to bere euer eythere, furst asketh to be delyueryd frome helle, and [sithen from] purgatorye, seying thus: Miserere mei domine quoniam infirmus sum, 'Lorde haue mercy one me, for I ame vnmyghty to bere euereyther, that ys to sey, \u00fein arguyng in thy\n\n\n \n\ndome, eyther thy chastyment in purgatory, but hit so be that I be vpborne or supportede by thy mercy'.  That dredeffulle day off oure lorde!  thane shalle wykede mene seene hem sytte in dome with Cryste whome they haddene [here] in despyte, and in thys syghte they shalle be troblede with ane horryble drede, saying thus: Hii sunt quos habuimus aliquando in derisum et similitudinem improperii; nos insensati uitam eorum  &c, that ys to say: 'Thyse beene tho the whyche [sumtyme] we haddyne in scorne and in to lykenesse [of] shenshypp.  We vnwytty wrecches heldyne ther lyffe wodenes, ande here ende with-owtene honoure: but loo now thyse beene amonge the sonnes off gode countede, and amonge the seyntis of gode ys the lote off theme.  Therfore we hane errede frome the wey off trewthe, and the lyghte off ryghtewysnes hath not shynede to vs, [and] the son of vnderstondyng is not spronge to vs]; we be made wery in the wey off wykednes and of perdycion, and we hane goone harde weyes, for the wey off gode we knewe nat.  What hat[h] pryde profyte vs? or the boste off rychesse what hath hitt brougth to vs? but [they] bene passyde as the shadowe.  And nowe we may shewe no tokyne off holynesse, for we bene wastyde in wykednesse'.  And amonge alle the multydude off seyntis they shullene fynde nat oone that shalle haue compassyone of hem, but [\u00feei] shullene be gladde and consent with gode in hys ryghte Iugement off here dampnacion.  Thys wytnesseth the profete Dauyd, seying thus: Letabitur iustus cum uiderit &c, that ys to sey: 'The ryghtwyse mane shalle be glade whene he shalle se vengeaunce'.  For the fadere that shalle be sauyde shalle ioye the dampnacion off hys sonne, the modere off the dowghter, the sone shalle ioye the dampnacion of hys modere, [the] doughter of the fadere.  For Cryst seyth they shulle seche for to entre in to creues of stonys and in to swolowes of the see, for fere off the syghte of the dredefulle face of Cryste; thane they [shul] prey mounteyns to falle opone theme, and hylles to hyde theyme.  So woo they shulle be one euery syde, for nothyng shalle res[ei]ue theyme but only helle.  And thys ys the vounde of the furst arowe. The secunde arowe shal be sharpe reprovyng of alle false crystene mene and womene, whene oure lorde shalle seye to hem thus: 'I was hungry ande ye gaff me no mete, I was thrysty and ye gaue [me] noo drynke, I was nakede and ye gaue me noo clothes, I was herborowles and ye herborowede me nat, I was seke [&] in presone ande ye vysyte me nat ne dyd me no comforte'.  O what thys voyce shalle be dredefulle, for as ofte as they dyden nat thyse dedis off mercy to the leste off hys that had nede, so oftyne they dyde hit nat to hyme.  And noo wondere [\u00feoff] thys voyce be dredefulle in the day off dome, sythene we redyne in the gospelle that whane Cryste came in the forme of a seruaunt to be demede of false Iewes, he sayde to hem that came to take hyme: 'I am he', [&] anone they yedyne abak and fellene to the erthe.  Thene, yeff he whene he was deedly and cam to be demyde had so ferefulle a voyce that att one worde dyde throwe to grounde so many mene of Iewes, how moche [more] ferefulle thane shall be the voyce of hyme whene [he] shalle come vndedely with hys oste off aungellys and off seyntys to deme the qwykke ande the dede lyke as they hane deseruede.  Wherfore Iob seyth: Cum vix paruam sintillam sermonum eius audire non possunt, tonitruum magnitudinis eius quis poterit intueri, 'Sythe mane vnnethes may here a lytylle drope of hys wordes suffre eyther beholde(!), how thane shulde they beholde the thundres of hys domes whene he shalle sytte as a ryghtfulle domesmane? as who seyth, noone.  And therfore seyth seynt Bernarde: 'When the synfulle wreche shal be accusede and hys owne conscyence shal bere wytnesse ayenst hym [& euery creature of god shal rise ayenst hym] in vengeaunce, thane greuous as ane arowe shalle be \u00fee voyce off gode to suffre'.  And therfore the profete Ieremye seyth: Sagitta vulnerans lingua eius, that ys: the tunge of hym shalle be as a arowe woundyng.  And thys ys the wounde of the secunde arowe. The thrydde arowe shalle be the sentence of endeles dampnacion of alle wykede mene, whene he shalle sey to heme thus: Discedite a me maledicti in ignem eternum qui preparatus [est] diabolo et angelis eius, that ys to sey: 'Departe ye frome me, cursyde and wrecchede, in to euerlastyng fyre, the whyche ys made redy to the deuylle and hys angelys'.  Thys arowe shalle wounde heme so grevously that alle the leches ne alle \u00fee creatures in erthe neyther in heuyne shulle mowe hele the wounde of hit.  Than shal the erthe opyne hys mowthe and swalowe hem doune in to helle, where they shalle be tormentyde with ffeendes withoutyne ende.  But allas, ther be, I drede, fulle many that wolle natt beleue thyse thyngis, tylle they felene heme; of whome seyth seynt Euseby: Ve ue quibus datum erit prius sentire quam credere, that is: 'Woo [woo] be to hem to whom hit shalle be youyn rather to fele thyse thyngis than to beleue heme'. Thys ys the wounde off the thrydde arowe. More-ouer sende thyne herte in to purgatory, that ys the free prysone off oure lorde gode to punyssh heme that were clene-shryvene off alle here synnes or they passyne owte off thys worlde, and hane nat perfourmede here penaunce here in thys lyff ne were nat fully clensyd as hem behouyth for to be.  In the whyche purgatory they shalle be purede with bytter peynes, and that paynes ys more harde to suffre eyther to fele than alle the paynes that euere martyres suffredene, ande more payne thane tunge cane reherse or telle.  Ther shalle thy soule be turment thorow ane hole yere for the penaunce that myght haue be done here in o day\u2014here-fore oure lorde seyth: Diem pro anno dedi tibi, that ys: 'I haue yeuene [the] a day for a yere'.  And trusteth for certeyne that that payne doth nat ellys but clenseth the soule frome syne; for the more ioye in heuene shalle he neuere purchase therby for that peyne sufferyng, though he were there from the begynnyng off thys worlde in to the day of dome.  But the payne that thou suffrest here with meke herte, thynkyng that thoue art worthy hit and moche more for the grete trespaces and vnkyndenes that thou euery day dost ayenst oure lorde gode, shalle bothe helpe to clense thy soule, and to encrese thy blysse in heuene. Also haue mynde of .VII. paynes that thy soule shalle haue.  The furst shalle be whane thy body ande thy soule shalle parte; for thane shullene the fendys appere in theyr lykenesse to rauyssh the soule in to helle with grysely chere, with chalangis ande thretenyngis as hit were theyre ryghte to haue hit, and so to brynge hit in to dyspeyre yeff they mowene. The seconde peyne ys thys: the grete drede that the soule shalle haue tylle the Iugement be endyde be-twene the aungelles ande the ffendis; for lyke as a mane beyng in grete tempestis on the see hath grete drede of drenchyng, so the soule heryng the grete and horryble synnes that he hath done rehersyde be the fende, stondeth in grete fere for to be dronchede in the fyre of helle; for though the soule haue ryghte be-leue ande ryghte trusty hope to be sauyde, yet oure lorde suffreth hit to haue the drede, for to clense hit frome synne. The III de ys exylyng; for the soule ys exylyde oute off thys lyfe, from hys frendis, and from hys herytage\u2014whyche ys paradyse\u2014thorowgh syne; the whyche they shullene neuer be restorede to, vn-to the tyme that hit be purede and claryfyede as clene as hit was att the day off bapteme; for seynt Austyne seyth: 'lyke as golde ys purede and claryfyede be fyre here, ryghte so shale the soule be purede ande claryfyede by the fyre there'.  And loke, howe moch here the fyre ys hotere thane the sone-beame, so moche ys the fyre off purgatory more hote thane the fyre here; and loke, what peyne hit were to suffre any parte off the body to brynne in the fyre here, so moche peyne ande more hit ys to the soule to be in [the] fyre there; for seynt Ancelme seyth that the fyre off purgatory ys\n\n \n\noff so moche myghte and so kene, that as longe as hit ffyndeth aughte in the soule that toucheth [to] synne, hit stynteth neuer. The fourthe payne ys that the soule ys boundyne with bondys off synne, that hit may nat helpe hit-selfe but nedys muste suffre, to the bondys be wasted; for lyke as a mane boundene muste suffre the malyce off hys enemyes, ryghte so the soule muste suffre the peynes tylle hit be purede. The fyfte payne ys the sekenesse that the soule shalle be greuede with; for lyke as a mane boundene muste suffre the malyce off hys enemyes, ryghte so the soule muste suffre the peynes tylle hit be purede. The fyfte payne ys the sekenesse that the soule shalle be greuede with; for [The sixt payne is that the soulis bene there as in dissert, where defaute is of alle gode, and plenty of alle eville.] The seuenth payne ys the grete colde that they shullene be caste in after the feruent hete, for sodaynly oute off the brynnyng fyrre they shalle be caste in a lycoure that ys caldere thane any Ise or snowe; and oute of that colde sodaynly they [shal] be caste ayen in to feruent hete; ande so to be paynede with paynes innumerable, tylle oure lorde off hys endeles mercy wylle graunte heme grace off delyueraunce, and so to come to the endeles blysse that mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion.  Now whane thou hast welle examynede what peyne ys in purgatory for penaunce that ys nat done in thys lyfe, and for venyalle synnes that he was natt shryvene off neyther made [a]sythe for heme in noone other waye:  be ware thane that thou delay nat from day to day to do penaunce, neyther be recheles in doyng, ne sory to do hit, but do hit with grete mekenesse and gladnesse off herte, hauyng mynde what peyne thow were worthy to suffre for thy trespasse that thou dost custumablye ayenst thy makere, thyne ayenebeyere, and thy mercyffulle sparere, and [\u00feat] therto foryeueth the thy peynes of purgatory for so lytelle penaunce doyng with meke herte.  More-ouer be ware off venyalle synnes: for hit ffareth therby as hit doth by a shyppe that hath a lytelle hole in the botome, in the whyche hole yeff the water entere, though hit be but lytelle and lytelle, yet by processe off tyme hit may drenche the shyppe, but hit be caste owte.  So, venyalle synnes so many there mowene be that yeff they be nat caste [oute] by sorowe of herte, by prayere ande by allemos-dede doyng, [they] may drenche the soule in to endeles paynes of helle as a dedely synne may doo. Sythyne than that almyghty gode ys dyspleasede and dyshonowrede by venyalle synnes, that be callede smale synnes, how moche more thane ys he dyshonourede and dysplesyde with dedely synnes?  and sythyne euery venyalle syne ys so grete in goddys syghte, how meche more than ys dedely synne?  Therfore haue mynde on thy trespas that thou hast done ayenst gode bothe in worde ande in thougth, in delytyng ande consentyng, in desyryng ande in dede-doyng, and euer with meke herte ande with conpunccion of teeres aske foryeuenes; and therto make satysfaccion to thyne euynecrystene off alle the trespasses that thou hast done ayenst hyme as fer forth as thy goodys wolle strecche; ande yeff thy goode wolle nat suffyse, thane behoueth the to aske foryeuenesse; and yeff thow may not come to the partyes eyther for febylnes or ellys that they be dede, thane be in wylle to aske foryeuenes, and pray for hem; so that thou mayst escape thyse peynes off helle, and the sonnere be delyueryd owte off the peynes off purgatory thorowe the endeles mercy off oure lorde gode.  For alle tho that bene quykenyde with the gracyous illuminacion of the holy gost, dredyne thyse two placys, that ys, helle ande purgatory,\n\n\n \n\nand so kepe[n] hem with alle theyre mygth from alle maner off synnes.  [But] for the kynde off mannys flessh ys so freelle ande so inclynyng to synne that no day passyth  withowtene synne eyther more or lesse:  therfor oure forme-ffaders that werene in grace and knewene the[r] freelnes, lyuedene in mornyng, and ofte for-thynkyng in herte with ffastyng and almes-dedys, with prayere ande grete wepyngys, sorowdene for her synnes, thorow the whych they were clensyde and caste oute off the soule.  Also som mene that hane bene before, sore defoulede with dedely synnes and with venyalle Innumerable, oftyne-tymes for drede to offende god more, and also to haue [grace &] foryeuenesse of the [synnes] before-doone, and to fle frome thyse two places that bene so paynefulle, hane forsake alle the worlde, bothe the[r] goodis and also the presence off people\u2014for the ey off mane ys a grete occasyone to syne and thane cometh speche off mowthe, and so ofte-sythes fulfyllede in dede; wherfor they seing ther freelnes, fleddene in to deserte places, to lerne to loue oure lorde Ihesu Cryste, and there they wayledene theyre synnes before-done and therto continuelly lyfedene in prayere and in abstynence with bodyly werkes, in chastysyng the body from wykydnes; and also hauyng compassyone off theyre euene-crystene, seyng the grete torment that they were yne bothe in getyng off worldely goodes and worldely worschyppys and flesshly lustys and so lyuedene as vnresonable bestis hauyng noo mynde that they shulle dyene neythere that they shalle come ande be demede in the dredefulle day off dome, but contynuede in theyre malyce ande in wykydnes as they shulde neuer dye, or ellys wenyng that [god] ys so mercyfulle that he wylle natt punyssh synners. Now sende thy herte in to heuyne, to wyte how it ys there.  And ther shalt thow fynde plente off alle goodys, for there ys no maner of peyne but euer-[ich] in ioye and lykyng in helthe, and so euer fyllede with alle maner off ioye and swetnesse. For there ys al maner off melody with songe of angelles brygth, and therto sekernesse of euerlastyng blysse that neuer shalle haue ende.  Also mannys body shalle be brytere thene the sonne whene hit shyneth brygthest, and shalle haue more sw[ift]nesse then alle erthely creatures mow deuyse, and her thoughtis, her wylles and her desyres shal be fulfyllyde in the twynkelyng of ane eye.  No thyng shal be there but alle goodnes and comforte; nouther no thyng shalle withstande heme, for they shalle be so myghty that they shalle mowe passe al hylles and valeys, and so to be frome the one ende off the worlde to the othere in as breeff tyme as hit may be thoughte.  For thowgh they were so febylle here, there they shullene be so lyghte, so lusty, so beauteuouse, ande so fulfyllede with ioye, that nothyng shalle withstande theyme that ys contrary to theyre wylle.  For they shulle haue ffulle knowyng of alle thyngis that euer were doone or shalle be doone, for they shulle haue fulle knowyng of the trynyte, the myghte of the fadere, the wysedome of the sone, the goodnes of the holy gost; for in the syght of the gloryous face of oure lorde gode they shullene [se] alle that may be seene off any creature; for as seynt Austyn\u00af seyth, they shulle see hyme both gode and mane, and they shalle see hem-self in hym, and alle other thyngis more and lesse\u2014for alle thyngis that nowe be hidde, shulle thene be opyne both in syghte ande knowyng.  Ande so they shalle be fulfyllede in theyre .v. wyttes with alle maner of ioye; for lyke as a vesselle that ys dyppyde in the water ys wete bothe with-inne & with-oute, aboue ande benethe ande on euery syde, and nomore lykore may resceyue for fulnesse, ryghte so shulle they that shalle be sauyde be fulfyllede with ioye and blys with-outen ende.  Also they shullene haue endeles lyffe in the syghte of the holy trinite, and thys ioye shalle passe alle other ioyes, for they shalle be in ful sekyrnes that they shullene neuer fayle off that excellent ioye.  Also they shullene haue parfyte loue to-geder, for eche off heme shalle accorde to odyr wylle; that he that ys in the leste ioye shalbe as ioyfulle of hyme that ys in the hyghest ioye,\n\n\n \n\nas though he were there in the same ioye.  And so the ioyes of that gloryous blysse may noo herte thynke nor tonge reherse; ffor though alle the ioyes that alle erthely creatures couthe deuyse myghte be comprehendyde in oo ioye, yet were hit nat in comparysone to the lest ioye that ys in that gloryous blysse.  For the ioyes that bene there be so delycate, so comfortable and so fulle off swetnesse that they myghte dey for ioye, but \u00feat god preseruyth hem fro deth as thoo that be in [the] horryble pytte off helle & stynkynge paynes myghtene dyene for payne and tormentis the whyche [they] musten suffre, but that gode preserueth theym fro dethe.  For oure lorde wolle that thoo \u00feat hane kepte hys commaundementis and hane submyttyde hem to hys lawes, to lyue in blysse with-outene ende; and there-ayens tho that wylle nat obeye to hys lawes neyther kepe hys commaundementis, that they shalle lyue in payne with-outyne ende. \u2014 Thys ys the ryghte spore that shalle haste hem to loue oure lorde in vertewe [of] goodnes, ande to hate synne for fere of peyne(!).  For yeff a creature myghte fele the lest drope off the leste ioye whyche ys in that blysse, [he] shulde fele lytylle payne or ellys noone thowgh alle the peynes that euer were in erthe or shullene be, myghte be putte to hyme; for the grete loue [\u00feat] suche a soule shulde haue to gode, and \u00fee grete desyre that hit shulde haue to that endeles blysse, shulde so rauyssch the soule that hit [shuld] fele noo paynes that myghte be putte therto; neyther hit shulde haue no ioye of noone erthely goodys neyther off worldely worshyppys, but rather noying thane plesyng therto.  Thys loue steryth a mane more be a thowsandefolde thane done the peynes of helle eyther of purgatory, to lyue vertously; ffor loue perysshyth and putteth oute drede, and clenseth the soule fro synne, and maketh hit to see gode thorough gostly thoughtis, thorow gostly redyngis of holy wrytte, and thorow gostly and holy prayers, and to sty to heuynly desyres.  But I drede ther be many [\u00feat] farene as a chylde that ys borne in a depe prysone whyche ys bothe stynkyng and horryble to see.  The moder, knowyng the wellefare that she hadde owte of prysone, ys in moche sorowe and care ande heuynesse, desyryng with alle her myghte to be oute of prysone ayene in hyr welfare:  but the chylde borne in myscheff of the prysone, ande neuer hade better knowyng of welfare, yeueth lytelle tayle to that myscheff in the prysone, for as longe as he hath hys moder with hyme and hys sustenaunce thowgh hit be but ffebylle, he maketh neyther sorowe ne care, for he longeth after no better fare, for he knoweth no better; for though hys moder telle hyme off the ioye ande off the welffare that ys oute off prisone, off the sone ande off the mone eyther off the sterres, or off the fayre floures spryngyng opone the erthe, or of the byrdys syngyng, off myrthe, of melody, or of ryche aray of lordys, of ladyes, and of welthes owte of prisone the whyche she was wonte to haue, yet alle hyr tale ys but a dreme to the chylde, for he leueth hit nat and therfor he longeth nat ther-after, and wylle nat for alle that blysse and welfare that she spekyth of forsake hys moder ne hys febylle fare that he hath with hyr; and that ys for he leueth hit nat.  Ande yet hit ys as \u00fee modere seyth.  But were the chylde onys owte off prysone, and se the myrthe, welthe ande welfare that she spake off, he wolde be fulle sory to go ayene in to prysone there to lyfe with hys modere; ffor alle hys lyf in prisone, whyche was furst lykyng Inowgh to hym, shalle thane be to hyme fulle bytter and paynfulle, and therto he shulde neuer haue ioye ne reste in herte tylle he were ageyn in that welffare whyche he sawe oute of prisone.  Ryghte so this folk of thys worlde borne and browgth forth in sorowe and care and moche trauayle in thys wrecchede worlde that ys foule and stynkyng as a prisone; for they hane so moche loue and lykyng one theyre erthely moder ande of theyre company, that ys to say one erthely thyngis, that they hane no lykyng in heuynly thyngis ne longyn nat ther-after; for though\n\n\n \n\nher gostly moder, holy chyrche, ande her gostely ffader gode hym-self, fader off alle, telle hem the blysse ande the wellfare whyche ys in the blysse off heuyne, hit ys to theyme but a dreme as the tale off the moder ys to the chylde in prysone, that they hane noo sade feyth theryne.  And tryste itt fully, though they beleue nat that hit ys so as oure moder holy chyrche tellyth, howe ther ys in this worlde but stynke ande horrybylyte and a foule dongeone in comparysone of that heuynly blysse, yet hit ys so as her gostly fader seyth, ande nat the lese for her mysbeleue.  Neuer-the-lese take hit for certeyne that they shalle neuer haue parte neyther ffelyng of that blysse, but they wol beleue ande trust fully that hit ys so as theyre modere holy chyrche telleth.  Wherfore withdrawe youre hertis from erthely thyngis and sette [not] youre loue to moche one youre erthely moder, ne truste her nat, for though she speke neuer so fayre and behote yow neuer so welle, she ys false ande wolle dysceyue yow at the last.  For she fareth as the nykare or meremaydene, that cast opone the water syde dyuerse thyngis whyche semene fayre and gloryous to mane, but anone as he taketh hit ande weneth to be sure theroff, anone she taketh hyme ande deuoureth hym.  Ryghte so thyne erthely moder casteth oute fayre ande gloryous thyngis to thy syghte, she casteth oute grete rychesse and worldely goodys ande worshyppes ande flesshly lustis, whyche bene fastnede to the rope off hope of longe lyff, and assone as thow towchest heme, that ys to say as sone as thow desyrest heme and laborest with alle thy myghte, with alle thyne herte and with alle thyne thoughtis to haue heme, anone she draweth the rope off longe lyfe, that ys, she seyth 'thow arte yonge and may lyue longe, ande therfor laboure to haue goodys ande gete the worschypp, that thow mayst lyue esyly in thyne age.  And thow lyue in lechery, in glotony, in pryde, in extorsyone or in any wrongfulle takynge, whene thou comest to age than shalt thow mowe doo grete almes, and so by prayers off pore men shalt thow haue foryeuenesse'; and so thorow hope off longe lyfe ande of other mennes prayers thowh thou lyue stylle in synne, [she] wylle take ande deuoure the in the fyre off helle.  And therfor trust her nat; but set thy trust, thyne hope, thyne loue in thy gostly moder that ys to beauteuouse and trust[i] to be-leue opone hyr, for she seyth nowthere behotyth but that shalle be performede, yeff thou wolt obey to here byddyngis.  For yeff thou haddest felt ore seyne the lest blysse that ys in heuyne, thene alle the ioyes and lykyngis that thow hast in thys worlde of erthely thyngis, shalle thane be to the grete bytternes, sorowe ande care.  Example haue we off seynt Petyr whom Cryst ladde opone the hylle off Thabor with Iohne ande Iames, and ther he schewede but a lytylle off [the] blysse of hys manhode, whyche was hys face shynyng as the sonne, hys clothys were whyte as snowe, ande Moyses ande Helyas apperede with hyme in grete blysse ande in grete mageste.  Than Petyr seyde vnto oure lorde Ihesu: Lorde, hit ys good to vs to be here, and make we thre tabernacles, on to the, another to Moyses, and another to Hely, and late us allewey dwelle here', and so anone in the syghte of that lytelle blys in comparysone off the blys that ys in heuyne, he forgatte alle the blysse off thys worlde, for he carede neythere for mete ne drynke ne for clothyng; hym thoughte he myghte haue lyuede there withoutyne ende by that blysfulle syghte, Luc. 9o.  Also seynt Powle was rauysshede in to heuene ande hade seene the vysyons and the pryuytees off gode; afterwarde alle hys lyfe in thys worlde was to hyme a peyne, so moche he longede agayne to that blysse:  wherfore he seyde: Infelix ego homo sum, quis me liberabit de corpore [mortis] huius, that ys:  '[I] vnsely mane, who shalle delyuer me from the body [of this deth?  I covett to be departid the soule from the body] and to be with Cryste withoutyne ende?'  Moyes was with gode in the mount of Synay fourty dayes and fourty nyghtes meteles ande drynkles, fedde be the presence and the speche of gode; and yet sawe he but lytelle off hys blysse.  Sythene than Petyr, Powle,\n\n\n \n\nand Moyses werene fulfyllede and myght haue lyfede withoutene ende in the syghte off that lytelle blysse, moche more thene after the day of dome alle tho that shullene be sauyde and go to blysse bothe body and soule, shullene be fulfyllede with ioye, blysse and comforte whyche neuer shalle haue ende. Now, brother or syster that heryst or redest thys sympylle wrytyng, take hede off thy horse, whyche ys thy body, that he be made buxome and mylde vnto the soule whyche ys hys master.  Also take hede that the soule be welle armede with gostly armour, whyche beene vertewes, and that the spere, [the] swerde, and the shelde be nat lefte be-hynde; and haue mynde off thyne rewarde whyche ys putte in thyne eleccione.  Thynke what blysse thow mayst haue, yeff thow wolt trauayle and quyte the as a trewe knyghte in thys gostly batayle; and ther-ayens what peyne, woo and tormentys thow shalt haue in fyre off helle, yeff thow be a cowarde and wylle nat fyghte ayenst thy gostly enemyes but consentest to there wykede counsellys and wylle nat obey to goddys commaundementis and to hys lawe.  Also be ware off thy erthely moder that she dysseue the nat; but trust in thy gostly moder, for she ys trew ande trusty to truste vpone and to be-leue vpone; and yeff thou doo thus, thane shalle thow come to endeles blysse whyche man was ordeynede to in hys furst creacione, amen.

For \u00fee bisy vnderstondyng of this sentence is distruccion of pruyde, quenchyng of enuye, medicyne of malice, dryuyng awey of licherie, voidyng of boost and of vanytee, informacion of leernyng, perfeccion of hoolynesse,\n\n\n \n\nand reparaylyng of euerlastynge heelthe, and \u00feerfore the prophete pleinyng oure greete blyndenesse, preieth with pitee seiynge thus:  Wolde god \u00feat men sauouredyn and vnderstooden and purueiedyn for the laste \u00feinges!

Be-hold now, freend, how profitable a myrour it is for synneres, the inwardly biholdyng of this highe sentence, that is:  Wolde god \u00feat men sauouredyn and vnderstonde, and purueieden for the laste thynges!

Wepynge \u00feow koome in to this wrecchednesse, with teene and traueil \u00feow hast endured thi dayes, and with sorwe & woo \u00feow schalt passe hennes.  Vnderstond \u00feerfore how wooful is \u00fein entree, how chaungeable is thy lyuynge heere, & how feerful is thy passyng awey. Ande passyng al this vnderstonde, i. prey \u00feee, that in this vaale of weepyng \u00feow art bothe seeke and an outlawe, ful poore in vertues, fful vnstable in thy lyuyng, and happily thow schalt not abide til to-morwe.  Oo brother, ful wel schal \u00feee bee &yogh;ef \u00feowe sauoure & vnderstonde thise thynges \u00feat i. telle \u00feee, and &yogh;ef \u00feow wolt write hem in thyn herte as in a book; & namely &yogh;ef thow bisye the to keepe in thy mynde thise two versis next folwynge: Viue deo gratus, mundo toto tumulatus, Crimine mundatus, semper transire paratus, that is:  'Lyue thankful to thi god, buried al to the world, Maad al cleene of synne, & reedy euer to goon henne'. Lo nowe, my deere brother, now hast \u00feow i-seye in this myrour what \u00feow schalt sauoure, and what thow schalt vnderstonde.  \u00b6 But now as for the thridde, lat\n\n\n \n\nsee what \u00feow schalt purueye:  preynge thus with the prophete: Notum fac michi domine finem meum, et numerum dierum meorum quis est, ut sciam quid desit michi, that is:  'Lord, make myn eende i.-knowe to me, & which is the noumbre of my dayes, that i. may knowe what me fayleth'.  O \u00feat profitable preyer, \u00feat heelful contemplacioun, and \u00feat necessarie askynge of god; nou&yogh;t for to coueite to knowe bifore tymes & momentis, the whiche the fader of heuene hath sette in his owen power, but \u00feat \u00feow knowe and vnderstonde that \u00feow art but an outlawe, a gest, and a pilgrym heer in this wrecchide lyf, a freel man and a feble, and luytel while abydyng vpon \u00feis eerthe.  For &yogh;ef \u00feow biholde wel to the schortnesse of this lyf, and seest how the lakketh sufficeaunt tyme to fulfille inne penaunce for thy synnes in trew keepyng of the heestis of god and in encresyng of thi perfeccion, \u00feow schuldest bothe sauoure and vnderstonde; and &yogh;ef \u00feow wolt sette the sodeynte of deeth bifore \u00fee ei&yogh;en of \u00fei mynde, doutelees \u00feow schuldest \u00feanne withouten lette dispise al \u00fee boost of \u00feis lyf, \u00fee bisynesse of worldly vanytee, & alle \u00fee lustes \u00feat longen to the flesch, and sette wise & waar kepynge of thi wittes, and bisily purueye \u00feee for the laste thynges.  For alle wise men awaiten as bisily to the eende of euery thyng, as to the bigynnyng, and rathere moore; & verreily he is proeued for wise, that so wel \u00feenketh of rekenyng bifore rekenyng, \u00feat he may after in tyme of rekenyng eschewe peril of rekenyng. \u00b6 But now perauenture \u00feow seist to me thus:  'Sire, i am al reedy to doo after the counseil of god, \u00feat i. may sauoure & vnderstonde & purueye for the laste thynges: but whiche been my laste thynges that \u00feow spekest of?'  Soothly thei been thoo the whiche \u00fee holy goost spekith of to \u00feee by Salomon, seiynge thus: Fili, in omnibus memorare nouissima, et ineternum non peccabis, \u00feat is:  'Sone, in alle thynges haue in mynde thy laste thynges and \u00feow schalt not synne with-outen eende'.  He synneth with-outen eende, that deserueth peyne withouten eende; the which synne and peyne a man may redilokest eschewe by contynuel thenkynges of his laste thynges, as it is schewed by thise verses that folwen: Non melius poterit caro luxuriosa domari, Mortua qualis erit quam semper premeditari, that is:  'A lecherous flesch may no better be temed, than euere to thenke byfore what it schal be after \u00feat it is deed'.  And therfore ful blessed schalt \u00feow be &yogh;ef \u00feou holde with contynuaunce this holy bithenkyng of thi laste thynges. 'But whiche been \u00feise laste thynges for the whiche men schulden purueie?' Sykerly thei been tho thynges that schullen falle to \u00feee in that feerful hour of thi deeth, whan \u00fei wrecchede soule schal passe out of thi careful body dredyng and quakyng.  For trust it wel \u00feat in \u00feat dreedful hour \u00feee were leuer to haue the freendschip of god, \u00fean alle the lordschipes of the world.  For whiche of thi freendis \u00feou&yogh; thei comen with swerdis & armes, with oostis of poeple or with mylions of goold, mowe in \u00feat laste grisly and dreedful hour doo \u00feee eny comfort or help?  Sothly, \u00feeer schal noon mowe comforte the of alle \u00feat \u00feow now loueste cleerly without a cleene conscience of thyn owene, \u00feough \u00feow loke to be holpyn of men; for refut schal \u00feeer noon bee \u00feanne, but at god al-one.  Thenk \u00feerfore by the self, i. prey \u00feee, with what dreed he schulde be dred, with what loue he schulde be loued, and with what honour he schulde be worschiped, oure lord & oure god verrey Crist Ihesu, the whiche oonly by hym-self is my&yogh;ty to do vs refut after oure deth.  And \u00feerfore bryng it ofte to thi mynde, that dreedful day of thy passynge, and eer thi wrecched soule departe fro the prison of thi flesch, let it purueye whider it may goo.  Worche \u00feerfore nowe suche thynges that mowen bothe helpe & spede \u00feee in \u00feat way, and leeue \u00feilke thynges \u00feat mowen lette \u00feee.  \u00b6 In this maner of thenkynge the soule conceyueth forthenkynge, fforthenkyng bryngeth forth confessioun, and confession norisscheth amendynge and ful asseth makyng, and alle thise togidere engendryn in a man verrey hope strecchyng in to god, and parfit meeknesse in a man self.  For what thyng is in eny mannes wit \u00feat sonner meeuyth a man to mekenesse, to kepyng of hym-self fro vanytee, to voydynge of vnri&yogh;twisnesse, & to perfeccioun of holynesse, than\n\n \n\ndoth the consideracioun of a mannes corrupcioun and hys freelte, of his deedlynesse, and of the dreedful day of his deeth?  For whan a man bigynneth to wex seek & his seeknesse groweth, \u00fee conscience dreedith, \u00fee herte quaketh, the heed stoupeth, the wyttes waasten, his strengthe faileth, the visage wexeth paale, the tunge engleymeth, the teeth stynkyn, the speche wexeth thynne, the breeth gooth awey, the body croketh, the flesch widerith, and alle the beaute is turned in to filthe and corrupcioun; whan the body is buried, it falleth in to powdir, & is turned alle in to wormes.  Bihold now, brother, this is an horrible si&yogh;t; but it is a [ful] profitable myrour.  O ful happy is he \u00feat bisily biholdeth hym-self in this myrour:  ffor \u00feeer is no craft, medicyne, ne techyng, \u00feat so soone distruyeth vice, & plaunteth vertewes, as doth \u00fee inwardly biholdyng thus of a mannes laste thynges.  And \u00feerfore, wolde god \u00feat men sauouredyn & vnderstoden, and purueiedyn for the laste thynges!  \u00b6 For what thyng, after \u00feat it is deed, waxeth so vyl as a man?  For the flesch of a man is moore vyl than the skyn of a schepe.  For though a schepe dye, sum profit cometh \u00feeerof:  the skyn is take fro the flesch, and on it men writen in both sydes; and whan a man dieth, alle dieth with hym the flesch, \u00fee skyn & \u00fee boones.  Be a-schamed, \u00feow proude man, bee aschamed!  thow \u00feat hast moore likynge to leerne & to reede on the bokes of vanytees than on the bookes of holy writ!  &YOGH;it be a-schamed, & heere what the prophete seith to \u00feee and to alle suche in his psalme: Apprehendite disciplinam, ne quando irascatur dominus et pereatis de via iusta, that is:  'Take &yogh;e techyng of amendement of maneres, lest oure lord bee agreued and &yogh;e perissche fro the ri&yogh;te way'. O how feerful a sentence is this, and howe muche to be drad!  ffor it is openly schewed be this sentence, that alle \u00feoo schullen perisshe that taakyn not this heelful techyng of amendement.  And therfore oure lord seith \u00feus by Moyses his prophete: Omnis anima que non fuerit afflicta die hac, peribit de populo meo, that is:  'Euery soule schal perisshe \u00feat chastiseth not it-self' by hertly forthynkyng and laweful amendement of his maneres, 'this day', that is to seye:  in this present lyf, whan the li&yogh;t of grace & of mercy schynyth openly, take it who take wole; ffor who so wol not now taake tyme of forthynkyng, schal after hys deeth haue no place of for&yogh;euyng.  And \u00feerfore be soore a-dred \u00feow wrecched chaityf synner, \u00feow proude flesch, thow vile careyne, bee soore a-dred!  \u00feow wrecche, bee a-dred!  Cast awey thi pruyde, fflee fro vanytee, and taak to the this heelful techyng of amendement, lest \u00feow perissche.  Be-hold in this myrour and see what \u00feow hast been, what \u00feou art, and what thow schalt bee.  \u00b6 Thenk of how vile a mater \u00feow woxe vp in thy modris wombe, how vyl al thyng is whan it passeth fro thee, be it neuer so deynteuous whan thow receyuest it; and last of alle, bihold how vile wormes mete \u00feow schalt be lyggyng in thy graue.  Bihold now, \u00feow wrecche, what mateer \u00feow hast of sorwe moore than of ioye, what mater of meeknesse moore \u00fean of pruyde.  And what so euer \u00feat fooles doon, loke euer \u00feat \u00feou be munnyng of thy-self:  Let the world wexe vil to \u00feee, eer thou be vil to hit.  And ouer al \u00feis bihold in this myrour how \u00feat in the laste horrible & dreedful houre, whan thi wrecchide soule schalle passe fro thi body, anoon \u00feeer schullen be reedy & present a greet & an horrible multitude of wykked spirites, mynistres of the foule feend of helle, ri&yogh;t as it weeren as meny lyouns rorynge for to chase thy soule as for here pray.  \u00b6 Thanne sodeynly \u00feeere schullen appeere ful horrible plases of peyne and of derkenesse, Places of drede and of quakynge, Places of gryndynge of teeth & of wepynge.  Theer schal bee fretynge of wormes, and the hidous noyse of punysschede soules cryengge:  'Woo!  Woo! Woo be to vs, \u00fee synful wrecchede sones of Eue'!  And whan alle thise thynges and oother moo lyk to \u00feise, &yogh;ee and a \u00feowsand-foold worse thynges \u00feen mowen be spoken, [ben] i-herd, i-seye and felt of the wrecchid soule passynge out of the caareful body:  how grysely and how muche dreed, feerdnesse & tremblynge schal thanne be in it, the whiche tunge may not telle.  \u00b6 But no[w] i. aske of thee, seyenge thus:  \u00b6 What schal it thanne profite to \u00fee al thy boost of kunnynge,\n\n \n\n\u00fee pompe of the poeple, the vanytee of the world, and al the dignytee of worldly couetise?

Thanne \u00fee wrecched dampned soule schal come to \u00fee body, and seye to hit:  'Aryse \u00feow curside caityf careyne, fro \u00feis tyme forth withouten eny eende to be felow to \u00fee deuel, and enemy to al-my&yogh;ty god.

O that dreedful day of oure lord!  \u00deanne schullen alle wykked men see hem sitte in \u00fee doom with Crist, whom \u00feei haue heere dispised; and in \u00feis sight been troubled with an horrible dreede, seyenge \u00fee woorde of \u00fee wise man: Hii sunt quos aliquando habuimus in derisum &c.  Nos insensati &c., \u00feat is:  'Thise been \u00feoo \u00fee whiche sum tyme we hadden in scorn and despit.

Thanne amonges al \u00feat multitude \u00feei schullen not fynde oon \u00feat schal haue compassion of hem, but alle schullen bee glaade & consent with god in here iuste dampnacion, after \u00fee woordes of \u00fee psalme seienge \u00feus: Letabitur iustus cum viderit vindictam, \u00feat is:  'The ri&yogh;twis man schal be gladed whan he schal see \u00fee vengeaunce'.

Thanne schullen \u00feei preie monteynes to falle vpon hem, and hulles to huyden hem, so woo \u00feei schullen be on euery syde. And \u00feis is \u00fee wounde of \u00fee firste arwe.  The secounde arwe schal be an arwe of scharp repreuyng of alle fals cristene men, whan he schal seie to hem \u00feus: 'I was an-hungred, and &yogh;e &yogh;eue me noo mete; I was a-\u00feurst and &yogh;e &yogh;eue me no drynke; I was naked and &yogh;e &yogh;eue me noon herbere; I was seek and in prison\n\n\n \n\nand &yogh;e visyted me not ne dede me no comfort'.

And no wonder \u00feou&yogh; \u00feis voys schal bee dreedfulle in \u00fee day of doom, sitthe we reden in \u00fee gospel \u00feat Crist, whan he koom in fourme of a seruaunt for to bee deemed of \u00fee false Iewes, seide to hem \u00feat sou&yogh;ten for to take hym:  'I am he':  and anoon \u00feei &yogh;eeden abak and fellen to \u00fee eerthe.  &yogh;ef he \u00feat whan he was deedly and koom to be demed, hadde so feerdful a voys, \u00feat with his oo woord \u00ferew&yogh; to \u00fee grounde so meny steerne men of \u00fee Iewys, a fer moore feerdful voys schal he haue whan he schal come vndeedly with his oost of aungelis & of seyntes for to deeme \u00fee quyke and \u00fee deede, euery man after \u00feat he hath deserued.  And \u00feerfore seith Iob: Cum vix paruam stillam sermonum eius audire non possunt, tonitruum magnitudinis eius quis potest sustinere? \u00feat is:  'Sitthe man may vnneethes heere a luytel drope of his woordes, \u00fee greete \u00feunder of his doom who schalle mowe suffre?  As who seith noone.  And \u00feerfore seith seynt Bernard \u00feus: Cum peccator accusatus fuerit & consciencia propria contra eum testimonium perhibuerit et omnis creatura dei insurrexerit contra eum in vindictam, grauis vt sagitta erit vox domini ad sustinendum, \u00feat is:  'Whanne \u00fee synful kaityf schal be accused, & his owene conscience schal bere witnesse a&yogh;ens him, and euery creature of god schal ryse a&yogh;ens him in vengeaunce: greuous as an arwe schal \u00feanne be \u00fee voys of god to suffre'.  And \u00fee prophete Ieremie seith: Sagitta vulnerans lingua eius, \u00feat is:  'The tunge of him schal be as an arwe woundynge'.   And \u00feis is \u00fee secounde arwe.  The \u00feridde arwe schal bee an arwe of eendelees dampnyng of alle wykkede men, whan he schal seie to hem: Ite maledicti in ignem eternum qui preparatus est diabolo & angelis eius, \u00feat is:  'Goo &yogh;e cursede wi&yogh;tes in to euerlastynge fuyre, \u00fee whiche is ordeyned to \u00fee feend and to \u00fee aungelis of him'.  This arwe schal wounde hem \u00feat it falleth on so greuously, \u00feat alle \u00fee lechis, phisiciens & surgiens, ne &yogh;et alle \u00fee creatures in heuene & in eerthe, schullen not mowe heele \u00fee wounde of it.  Thanne schal \u00fee opene eerthe swelwe hem down in to helle, wheere \u00feei schullen be turmented with feendis euermore withouten eende.  But allas! \u00feeer been, i dreede, ful meny \u00feat neuere wollen bileeue \u00feise \u00feinges eer \u00feei feelen hem.  Of whom seith seynt Euseby \u00feus: Ve ve quibus est datum hoc prius sentire quam credere, \u00feat is:  'Woo, woo be to hem to whom it is &yogh;euen rather to feele \u00feise \u00feinges \u00fean to bileeue hem'. & \u00feus eendeth \u00fee \u00feridde arwe.

And this is not oonliche to telle to syke men, but eke to hoole men, ffor euery day a man neigheth his deeth neer and neer, ffor the moore a man in this lyf wexith in dayes and &yogh;eres, the moore he vnwexith.  For, as seyntes seyn:  \u00fee firste day in the whiche a man is born is \u00fee firste day of his deth, ffor euery day he is diynge while he is in this lyf.  And therfore seith \u00fee gospelle:  'Awake, for \u00feou wost neuere whiche hour god is to come, in thi &yogh;outhe or in thi myddel age or in thi laste dayes, or preuyliche or openliche.

Here-of bereth \u00fee gospel witnesse where Criste seide to ten myselis whanne thei weren heelyd of here lepre:  'Goth, he seith, and nyle &yogh;e synne moore, lest &yogh;e fallen wersse', als who seith: for &yogh;oure synne &yogh;e hadde this seeknesse.
