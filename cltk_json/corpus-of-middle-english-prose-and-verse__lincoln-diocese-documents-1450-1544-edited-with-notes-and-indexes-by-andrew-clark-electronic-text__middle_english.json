{"englishTitle": "Lincoln diocese documents, 1450-1544 / edited, with notes and indexes by Andrew Clark [electronic text]", "text": {"0": {"0": {"0": "I: Will, 1450, of Joan Buckland, widow of Richard\nBuckland, of Edgcott, Northamptonshire.", "1": "From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln,\nlf. 55 to lf. 56.  In the same Register, at lf. 84 bk. to 85 bk., is a\nsecond copy of this will.  In this second copy the surname always\nappears as 'Bokeland'; and the verb 'wol', or 'woll', is generally\n'will', but sometimes 'wyll'.  The chief other variants of the second\ncopy are given in the footnotes.  Some slight clerical errors in the\nfirst copy have been corrected from the second copy without\ncomment.", "2": "This Dame Buckland was a notable housemistress, and her enumeration\nof, and division of, her household and personal effects are pleasingly\nminute and distinct.", "3": "One of her phrases invites a note, since it\ntouches on a point as to bed-linen which occurs in several other of\nthese wills, but is now practically forgotten.  Linen was then woven\nin a long narrow web, incapable of providing a sheet of sufficient\nwidth for any ordinary bed.  The usual practice was to take three\nlengths from such a web and sew them together at their edges so as to\nform a sheet of the desired width.  This arrangement had the\nadvantage, from the point of view of household economy, that, when the\nmiddle strip grew thin by use, the long seams could be unpicked, and\none of the less worn side-strips put in the middle, removing the\noriginal middle-strip to the edge.  When this fresh middle-strip\nbecame thin in its turn, it changed places with the other side-strip.\nEach of these strips was called, in English, a 'leaf', or a 'breadth';\nin Latin, a folium .  Dame Buckland uses\n'leaf'.  Half-widths occur; e.g. sheets of 'two leaves and a half',\nsome apparently for coverlets, others for narrower beds.  Ancient beds\nwere constructed for two, or even several, persons sleeping\ntogether. Shakespeare, in Twelfth Night , mentions\nthe then proverbial 'great bed of Ware', in Hertfordshire, which\nrequired a sheet of twelve feet square.", "4": "Dame Bucklands's bequests include four service-books, catalogued,\nin the way then in universal use, by the first words of the recto of\ntheir second leaf.  Such books, to begin their first leaf, had\ngenerally a more or less elaborate illumination, so that the first\nwords of the second leaf supplied a simpler distinctive mark by which\nto recognize them.

This document is in a somewhat difficult hand, and the\nreading in some words is quite doubtful.  A feature of the deed is the\nabandonment of the old \u00fe, to make use of 'y'.  The testator\ndisposes of a noteworthy collection of relics, of several devotional\nbooks, and of a MS. of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales .\nThe devotional books seem to have partly come from religious houses\n(Grace Dieu priory in Leicestershire, and an unnamed Friary).  Special mention is made of a Latin Psalter (David sauter);\nof Walter Hilton's (died 1396) de vita contemplativa et activa , or, at\nleast, of the second part of it; and of de vita Christi , possibly the\ntreatise by Ludovicus de Saxonia, but see Bonaventura's Speculum vitae Christi (as noticed in Oseney\nEnglish Register , E.E.T.S., 1913, p. ix.)  Some slight\npeculiarities of the hand have been purposely omitted, e.g. a sort of\ncontraction mark over will, several false starts, and a flourish at\nend of proper names.

The letter was no doubt enrolled in respect of some\nmatrimonial suit.  The following notes taken from the official\nminute-book of the Archdeacon of Essex may serve, although of much\nlater date, to suggest the nature and the frequency of such\nsuits. 2 May, 1592: before the Official of the Archdeacon of\nEssex, in a Court held in Romford chapel, Essex, Susan Clarke of\nBarking, Essex, accused of bigamy, produced a certificate from\nhouseholders of Tattershall, Lincolnshire, that her pretended husband\n\u2026 Bowlt, and also her pretended husband \u2026 Gryse, had\nboth of them wyves lyving when they maryed with Susan: and afterwards,\nand by due order of lawe, she was separated from them both.  She\nproduced also a certificate that her husband, William Clarke, was\nrecently deceased.  The charge was withdrawn. 3 May, 1592:\nbefore the Official of the Archdeacon of Essex, in a Court held in\nIngatestone church, Essex, John Wylson of Laindon Hills, was ordered\nto bring a certificate of his marriage with Joan Streates; and to\nanswer the charge that, at the time of that marriage, he had another\nwif lyvinge. 5 May, 1592, Richard Weston, of Sutton, Essex, was\nbrought into the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held at Maldon,\nbecause suspected to have two wives alive, and not lawfully maryed to\nher that he now kepeth.  His defence was that his first wife (Ellen\nBrowne) had died at Fulham beyond London. 24 April, 1593, Jaspar\nHarman, of Grays Thurrock, Essex, was prosecuted in a Court of the\nArchdeacon of Essex held in Romford chapel, on the charge that he hath\nii. wyves.  His plea was: about xvi. yeres agone he was married in\nEastwood church, Essex, to Margaret Battell, with whom he continued\nabout 10 or 12 yeares; and since that time, about a yeare last past,\nhe was married in Rushmore parish church, neare vnto Ipswich in\nSuffock, to Agnes Ive, with whome he continueth; and that both the\nsame women are yet living, and he not deforced from any of\nthem.

The estate was a large and complicated one; and the ultimate\ndivision of its members, under entail, between testator's four sons\nwas far from simple.  The intention of the will and codicils is also\ngreatly obscured by the absence of information as to the most\nimportant item of the demise, viz.  the estates settled on testator's\neldest son (his successor in his baronies).", "2": "The Lovel family was by origin of Minster Lovel, Oxfordshire.\nAccording to the Peerages accessible to me, the\ntestator, Williamn Lovel, at the age of 17, succeeded his father John\nLovel (6th baron), in 1414, as 7th baron Lovel (of Tichmarsh,\nNorthamptonshire), and was summoned as a baron to Parliament from 1425\nto 1453.  He also succeeded his father in the barony of Holland (or\nHoland), which had been brought into the Lovel family by the marriage\nof Maud, granddaugther and heiress of Robert de Holland, 2nd baron\nHolland (1342-73), to John, 5th baron Lovel, testator's grandfather.\nThe barony of Burnell, to which the testator here asserts his claim,\nseems to have been without official recognition.  Edward Burnell,\nfirst baron Burnell, was summoned to Parliament 1311 to 1314, but died\n1315, leaving his sister Maud as his heiress.  At his death the barony\nof Burnell became, in law, extinct.  Maud Burnell married, as her\nfirst husband, John Lovel, 2nd baron Lovel of Tichmarsh, who died\n1314; and as her second husband, Sir John Haudlo, summoned to\nParliament as baron Haudlo 1342.  By one of the perplexing intricacies\nof the Peerage writs, the summonses to Parliament, 1350-1420, directed\nto baron Burnell, were sent to Maud Burnell's descendants by her\nsecond marriage, but the Lovel family seems to have obstinately, in\nword at least, persevered in its claim to the title.", "3": "The whole proceeding can best be understood by a rough pedigree:", "4": "The Peerage problems are worked out in the larger modern Peerages .  All that concerns us here is to note that\nthese accumulated peerages brought into the Lovel family not only the\nownership of the estates of those baronies, but also according to the\nideas of the age, the obligation to provide and maintain intercessory\nservices for members of the extinct families (supra 68/20).  Hence,\ntestator's intense desire for a perpetual two-priest chantry. William Lovel, 7th baron Lovel, by a marriage which reminds us of\nthe epigram Tu, felix Austria, nubes, had brought into his family,\nbesides the two baronies he inherited, and the barony he claimed, two other baronies.  He had, therefore, an\nexceptional number of manors to dispose of in his will.  If we had\naccess to his marriage-settlement, we should probably find that it\ndirected him to entail certain of his wife's manors on their younger\nsons. The foundation of this chantry-chapel might well be used as a\nfoot-note appended to a lament over the vanity of human wishes, as\nexpressed in the telling lines of Robert Burns: The best laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft agley. Greyfriars Convent in Oxford, by the fame of Roger Bacon, was the\nbest-known house of the Order in England.  Its church was one of the\ngreatest.  But, at the Dissolution, it was so completely destroyed,\nthat all memory of the Lovel chapel was rooted out.  Anthony Wood ( City of Oxford , ii. 383), making his list of eminent\npersons buried in this church, has no mention of William, Lord Lovel.\nThe fact was first brought to light by Alfred Gibbons in his list of Early Lincoln Wills , 1888.  Even the admirable\nmonograph on The Grey Friars in Oxford , by\nA. G. Little (O.H.S. 1892) could only add (p. 106) that in the\narrangements made by lord Lovel for his burial here 'a bequest would\nno doubt be included'.  Railway cuttings, botanists tell us, often\nbring back to a district plants long extinct there, and so now\nDr. Furnivall's research has brought to light this long-forgotten\nLovel chantry in Oxford.

[These Articles Englished.] List of heretical tenets publicly maintained by William Sparke and\nhis brother Richard Sparke, of Somersham, in the diocese of Lincoln,\nand afterwards publicly acknowledged by them before John, lord bishop\nof Lincoln. 1. Crosses and Images set up in Churches ought not to be\nworshipped; and offerings ought not to be made at them, since they are\nonly stocks and stones.  A human being had better worship a man with\narms stretched out cross-wise, since that is a true cross and image of\nGod. 2. Pilgrimages ought not to be made to places where the bodies of\nsaints rest.  The expenditure incurred in such pilgrimages is wasted,\nand the toil undergone is profitless. 3. A child whose parents have been baptized has no need of baptism,\nand ought not to be baptized, since its parents' baptism is sufficient\nfor it. 4. Laymen who are married or who are engaged in manual labour are\nnot bound to fast.  Christ is nowhere found to have instituted\nfastings of this sort.  The Canonical Rule of the Church put forward\nin this respect is binding only on clerics and on inmates of convents. 5. To bury a corpse in consecrated ground does the soul of the dead\nperson no more good than if the corpse had been thrust into a bog.\nThe solemnities of funerals were invented to provide fees for\nmoney-loving priests.  It would be better if funeral expenses went in\nalms to the poor than to enrich priests. 6. A priest has no more power to make 'the body of Christ' than the\nwheat-stalk has.  After the words of consecration the bread remains\nonly bread as before; and, in fact, is debased by having had such\nspell-words pronounced over it. 7. Thirty breads of this sort are sold for one halfpenny, but\nChrist was sold for thirty pence.  The sacrament after this fashion is\ntherefore a figment devised to enrich priests. 8. Confession made to a believer of the Lollard sect is more\nsoul-healing than confession made to a priest. 9. Inasmuch as God is the searcher of all hearts and the knower of\nall secrets, an unspoken prayer is just as good as a spoken prayer,\nand a prayer made in a field or other unconsecrated place is just as\nefficacious as if it were made in a church. 10. The sole requisite for a valid marriage is mutual consent\nbetween the man and the woman, and no other solemnity is needed to\njustify their living together as man and wife.  The marriage-service\nwas brought in solely to provide fees for priests. 11. Extreme unction does not benefit the soul of any man.  The only\nresult of this anointing ('greasing,' we call it in English) is to\ndirty and make vile the person's body. 12. The Pope is Antichrist; priests are the disciples of\nAntichrist.  All persons in Holy Orders are incarnate devils. 13. Every human being is called 'the church of God'.  Therefore, if\nany Lollard is brought before the judge of an ecclesiastical court and\nrequired to answer the question Dost thou believe in the Church?  he\nmay answer without scruple I do; since by his belief in the Church he\nstates only that he believes in man, who is 'the temple of God'. 14. Each of the accused publicly admitted that, in a large meeting\nof Lollards, he had solemnly taken oath upon the Bible (i) that he\nwould use his utmost diligence to bring into the Lollard sect as many\nas ever he could prevail upon, and (ii) that he would reveal to no\noutsider the existence of the sect or the names of its adherents until\nthey were strong enough in numbers to destroy Antichrist and all\nAntichrist's disciples; and this (he at that time asserted) would soon\nbe. [Notes on the preceding Articles.] 1. That a man with outstretched arms is 'an image of God' seems to\nbe a Lollard exposition of Gen. i. 27, 'God created man in his own\nimage.' A gift of money to a particular image, or to an altar dedicated to\na particular saint in a church, was a recognized act of devotional\ncharity.  In many cases, a donor silently left a coin on the pedestal\nof the image or on the altar, just as nowadays a charitable visitor\ndrops a coin into an alms-box in a church.  At one time, it is on\nrecord that such offerings were of appreciable value.  When\nWestminster Abbey, on 21 October, 1356, impropriated the rectory of\nSawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, special covenant was made that 'all\noblations in any wise so ever offered to the image of the Blessed\nMary' in that church should go to Westminster Abbey, not to the vicar\nof Sawbridgeworth. Lincoln College accounts have these notes in respect of this custom\nat All Saints Church, Oxford: '1505, Sexagesima week, 1-2d. was found on the altar of\nSt. Anne. 1510, June, a stranger woman offered 1d. at the image\nof All Saints. 1517, received in oblations before the image of the\nSaviour, 3d.; in oblations before the image of St. Mildred,\n2d. 1520, some one offered to the image of All Saints, 1d. 1527, Aug., received in several oblations at the image of the\nSaviour, 2d.' 2. The southern pilgrimage, from Southwark to the shrine of Thomas\nBecket at Canterbury had (1383), long before this, provided Chaucer\nwith the framework of his Canterbury Tales .\nHuntingdonshire folk were probably more familiar with the pilgrimage\nto Walsingham in Norfolk.  At Little Walsingham there was a chapel\ndedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, beside which was a spring\n(St. Mary's well or the Holy well).  A cross stood on a stone slab\nunder the edge of this spring.  Here pilgrims knelt, while they\nsecretly wished for what they wanted, and afterwards threw a piece of\ngold on the slab \u2014 A Description of England and\nWales (1769), iv. 266.  A popular tune ('Walsingham') took its\ntitle from this pilgrimage: Clark's Shirburn Ballads (1907), p. 245.  Foreign pilgrimages, taken (at this period) to\nCompostella in Spain, to Triers or Cologne, or the Santa Casa at\nLoretto in Italy, were both toilsome and costly. 3. In their teaching as to the sacrament of baptism, these Lollards took up an exaggerated 'Traducian' position.  In orthodox\ndoctrine it was maintained that original sin was transmitted from\nparents to child.  The Lollards maintained that, in like manner, the\ngrace conferred by baptism was transmitted from baptized parents to\nchild.  Baptism, in such cases, was therefore superfluous, since the\ngrace it was supposed to confer had been inherited at birth. 4. The official canons of the Church, after some centuries of\nvarying practice, had finally appointed, as of obligation, abstinence\nfrom flesh and fowl on Fridays and Wednesdays weekly; on the vigils\n(or eves) of Sundays and Festivals; on Saturdays (as well as on\nWednesdays and Fridays) in the Ember weeks; and, especially, during\nthe forty days of Lent.  Transgressions of these fasts were sedulously\nsought out by the officials of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and the\ntransgressors brought into Court and punished, often severely.  The\nLollard position was that these rules ought not to be imposed on the\nlaity.  It was perhaps emphasized by an exposition of\nSt. Matt. ix. 14, 'thy disciples fast not.' 5. Burial within the walls of a church meant a considerable fee\n(latterly 6s. 8d.) to the rector of the parish, if the grave were in\nthe chancel; to the churchwardens, on the parish account, if it were\nelsewhere in church.  A grave in the churchyard meant a small fee to\nthe churchwardens.  There were also the fees of the parish-priest, the\nparish-clerk, and the ringer of the knell at the actual funeral.  See\nthe lease of All Saints Church, Oxford, 1539, and the notes about that\nchurch in the Forewords. 6. The Lollard position as regards Transubstantiation, a dogma made\nobligatory by the first Lateran Council, 1215. 7. An attempt at a reductio ad absurdum argument.  If the host were the body of Christ it should be worth,\neven at Judas's valuation, 30 silver-pennies (St. Matt. xxvi. 15), how\nthen could a wafer be the body of Christ when it could be bought for\n1-60d.? 8. Apparently the Lollard exposition of St. James v. 16: 'Confess\nyour faults one to another.' 9. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9; well known because taken into an\nintroductory Collect in the Ordinary of the Mass in the use of Sarum,\nwhence it has passed into the Anglican service-book. 10. This tenet fixed itself firmly in the minds of the lower people.  In Elizabeth's reign and later the Archdeacons' courts were\nconstantly appealed to by churchwardens to deal with cases where a man\nand a woman, after publication of banns, lived together as man and\nwife, without marriage in church.  An excellent example is found in\nthe Archdeacon of Colchester's Court, held at Henham, Essex, 27\nNov. 1620, when action was taken against Nicholas Searle and Elizabeth\nDye, of Saffron Walden, for `livinge together, the banes of matrimonye\nbeinge asked longe since, and not married'.  The legislation of the\nCommonwealth made this, for the time, legal and normal.  See, e.g., Essex Arch. Soc. Transactions , vol. xiii. pt. 3\n(Jan. 1914). 11. Unction might be recognized by St. James v. 14, but this use of\noil was a frequent subject of popular gibes.  It is so found as late\nas Sir Walter Scott's Waverley , chap. lxii. 12. The deadly hatred which later controversy directed against the\nPope and Romanist clergy (see verses and woodcuts in Ballad Society's issues), as a dreaded foreign and\nhostile power, was felt by Lollards against the whole Church, Anglican\nas well as Roman. 13. This carefully-taught equivocation, by which Lollards were\ntrained to meet the searching inquiries of Ecclesiastical Courts, is a\nremarkable addition to the history of casuistry.  It rests on a\nLollard exposition of 1 Cor. iii. 16 ('Know ye not that ye are the\ntemple of God'). 14. Is it possible that there was in 1457, in mid-England, a\nmilitant Lollard party, secretly mustering forces with a view to an\narmed rising?  It is conceivable that traditions of the Peasants'\nRevolt of 1381 had been handed on from father to son and grandson.  In\nthe south, Henry V's ruthless proceedings against Sir John Oldcastle\n(1414-17) may have crushed the spirits and strength of the Lollards,\nonly to leave smouldering fires of discontent further north.", "3": "[II.

[Simplified English rendering of the Public Penance\nimposed on the Somersham Lollards by the Ecclesiastical Court.] [A.] John Chedworth, bishop of Lincoln, issued a mandate to the\nRural Dean of Huntingdon, the Rural Dean of St. Ives, the Rector (or\nhis parochial deputy) of Somersham, and the parochial chaplain of Ramsey,\nall in Huntingdonshire. [B.] He informed them that William Sparke, and Richard Sparke, of\nSomersham, Huntingdonshire, (i) had been informed against as holding Lollard opinions and\nconsorting with Lollards; (ii) had been, with reason, suspected by the bishop's court of\nthese offences; (iii) had been cited to appear before the Ecclesiastical Court, to\nanswer articles involving charges of heresy; (iv) had attended the Court; and answered in person, when their\nnames were called out; (v) and had admitted that the articles alleged against them\nrepresented, one by one, the heads of their teaching. [C.] Thereupon, William Sparke and Richard Sparke, (vi) had been told that these tenets of theirs were false,\nheretical, and contrary to the decision of the holy Roman church; (vii) had desired to abandon their heretical tenets, and in future\nto cleave to Catholic doctrine and observe the unity of the Church; (viii) had expressed their abhorrence of their past heresies, as\nbeing in contradiction to the Catholic faith and the holy Roman\nchurch; and had done so publicly and in writing; (ix) had submitted themselves to be dealt with by the Court, making\nhumble petition to be absolved from the greater excommunication which\nthey had, by these offences, brought on themselves; (x) and had asked that such penance, as should be thought adequate\nto their offences, should be put upon them. [D.] Wherefore, the Ecclesiastical Court, remembering that the\nbosom of the Church is ever open to those who seek reconciliation, and\nthat God willeth not the death of a sinner but that the sinner should\nrather be converted and live, (xi) exacted of William Sparke and Richard Sparke a solemn oath\nthat in future they would avoid like offences; (xii) absolved them from the greater excommunication; (xiii) and imposed upon them this following form of penance, viz. \u2014 [E.] William Sparke and Richard Sparke shall, each of them, (xiv) clad only in his breeches and his shirt, bearing a fagot on\nhis neck and shoulders, and carrying a penny wax-candle (lighted) in\nhis hand; (xv) once on the usual market-day, in full market-time, meekly, as\na penitent, walk round the public market-place of the town of\nHuntingdon; once, in the same way, walk round the market-place of St. Ives; once,\non a Sunday or Holy-day (when the procession takes place and there is\ntherefore a great attendance of people), in the same way, walk round\nthe Churchyard of Somersham; and once, in the same way, round the\nChurchyard of Ramsey; (xvi) and, when this penance has been fully done, shall, on bended\nknees, humbly offer what remains of his wax-candle as an offering to\nthe altar of that church where his penance is concluded. [F.] Moreover, the Ecclesiastical Court, in the name of the\ncanonical obedience due by them to the bishop, and under threat of\npunishment for neglect of this mandate, called upon each of the\nabove-mentioned priests, (xvii) to attend at the market-place or churchyard which was within\nhis own special jurisdiction, each duly attired in surplice and stole,\nand having a rod in his hand, on the days appointed; (xviii) to carry out the order of John Leek, the bishop's\nCommissary, by summoning the two Lollards to stand forth to undergo\npenance according to the form already set forth; (xix) to follow them as they walked round market-place and\nchurchyard; (xx) and to beat and discipline them (with the rod) at each corner\nof the market-place or churchyard, proclaiming, publicly and in the\nvulgar tongue, the cause of this penance. [G.] Further, the four clerics are required to certify carefully,\nin English (?), in writing and under seal, what each of them did in\nthis matter on each day of the penance and how the two Lollards bore\nthemselves in doing it. [H.] This mandate was issued, under the Bishop's seal ad causas, at\nBuckden manor, in Huntingdonshire, 27 May, 1457, in the bishop's fifth\nyear from his consecration. [VII.

[Abbreviated English rendering.] (i) On 27 June, 1457, in the fifth year of the consecration of\nJohn Chedworth, bishop of Lincoln, and in the prebendal church of\nBuckden in Huntingdonshire, in the diocese of Lincoln, (ii) William Sparke (and his wife) of Somersham, Huntingdonshire,\nand Richard Sparke (William's brother), appeared. (iii) When questioned by the bishop about the Articles preferred\nagainst them, they admitted that these set forth the tenets that they\nhad maintained; (iv) but they, then and there, abjured these and all other\nheretical tenets, (v) and read aloud their abjurations in the mother tongue. (vi) Thereupon, the bishop assigned them soul-saving penance (as\non pp. 100, 101), (vii) and directed certain priests (as on p. 99) to call upon\nWilliam Sparke and Richard Sparke to do penance, as ordered them. (viii) Witnesses on this occasion were \u2014 Thomas Leger, bishop of Limerick, and suffragan to John, bishop of\nLincoln; Richard Halle, Doctor of Decrees; William Wytham, Doctor of Laws; Thomas Estyngton and Edmund Shiref, Masters of Arts; John Rudyng, Bachelor of Laws; Thomas Michell, Bachelor of Decrees, and perpetual Vicar of Buckden; John Bugg, John Tyssington, and Laurence Bartelott, notaries public\nby licence of the Pope and the emperor; and many others. [Note as to Penances imposed by the Ecelesiastical\nCourts.] The severity, and unnecessarily humiliating features, of the\npunishments imposed in the Ecclesiastical Courts continued right on\ninto Elizabeth's reign, or even later.  From the official minute-books\nof the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, I give some hitherto\nunpublished notices of these 'penances', which both illustrate the\nsystem and show how each individual penance differed at the discretion\nof the presiding judge.  The conjunction of open penance in both\nmarket and church continued a long time, but was gradually replaced by\nopen penance in church only. 15 December, 1569, a young woman of High Ongar, Essex, was\nsentenced by the Archdeacon of Essex to appeare at Chelmsford to do open penaunce in the markett, in a\nsheet, and ther to confesse her offense penitently, and on Sunday\nafter to do the lyke in Ongar church. 16 December, 1590, a young woman of Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, was\nordered \u2014 vpon Satterdaye nexte to come into Malden towne, where she shal be\nplaced openly vpon some scaffolde, abowte xi. of the clocke in the\nforenoone of the same daye, and shall there stand vntill one of the\nclock in the afternoone of the same daye, in a white sheete, and a\nwhite wande in her hand; and the next Sunday following she shall come into the church of\nBradwell, at the beginninge of the first lesson for morning praier,\nattired in a whyt sheet, and shall there in penitent manner continewe\nvntyll the service and sermon be ended. On 17 June, 1591, a parishioner of Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex,\nreceived this sentence in the Archdeacon of Essex's Court: He shall vpon the next Saboth, or vpon Sundaye come sevenighte, at\nthe beginninge of morninge praier, come into the church of Burnham,\napparrelled in a white sheete, and white wande in his hande, and there\nshal be placed in some conveniente place, neare the minister and in\nsighte of the congregation there assembled, and so stande vntill such\ntyme as the minister in the tyme of sermon (or of readinge of an\nhomilie) shall call for him, and then [he] shall confesse and\nacknowledge that, whereas he hath byn called before the judge of this\ncorte for suspicion of evil life, and by denieing therof hath had the\nbenefytt of law to purge him selfe (if he so cold), wherein he hath\nfayld, and is therefore founde by lawe and pronounced for guiltye of\nthe fact, he doth therefore acknowledg that he hath grevously offended\nthe maiestie of God in his wicked life and adulterous lyvinge; for\nwhich his most wicked and adulterous life, he shall aske mercy at the\nhands of almighty God and desire him in his mercy to pardon him his\nformer ill life, and desire the congregation presente also to forgyve\nhim, and to pray with him that he may be forgyven his wickednes at\nGod's hands; and promise amendment of his former wickednes; and shall\nthen say some praier after the minister, at the minister's discretion. 12 December, 1592, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in\nIngatestone Church, a parishioner of Downham, Essex, had this\nsentence: On Sundaie next he shall come to Downham Churche at the last peale\nto servyce, and there stand in a white sheete at the church porche\ntill the second lesson be redd, and then shall goe into the Church,\nand there stand and penitently confesse his fault and offence. It was certified in a Court, held 19 January, 1592-3, that this\npenance had been performed. This humiliating form of public penance became still more degraded\nwhen people of substance could purchase exemption from it.  It is one of the many indications of the great poverty of\nElizabeth's reign that Ecclesiastical Judges are found readily\nassenting to 'commutation' of penance.  Even where the Archdeacon did\nnot feel authorized to allow such commutation, an appeal to the Bishop\nwas generally successful in obtaining it.  The following examples are\nall authentic, being taken from the official minute-books of the Court\nof the Archdeacon of Essex, and are, I think, fairly representative of\nthis unpleasant feature of English social life.  Wealthy people could\nbuy commutation; poor people continued to be exposed to open shame. 13 December, 1569, the Archdeacon of Essex sentenced a parishioner\nof Leyton, Essex, to penance: viz. that he should stande in Romford\nmarkett, the next markett daye, more\npenitentis , all the markett tyme, in a whyte sheate, and a\nrod in his hande, and in his parish church of Leyton, in the same way,\non the Sunday following, and ther shall acknowledg his offens\npenitently. But, on appeal of the man so sentenced, backed by entreaty of some\nof his neighbours, he was excused penance, on condition of giving\n10s. each to three poor scholars of Cambridge, and 10s. towards the\nrepair-fund of Leyton church. 29 February, 1591-2, a parishioner of Romford, who had been\nordered public penance in Romford Chapel, on a Sunday, in the time of\nMorning Prayer, brought a petition in his favour signed by some\nparishioners, and was allowed to substitute semi-private penance\nbefore the minister and some parishioners selected by the minister, on\ncondition of putting 20s. into the hands of the minister to be\ndistributed by him among the poor of Romford liberty. 31 March, 1596, William Tabor, Archdeacon of Essex, who had\nordered public penance to two persons, received a letter, dated 4\nMarch, 1595-6, in which Richard Fletcher, bishop of London, in\nconsideration of money paid to him 'to be imployed in godly uses',\ndischarged both parties from obligation to do penance, and ordered all\nproceedings against them in the Ecclesiastical Courts to cease."}, "11": {"0": "XII: Proceedings, taken 1457, against Thomas Hull of\nHertford, for practising the Black Art.", "1": "From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln, apparently from\nleaf 14 or lf. 14 bk., but presumably not the whole record.", "2": "The belief in the power of 'necromancers' (adepts in the 'black\nart') to invoke evil spirits, and compel them to discover buried\ntreasure, and render like services, continued so late that the\npractice became not only a favourite theme of the raconteur and\nnovelist (see John Aubrey's Brief Lives , under Thomas\nAllen, i. 27, and John Dee, i. 213, and Sir Walter Scott's Waverley , ch. xiii), but an anathema of the Statute-books\n(both English, viz. 1563, 5 Eliz. cap. 16; and Scottish, see Sir\nWalter Scott's Waverley , chap. lxvii).", "3": "Charges of witchcraft, as being against the Canon Law, were\nconstantly brought before the Ecclesiastical Courts.  I give here a\nnumber of later authentic instances of such charges, taken from the\nofficial minute-books of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex.  They\nserve to illustrate this old Hertfordshire case, as mentioned in this\nset of papers; and also to indicate the wide range of this popular\nbelief.", "4": "12 July, 1591, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in\nWest Ham Church, two widows of Woodford, Essex, were cited to answer\ncharges of witchcraft.  In both cases, since the charge is preferred\nby one person, it was probably brought in by a man who believed\nhimself to have been bewitched. Widow May, of Woodford, accused: she hath of long tyme byne\nsuspected for a wiche, and nowe of late suspected by William\nFoxe. Widow Coppres, of Woodford, accused: she hath of long time\nbeen suspected for a wiche, and nowe of late by John Poole.", "5": "In many cases recourse was had to the reputed wizard, in the belief\nthat he could by his skill detect a thief: 3 February, 1591-2, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held\nin Romford Chapel, John Munday, of Loughton, Essex, appeared, on a\ncharge made by the Churchwardens there, that he 'went to a connyng man\nto learne of goods that were stolen or gon.'  The case was\ndismissed. 16 June, 1595, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex,\nheld in Romford Chapel, the churchwardens of Barking, in Essex,\ncomplained that \u2014 Carter, of that parish, is generally reported\nto be a cunning man, 'and dothe take monye of diuerse to helpe theim\nto things lost and stolen, viz. of one for 2 clokes stolen, <of\nanother> for a ring lost.'", "6": "Another common reason of resort to conjurers, was to obtain their\nhelp to force spirits to reveal the position of buried treasure.\nThere was an entertaining instance of this at Beeleigh Abbey, near\nMaldon, Essex, in 1591: see Essex Review , xvi. 68. Frequently the supposed wizard, or cunning man, was consulted about\nillness, human or of cattle. 2 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in\nRomford Chapel, John Grave, junior, of Romford, was delated by the\nchurchwardens there that he 'doth goe and seeke after witchery.'\nAccused said that his wife, without his consent, 'did goe to father\nPerfoche, to learne of him some medycyne for some cattell that he had\nsick, but he knoweth not that father Perfoche is a witche; and his\nwife (as he verely beleveth) did neuer thinke him to be a witche, and\nwent not to him desirouse to obtaine any helpe for his cattell by any\nsuche meanes.' Grave was solemnly admonished against having\nrecourse to sorcery; and was dismissed the Court on payment of 2s.\nCourt-fees. In the same Court, on the same day, on the same\ncharge, proceedings were instituted against William Moushowe, of\nRomford, with the same result. To repel a charge of this sort, the accused person, if allowed by\nthe Court, might produce written testimony of good character. 2 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in\nRomford Chapel, Alice, wife of William Foster of Barkinge, suspected\nby common fame to be a witche, brought a certificate of her innocency\nunder the hands of the Churchwardens there.  The case was dismissed,\nbut the accused had to pay the Court-fee (12d.) and the apparitor's\nfee (4d.), as well as the expenses of the journey to Romford. 3 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in\nIngatestone Church, it was reported that one Whaple of Fobbing did\nmake complaint against Joan Bell, of Fobbing, of suspicion of\nwytchcraft.  She appeared in Court, and 'vtterly denieth' the\nsuspicion to be true.  She was ordered to bring to a later Court a\ncertificate from 'fower of her honest neighbors' that she is reputed\nto be an honest woman and not at all thought to be a witch. On\n2 June, 1592, she brought into Court a certificate from honest women\nof Fobbing that she lay under no suspicion of witchcraft. In other cases the Court refused to allow an accused person to\nclear himself, except by the cumbrous and expensive process of\ncompurgation.  A deed was drawn out, to be publicly read, on a Sunday,\nin the church of the parish where the offence was alleged to have been\ncommitted, announcing that at a Court to be held at a given place and on a given day, the accused person\nproposed to purge himself of the charge by taking oath of innocence,\nand inviting all who objected to such purgation to attend the Court\nand give evidence against the accused.  The accused then attended the\nappointed Court, bringing with him his compurgators (in number four,\nsix, eight, or other number, as had been fixed by the Court), and\nexhibiting his parish-priest's certificate that the 'Intimacion' had\nbeen duly read.  Objectors were then invited to appear, and, if any\nattended, were heard, and the case adjourned.  If no objection was\nmade, the accused person took oath openly that he was innocent of the\ncharge, and each of the compurgators took oath that he believed that\nthe accused person had sworn the truth.  Compurgators for men had to\nbe men of good repute, of the same (or neighbouring) parish as the\naccused; for women, honest women, of the same (or neighbouring)\nparish; for clerics, beneficed clergy of neighbouring parishes.  On\nthe strength of these oaths, the accused was acquitted, and granted a\ncertificate to prevent any future proceedings on the same charge.  The\nfees were considerable: 2s. 6d. for the Intimacio; 4d. for each oath\ntaken; 13s. 4d. for the certificate; and, in addition, the usual fees\nto the Court and to the Apparitors.  Besides, the accused no doubt had\nto defray the day's expenses of those who appeared as compurgators. 5 May, 1592.  In a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in All\nSaints Church, Maldon, Margaret Wiseman (wife of John Wiseman of\nMaulden) was delated by the Churchwardens, for that she is suspected\nby common fame of wytchcrafte.  She claimed and was allowed purgation.\n5 July, 1592, she appeared in Court with her Compurgatrices (Judith\nwife of John Cowrtnol, Margaret wife of Thomas Carter, Agnes wife of\nGeorge Warner, Agnes wife of Robert Brierly, Agnes wife of Richard\nFlude, and Elizabeth wife of John Pratt \u2014 all of Maldon).  Margaret\nWiseman then took oath that she is 'altogether guyltless of the facte\nof witchcrafte and also of all occation of suspicion of witchcrafte'.\nHer six compurgatrices then took oath that Margaret Wiseman hath sworn\na just and true oath, and that she 'hath not geven any cause of\nsuspicion of witchcrafte'.  Her purgation was then admitted, and the\ntestimonial of its acceptance was signed; but the Judge of the Court\nsolemnly admonished her to be most careful in future to give no cause,\nin any way, for like suspicion.

The\nstory is not very clearly told in the Register, but this seems to be\nthe substance of it.  Two chief offences had been brought home to the\nculprit.  First, he had accepted bribes to foist Robert Cade, priest,\ninto the perpetual curacy of Aylesby (near Grimsby, Lincolnshire).\nThe Bishop of Lincoln presented to the rectory of Aylesby 24 March,\n1445-6 (Alnwick's Register, fol. 97), but the church was soon\nafterwards appropriated to Lincoln Minster.  The date of the\nproceedings is uncertain, since the documents in the Register are out\nof order, the one before Pyckard's case is 1458, but the one before\nthat is 1557.  The one after Pyckard's case is 1564.  So far as I can\nmake out, bishop John Chedworth had claimed the right of presentation\nto the curacy on this occasion for himself, on some technical ground.\nThe bishop had then caused his mandate for the institution of his\nnominee to be made out, and committed it to this notary (Richard\nPyckard) for transmission to 'Master' Alexander, who was possibly\nacting as deputy of the Archdeacon of Lincoln.  Richard Pyckard,\nthereupon broke open the sealed envelope ('pyxis'), removed the\nbishop's real mandate, and substituted for it (probably by erasure of\nthe name in it and substitution of Robert Cade's name) a faked\nmandate, which deceived 'Master' Alexander, and procured the\ninstitution of Robert Cade to the benefice.  Secondly, in some transactions, Richard Pyckard had\nrepresented himself to be a much-trusted local attorney, by name Roger\nJordan, and, under cloak of that name, had executed fraudulent deeds,\npossibly in connexion with the advowson dispute. The Ecclesiastical Court, which dealt with the case, under\npresidency of William Wytham, LL.D. (Archdeacon of Stow, 1458-72, but\nacting in his capacity as chancellor, and Commissary of the bishop),\nRichard Hall (Official principal of the bishop of Lincoln), and\nRichard Dyklun (President of the Consistory Court of Lincoln), met in\nSt. Mary's church, Stamford. guilty man, in St. Michael's church, Stamford, was divested of\ncoat, shoes, and stockings, and led bareheaded, and barefooted, clad\nonly breeches and shirt, from that church to appear before his judges\nin St. Mary's church.", "2": "[I.

The\ndate is apparently the last days of December, 1468.  The greater part\nof the narrative is in Latin, of which only a summary is here given.\nFor this summary I am responsible.", "2": "Ordinary cases of breach of peace and assault were dealt with, in\nmost parishes, by the leet-courts of the several manors, and, in most\nmunicipalities, by the borough magistrates.  But, if the altercation\ntook place in a church or a churchyard, the case passed out of the\njurisdiction of any civil court, and came before the Ecclesiastical\nCourt, generally that of the Archdeacon.  Too frequently these cases\nwere trivial matters that could have been smoothed over without legal\nprocedure, except for the apparitor's keen search for fees.  To\nillustrate this Grantham case, from later years, I give a few\n(hitherto unpublished) notices of such cases, from the official\nminute-books of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex. 15 July, 1591, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in\nPrittlewell church, Thomas Peerse, of All Saints, Maldon, was\nindicted, at the instance of the Churchwardens there, because he\n'brake the pease and made a blood-shedd vpon Ralph tiler in the church\nof All Sainctes in the time of the sermon'. Peerse brought a certificate from Robert Palmer, vicar of All Saints,\nMaldon, that 'there was a lewde and vngratious boye that, in the tyme of\nthe sermon, did disturbe the people; and Thomas Peerse, sytting neare him,\ndid gyve him a stroke vpon the cheeke, after which the boye was quiett'. Thomas Peerse offered 'to make faithe that he did not strike the\nboye anie other wise, nor in other manner, nor vpon anie other\nintente'. Peerse was sentenced to pay 8d. to the poor, and excommunicated\nuntil further order. 15 January, 1591-2, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held\nat Romford, Richard Fynson of Loughton appeared to answer a charge of\nstriking John Monday in Loughton churchyard on Sept. 26, 1591.  He\nadmitted that `in gest and sport and not upon any collor or anger, he\ndid tripp vpp his heeles, as he was sytting vpon the Church rayles'.\nHe was ordered to confess publicly, before the minister and the\ncongregation, `that he hath vnorderly behaued himselfe', and to pay\n12d. to the poor of the parish. 3 June, 1592, in his Court held at Great Baddow, the Archdeacon of\nEssex had before him five parishioners of South Hanningfield, Essex,\non a charge of scolding and brawling in the churchyard there.  Henry\nSowche admitted that he had used some words of strife (being moved\nthereto), but now they are agreed and all things are quiet, and no\ncontention restethe amongst his neighbors.  For his offence, he was\nordered to make public apology in South Hanningfield Church.  William\nBennet's wife admitted having `vsed some words of strife, and vnkynde\nwords, towards some of her neighbors'.  She escaped on payment merely\nof the Court-fee (12d.).  Widow Holland was discharged, without paying\nfee, being very poor. 12 May, 1595, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Colchester, held in\nSaffron Walden church, Essex, John Waylett of Ugley, Essex, was\nproceeded against because he said to Robert Meade, church-clerk, in\nservice-tyme in the churchyard that `he was a pickthanck Knave to say\nthat his boy (John Waylett) dyd wrastle in the churchyard in the tyme\nof divine service at morning prayer'.  Waylett admitted calling Meade\n`knave' in the churchyard, but pleaded that Meade `urged hym therto,\nbrawling with hym in the churchyard'.  On this confession, in terms of\nthe statute, Waylett was excommunicated.", "3": "[I. English Summary of Latin Narrative.] The milestone marker has been included even though this is a summary of the latin narrative. There had been a conflict in the churchyard of the town of\nGrantham, between Thomas Wortley, Corvyser, and Edward Singer, a\nminister of that church.  It was presumed that the churchyard had\nthereby been polluted, and the matter was referred to the Vicar\n(Richard Dawe) and John Tyssington, acting as Commissaries for the\nbishop.  This Commission took the sworn evidence of Thomas Wortley\nhimself, of Sir Thomas Wynneway and Sir William lempster (priests),\nand of William lempster and William Welbourne (ministers of the\nchurch).  They found that Wortley had struck Singer violently with a\nstick, who shed blood from his nose in no small quantity, in the\nchurchyard.  The Commissaries further declared that the churchyard had\nthereby been polluted, and excommunicated Wortley.  On January 31, 146\n8-9, Wortley confessed his deed before John Chedworth, the bishop, in the house of Henry Curteys of\nGrantham; and took oath on the gospels to do penance as would be\nordered him.  The Bishop appointed Master John Goule, bachelor in the\ndecrees, to absolve Wortley from the excommunication which he had\nincurred.  The penance was that Wortley should go with bare shins\n( tibiis ) and feet at the time of the\nreconciliation of the churchyard by the bishop, and, humbly and in\npenitent wise, minister holy water, at the bishop's nod, to the bishop\nin the 'reconciliation' ceremony.  On Purification (2 February),\ni.e. on the second day after this verdict, Wortley was also, clad only\nin shirt and breeches, and carrying in one hand a wax taper and in the\nother a pair of beads, to walk humbly at the head of the procession\nwhich was to take place on that Feast, to kneel down at the four\ncorners of the churchyard or of the church (according as the weather\nallowed the procession to be in the open air or not), and to be\ndisciplined by the rod by the curate who was in charge of the\nprocession.  After the procession was over, at the time of High Mass,\nWortley was to be waiting in the baptistery, engaged in private\nprayer, and, when the offertory of the Mass was made, was to place his\ntaper in the hands of the celebrant.  Like penance was to be made on\nSundays, February 7 and 14, at the time of the procession on those\ndays.  Further, on Saturdays, February 6, 13, 20, and 27, at the hour\nwhen the market was fullest of people, Wortley, attired as a penitent,\nand with wax taper and beads, accompanied by the curate (in surplice\nand stole, and carrying a rod), was to walk round Grantham\nmarket-place, and at each of the four corners to submit himself to\ncorrection.

The\nlong reign of Henry VI (1 September, 1422, to 4 March, 1460-1) had\nbeen very fruitful both in benefactions to older secular colleges and\nreligious houses, and in new foundations for educational or religious\npurposes.  The recognition by Parliament of Edward IV on 4 March, 146\n0-1, followed by the Yorkist triumph at Towton, 29 March, 1461,\nthreatened the very existence of all recent foundations, and the\nimpoverishment of many older foundations, e.g. Eton College, and\nseveral colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, as well an monasteries.  The Crown lawyers of\nthe new sovereign seemed to be resolved to show in the law-courts the\nlike mercy to grants made by Henry VI (now designated 'king of England\nde facto but not de iure') as his troops had shown in the field in\ntheir savage slaughter of the vanquished Lancastrians.  The present\npetition is a representative of many hundreds of the sort which were\nsent up to Edward IV in these first years of deadly fear.  It is not\nfor a moment to be supposed that these details came within the King's\npersonal supervision or added anything to the revenues of the Crown:\nthey were processes which brought considerable fees to the\nlaw-officers of the Crown, and abundant payments to their underlings\nfor transcription, sealing, and registration. On 2 Aug. 1140,\nHenry VI, by grant under Privy Seal, gave to Bruerne Abbey the\npatronage of Wootton Church, with licence to impropriate it, but\nreserving \u00a38 yearly to the Exchequer.  The Pope and the Bishop\nof Lincoln would not allow the impropriation, and, on 18 June, 1445,\nHenry VI forgave the arrears of the \u00a38 charge, and cancelled\nfuture payments, until the impropriation had taken effect. The\npetition is prefixed to an Institution to Wootton, 18 Aug., 1464, on\npresentation by Edward IV.", "2": "[I. Full Text of Petition in English.] To oure liege lord the king.

The explanation of the enrolment of this agreement is most aptly\ngiven in a charter, dated Monday before All Saints' day (29 October),\n1274, found among Westminster Chapter Muniments, and brought to my\nnotice by Dr. W. Warde Fowler. The Priory of Hurley, Berkshire, agreed to allow, in consideration\nof the payment of 10s. half-yearly, the Rectory of Kingham,\nOxfordshire, quiet possession of certain tithes which the Priory used\nto collect in that parish.  But the Priory made this agreement\nconditional on the rector's obtaining, at his own costs, both from the\nBishop, and from the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln, a full ratification\nof the agreement so as to ensure its due observance in future.\nClearly, in this Syresham case, Biddlesden Abbey must have followed\nthe same course. A second stipulation made by Hurley Priory was even more drastic,\nand is most suggestive of the multitudinous trouble incident to\ncollection of tithe.  This stipulation was that (by the authority of\nthe Bishop and Chapter) the rector of Kingham and his successors\nshould bind themselves to allow the Archdeacon of Oxford (or his\nOfficial), if they had omitted to pay this ten shillings in any year,\nto compel them, by excommunication in the Archdeacon's Ecclesiastical\nCourt, on mere production of this agreement, to pay this\ntithe-rent-charge, with any arrears that had arisen, and all expenses\nincurred in connexion with the case; and should expressly renounce all\nright of appeal to any other law-court.", "2": "[I.] Compositio inter Abbatem et\nconventum de byttilsden et Rectorem de Sirisham.

By a singular oversight the dates of both letters are\nomitted.  No copy of the Orders referred to is contained in the\nRegister, but their import may be gathered from the letters\nthemselves, as well as from the summary given in Froude's History .", "2": "The first letter contains an odd bit of indirect evidence as to\nthe slowness with which even those in authority recognized the\nusefulness of the printer's art.  Although it was clearly of\nimportance that every cleric should know exactly the terms of the\nOrders he was called upon to observe, no printed copy of these Orders\nwas distributed, but individual clerics were invited to write out each\na copy for himself.  In 1536-7 (No. LV) printed copies of the King's\nOrders were provided for distribution.", "3": "The Orders issued as to preachers were intended to prevent pulpit\nhandling of the controversy as to the supremacy of the King or of the\nPope over the Church of England.  To that end, preachers were\nforbidden to handle controversial topics in their sermons, and to\nconfine themselves to exhortations to fear God and honour the King.\nThis was the precedent followed by Laud and Charles I, 1630 and\nonwards, in respect of the fierce controversy then waged as to\npredestination, when they forbade preachers to discuss the burning\nquestion of the hour.  In both instances, authority was defied.\nPreachers and congregations were too keenly interested in the\nforbidden topic to leave off discussing it.", "4": "Further, no cleric was to presume to preach unless he had had a\nlicence to preach granted him by his Bishop or Archdeacon.  Care\nwould, of course, be taken to refuse a licence to any cleric who was\nnotoriously opposed to the King's claims.", "5": "Because of the general contempt shown to these Orders, in his\nsecond letter, a year later in date, the bishop ordered the provision,\nand due keeping, of a register of preachers in every church, with a\nnote of the subject touched on in each sermon.  Following up this\nidea, the Archdeacons, till quite recent years, at their every\nVisitation, were very urgent with the Church-wardens of each parish to provide 'a Book of Strange Preachers'\nand see that entries were duly made in it.", "6": "Each sermon was at this time preceded by the Bidding-prayer, so\ncalled because in it the preacher asked the congregation to pray for\nthe persons, or the souls of persons departed, whom he specially\ncommended to them.  The terms of this prayer were left very much to\nthe preacher himself, as he might feel himself directed by the\nstatutes of the College to which he belonged or of the Chantry which\nhe served.  No doubt, preachers, up till now, had been in the habit of\nbeginning their bidding-prayer with the words, 'Ye shall pray for the\nholy father, the pope'; and this was now forbidden.  The\nbidding-prayer is still in use in Oxford before University Sermons in\nSt. Mary's Church and City Sermons in the church of All Saints and\nSt. Martin's, but in both cases the prayer now follows a printed form.", "7": "In the Register, on lf. 267, immediately after the two letters, two\ninhibitions are enrolled, one addressed to John Vyall, Warden of the\nFriars Minors of Bedford, the other to Edmund Philipes, rector of\nMaulden, Bedfordshire, cancelling their licences to preach and\nforbidding them to preach; dated, Old Temple, London, 11 March, 1535\n[5-6].", "8": "[First Letter: 1535 (?).] I commende me vnto you.

The preceding document is\ndated at Lincoln, 13 May, 1535; the document following is dated at\nWooburn 24 May, 1535.  Inasmuch as in this part of the Register the\ndocuments follow each other very closely in order of date, the receipt\nof the letter by the Bishop must be about the middle of May\n1535. The persecution of 'heretics' in France here mentioned,\nthe scattering about in the streets of Paris of pamphlets deriding the\ndoctrine of Transubstantiation, the great expiatory procession in\nParis, the king's fierce speech against 'heretics', and the public\nburning of several 'heretics', are all set out in the larger histories\nof France.  It is, however, something new to find a vivid description\nof these incidents from the pen of an English eyewitness.  It is more\nminute and exact, apparently, than the French record cited by\nSismondi.  A quaint touch is added by the haste of the letter-carrier\nto be off which prevented the writer from fair-copying his letter. The chief persons mentioned are \u2014 King Francois I, his\nconsort Eleanor of Austria, his eldest son (Francis the Dauphin, born\n1517, and now eighteen years old, died 10 Aug. 1536), his second son\nHenri (born 1519, and now sixteen years old, succeeded as Henri II in\n1547), his third son Charles (d. 1545), the two princesses (Madeleine,\nafterwards consort of James V of Scotland, and Margaret, afterwards\nDuchess of Savoy), Jean de Guise, of Lorraine, born 1498, Cardinal\nsince 1518, Jean du Bellay, bishop of Paris. It is recorded that\nthe Ambassadors of foreign powers, then present at the French Court,\nwere spectators of the procession.  Bishop John Longland's]\ncorrespondent may well have been someone of importance in the English\nambassador's suite.  It is interesting that the letter should be in\nEnglish, and good English, and not in Latin.  Two or three odd things\nare found in it, e.g. (i) the use of the French semblablement instead\nof the English semblably, suggestive of a person resident in France and\nconstantly speaking French; (ii) the phonetic spelling of le Chtelet,\nsuggestive of a foreigner, unfamiliar with the spelling of the names\nof Parisian buildings.  The Swiss would be of interest to English\nreaders because Henry VIII had in 1521 asked the Cantons for leave to\nenlist Swiss in his service.  The Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve procession is\ndescribed in a letter of la Marquise de\nS\u00e9vign\u00e9.", "2": "[Full Text of the Letter.] Such enewes as we haue here in Parrys I have sent you, As touchinge\nsuche as of late hathe chaunced emonges vs. Pleasith itt you to be\naduertised that nott withstandinge the severe iustice whiche of late\nhathe been executed vpon thise Antechristes, which, besyd many\nerronyouse opynyons, soo blasphemously oppugneth the mooste blessed\nsacrament of the aulter, There was within thise fewe dayes by the\nstretes of parrys scateryd bookes whiche was Intitled PARANTIPHRASYN scilicet, a right prouffitable\nIntreatise concernynge the Sacrament of the aulter, Wherein, as they\nsay, were scasely soo many sentences as blasphemyes contrary to the\nsaid sacrament.

Wherupon the xxiti day of this monethe of\nJanuary be comaunded a generall procession to be maade by the hole\nCitie and the vnyuersitie of Parrys, In whiche this was thordre: ffirste , the sherive of saint Genouefes, whiche is neuer doon\nwithout grette and vrgent causes, accompayned with dyuers parishes\nwith suche reliques as they hadd brought, vpon xxiti mennys backes\nbare foted and all naked savinge their shirtes, to notre Dames with\nthe Cathedrall chirche, Thabbott and the monkes folowinge bare foted\ndeuoutely sayinge and synginge, and with them came the Jacobyns to the said chirche, where was gathered togydre\nthe thre other ordres, with other religiouse houses and curates of\nchirches with suche reliques as euery man hadde, taryinge their\ncomynge. This doon , they all ther assemblede, with Canons and with the\nCathedrall quere with other reliques, as of saint James, Philipp,\nMarcell, barbara, Genouefa, etc., went to saint Germayns nere to the\nkynges Palice named the Lower.  Thidre was brought reliques of the\nkynge his chappell, namely the holy crosse, the crowne of thorne.  To\nthe whiche place the kynge, the quene, the dolffyn, with other his\nsonnes and doughters, the prynces, and nobles of his courte, came from\nthens, and soo returned , all in ordre, to notre Dames before named; ffirste, was the cordelyars, in nombre to my Judgement V, and in\nthe latter ende of them came the quene on horse backe, accompayned\nwith twoo of the kynges doughters and Lx or above of ladies decked all\nafter the ffrenche ffashion in mooste goodlieste wise, until they came\ndirectly before the chirche, where the quene alighted and taryed the\ncomynge of the kynge in a house provided for hir. After the Cordelyars came the Jacobyns, as many in nombre as the\nother. Consequently, the Augustynnes, Carmes, monkes, religiouse men,\nCurates of parishes, lycentiattes, and doctoures (noo other I will\nreherse here, for the nombre is in maner infynyte), With tapers euery\nman in their handes, and suche notable reliques as thay hadd. Hereafter folowed the monkes of saint Genoveffes of the oon syde of\nthe streate, and of saint Marcelles of the other syde. After them came the sherives of bothe thise saintes, oon againste a\nnother, caryinge as I declared before. After them came the Canons and quere of the kynges chappell and\ncathdrall chirche. And after them came the sweffes euery man with his Javelinge in his\nhande. Then folowes them the gentilmen of the courte. And after them came v. or vi. busshoppes, iiii.  cardynalles, with\nother grette men of the courte spirituell, beringe also certayne\nreliques.

And after hym, in that parte, the prynces and other nobles of the\ncourte; and in the right hande, the prymour presydent of the\nparliament, whome folowed the counsaile[r]s of the same, with other of\nother places of Justice, and all those in scarlett.  And in the\nmyddest of thise twoo, strayte after the kynge came Lx or above of\nnoble men, with torches as he didd.  The reason wherefore he putt the\nparliament on his right hande was to signyfie that he wolde preferre\nJustice above any creature lyvinge were he neuer soo noble or dere\nbeloved to hym. Then folowed the mayour of the towne, with his officers and\nAldermen. And after them the kynges garde, and the garde of the towne with\nhawberdes in their handes and stavis. And as for the multytude of comyns that were there, I cannott\nnombre. And whenne the kynge came before the chirche, the quene (beinge\ncaryed betwixt iiij. men in hir chayre), with the kynges doughters,\nfolowed hym into the chirche, where was a solempne masse songe,\nsemblablement as itt is vpon Corpus christi daye.  What highe\nsolemnyte was doon ther, itt was nott possible to entre to see. And as the kynge passed before the chambre that I stode in the\npeople whiche stode in the streate, laudynge the kynge as he was\nmooste worthieste for this noble acte, cryed to hym Sir, do good Justice!  Whome,\nwith lovinge countenaunce, he badde to be content, as who wolde saye\nthat they shulde nott nede to feare that.

This ye\nmay boldely affyrme for itt is nothinge butt truthe, with muche more\nwhiche for lacke of leasur I have omytted. Moreover, after dyner , whiche was in the busshoppe of parrys house,\nthe kynge declared in an Oracion to his nobles and counsailoures his\nfaithfull mynde towardes god, Rehersynge his benefites, and the long\ncontynuance of his roialme in the true faithe of christe, Mentyonynge\nalso that as his predecessoures were, nott without good cause, called\nmooste christian prynces, soo he trusted to ymploye his endevour that\nhis name shall not decaye or be loste by hym, Exhortynge and\nrequyrynge them all, bothe spirituall and temporall, euery man for his\nparte to doo the same, Addynge furdre that if he founde any to halte\nin this poynte he shulde suffre extreme iustice, alleginge this texte Si occulus tuus scandalizat te, erue et proijce eum abs te.
