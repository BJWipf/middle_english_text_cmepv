[Mr. James Gairdner, of the Record Office, tells me that 'Henry kynge of England, \u00fee frensh womman son,' can only mean Henry VI., born in 1421, son of Cathe|rine, daughter of Charles VI. of France. Henry's marriage with Margaret of Anjon, suggested by the Earl of Suffolk in 1444, took place in 1445. Mr. Gairdner therefore thinks the date of 1416 (the third of Henry V.) a mistake of the copier of the MS. In this Mr. G. E. Cokayne agrees, and would fix the date at 1436, believing that \"\u00fee frensh womman son\" would not have been used after her death, in 1438. But the difficulty is to settle what the Proclamation is intended to satirize. The possession of Jerusalem, Joppa, the Holy Rood, etc., the being Souden of Surre or Syria, and the like, point to the Sultan. The Porter of Paradise, the Cousin of Christ, the opposition to Lollardy, might have been thought to hint at the Pope, if the marriages (unless allegorical ones are alluded to) did not prevent that. Professor Brewer suggests Anti|christ, that is, the representative of the Antichristian powers. The allusion to Lollardy may point to Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham's rising, for which he was executed Dec. 25, 1417. \"Curiously enough, Henry III. was also King of England for some time during the lifetime of his mother, a French woman; \n  but of course the text could not apply to so early a date, besides that the taking away from the date is a greater sin than adding thereunto. I am inclined to think the whole thing a satire by the party of Cardinal Beaufort on the poverty of, and want of any real power in, Ren\u00e9, Duke of Anjou, titular King of Jerusalem, Sicily, Naples, Aragon, Valence, etc., etc., who had succeeded his brother Louis in all these and many other high-sounding titles in 1434, and was probably at that time displaying them to the utmost advantage in hopes of getting something more solid by so doing\u2014 which came to pass in 1444 and 1445 by the betrothal and subsequent marriage of his daughter Margaret with King Henry. Jerusalem, etc., were considered by Ren\u00e9 as belonging to him. Remember, too, this was before the conquest of the Eastern Empire in 1453. Constantinople was taken May 29, 1453, by Mahomet II., and Constantine XIII. (Pal\u00e6ologus) slain, with whom ended the Eastern Empire.\u2014 Haydn's Dict. of Dates . Of course Ren\u00e9's marriages do not apply. He married twice, but his first wife did not die till 1453. I have not time to go into the subject fully. Other points ought to be looked into\u2014viz., Henry VI. was in his 23rd year, wished by the Duke of Gloucester to marry a daughter of the Count of Armagnac. Who was he? Could he be meant? I do not think so, because at that time Catherine was dead, and probably Henry would not be spoken of as the son of the Frenchwoman, it being usual for English kings to marry French princesses, and every king (excepting Edward III.) having done so from John downwards, though some had English wives as well. In 1425 John Pal\u00e6ologus II. was Emperor of the East, till 1448. What sort of man was he? He had probably many titles and (titular) kingdoms, and little else. I have not time to pursue him, liking Ren\u00e9 better.\"\u2014G. E. C.]"}, "6": {"0": "Lydgate's Horse, Goose, and Sheep.", "1": "[Written after A.

After Henry V.'s marriage, he accompanied the king at his triumphal entry into Paris on Dec. 1, 1420. On Henry's departure for England at the end of Jan. 1421, Clarence was appointed Captain of Nor|mandy and Lieutenant of France in the king's absence. Soon after, he started on a raid thro' Maine and Anjou, and advanced as far as Beaufort-en-Vall\u00e9e, near the Loire. Meantime the Dauphin had collected his forces, and, being joind by a strong body of Scottish knights, reached Beaug\u00e9, in the English rear, on March 21. Clarence, on hearing the news, at once set out with his cavalry, not waiting for the main body of his army. He drove in the Scottish outposts, but was in his turn overwhelmed, and, together with many of the knights who accompanied him, was slain. His defeat was due to his own impatience, and his anxiety to win a victory which might compare with Agincourt. After his death the archers, under the Earl of Salisbury, came up and recovered the bodies of the slain (Cotton MS., Claud. A, viii., leaf 10 a ). Clarence's body was carried back to England, and buried at Canterbury.\u2014 Dict. Nat. Biog ., lvi., 158, 159. worthi ] LH, & worthy R.

(1897) of his edition of Chaucer's Works, pages li.-lv., 300-326, 517-520, and H.

Nichols, in his county history of Leicestershire, ii. 37, says that the Sir Richard Ros, who was presumably the poet, was born in 1429, and is known to have been alive in 1450, when he was 21 years old. The date of his englishing is probably about 1460. As the family of Roos or Ros were lords of Hamlake and Belvoir in N.E. Leicestershire, not far from Grantham in Lincolnshire, and Bourne, whence Robert of Brunne gets his name, Prof. Skeat (p. liii.) says there was something of a Northern element in Sir Richard's language, as shown by his ryme long\u00e8s with song\u00e8s in ll. 53-5, and his use of the Northern possessive pronoun their . This leaves little doubt that the Trinity manuscript's awn (ll. 455, 475, 608) for own\u2014which Prof. Skeat adopts, no doubt from Thynne\u2014is Sir Richard's own form of the word. The Harleian text of the poem, which I printed in our first issue of the Polit., Rel. and Love Poems , was copied from a MS. of which the leaves had been misplaced, as I found when comparing it with Chartier's French, at Prof. Skeat's request, on Jan. 21, 1895.
