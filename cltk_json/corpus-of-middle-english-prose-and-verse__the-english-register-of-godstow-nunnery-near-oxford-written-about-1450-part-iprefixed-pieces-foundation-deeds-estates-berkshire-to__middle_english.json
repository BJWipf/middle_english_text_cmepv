I haue not loued hym and dred as I shuld, Neither serued hym in kepyng myne holyday; But rather to playes and Iapes y wolde, Then to serue god, rede, syng, or pray. Al \u00fee circumstaunce y can not say, So synful y am and so vnstable, For my defautes ben innumerable. My fader and moder I haue not obeyed, As y shuld haue done, with helpe or mekenesse.

Alas! al my life is ful of vices. And my fyue wyttes I haue ofte myspend; To many vanytes castyng my syght, And with my heeryng ful ofte y offend; My smellyng, my tastyng, I spend not ryght; My handes to synne haue ben ful light. Thus haue I gouerned my wittes fyve, And in synne mispended al my lyve. The werkes of mercy I haue not fulfilled, Aftir my power, as ofte as I myght. To helpe \u00fee pore I was not beste willed, With mete and drynke and clo\u00feing \u00feem dyght, &YOGH;euyng no herborogh a-dayes or nyght, Helpyng no prisoners, ne vysyting \u00fee seeke; To bery \u00fee dede I was not meke.

KNIGHTON, in Compton Beauchamp parish. [NOTE.\u2014Early in the history of the convent, Godstow's interest in this parish was forgotten, and consequently erroneous readings have crept in at most mentions of it in the Registers, both Latin and English. A branch of the St. Valerie family possessed considerable lands here. About 1200 Wido of St. Valerie (possibly a younger brother of Bernard) gave Godstow a rent-charge (nos. 16, 17) of 6s. 8d. over these lands to endow an obital service for his father. About 1225 Wido's \n  son, Reginald, sold his Knighton property to St. Frideswyde's priory (Wigram's Cartulary of St. Frideswide , 1896, ii. 297-306). The Rev. H. Salter has shown me that Mr. Wigram, following Dugdale, has assigned the sale to the great Reginald (died 1166), whereas the conveyance is dated 'in die Translacionis B. Thome Martiris,' and cannot therefore be earlier than 1224. In 1286, in an exchange of rent-charges over each other's property, Godstow (no. 509) gave up this Knighton rent-charge to St. Frideswyde's priory. The service for the founder's father was provided for by transferring the obligation to Godstow property in North Oxford, where, at the dissolution in 1540, we find this 6s. 8d. still charged ( Monasticon , iv. 370). When, some 150 years later, the compiler of the Latin Register transcribed the deeds about the obit, he could not make out the locality. He had recourse to two subterfuges. Two deeds (nos. 17 and 18), owing to the founder's name, he attached to St. Valerie donations elsewhere. A third (no. 16) he put into his un|identified set at the end, under Cniscetuna (for Cnigtetuna). In the general charters he has even wandered into Cumberton .] A Charter of Wyde of Seynt Walerye for half a marke [in] Cniscetun. About 1200.

[NOTE.\u2014Seuecurda, Seukeworth, Seckworth (Wood's City of Oxford , i. 325-8), and, more recently, Seacourt, was once a considerable village in Berkshire, between Wytham and North Hincksey, of which little now survives except the name (now pronounced 'Sec-urth' by Wytham folks). Its decay probably dates from the con|struction \n  of the Seven Bridges Road (formerly, Botley Causeway) which gave a more convenient access from Oxford across the many-streamed Thames valley to the road to Bath and the west. Before that, the route went north from Oxford through Walton for about a mile; then turned westward; crossed the main Thames at Binsey ford; and thence advanced across various branches of Thames by bridges, whose abutments remained till living memory, to Seukeworth, just south of the branch of Thames which parts Oxfordshire from Berkshire.\nThere is some confusion about the dates of the de Seukeworth family. Wood, basing his judgement on Brian Twyne's excerpts, assumed that William of Seuke|worth gave the tithe of his mills (no. 25) to Godstow at the foundation, in 1138/9. This cannot be, since the first list in which the grant is mentioned is Henry II's second charter (no. 879), i.e. about 1165. The family descent seems to be\u2014Robert of Seukeworth, about 1140; William, about 1165; Robert, 1200; Sir William, 1230; Dionysia, 1260.\nThe church (no. 27), or chapel-of-ease, of Seukeworth was a benefaction of the family to Studley Priory in Oxfordshire.\nAt the dissolution, 1540, Godstow still owned ( Monast . iv. 375) a parcel of meadow called Secourt ham, valued at 3s. 4d. a year, and then reckoned to be in Wytham parish.] A chartur of William of Sewkeworth of the tythe of ij. myll & o\u00feer commodyteys in ye same. About 1165. Grant to Godstow, by William of Sewke|worth, as a nun's dower, of the tithes of two mills there, and grant of five acres of meadow. Also con|firmation of his (step?) son's gift of Easington church (no. 438) with land and tithe in Easington. THE sentence of thys chartur is, that William of Sewekeworth willith to be know that he grauntyd & gaf to god & to our lady seynt Marye, & to the churche of Godstowe, & to the holy mynchyns there seruinge god, for the helthe of hys sowle, & of hys chyldyrn, & of hys aunceters, with hys wyfe also, the whyche he toke 'Take' is used as equivalent to 'give.'

[NOTE.\u2014The mills of which the tithes were given by the father (no. 25) were corn-mills (the Latin having 'in bladis et nummis et piscibus'). These, in the son's gift, must be different, being fulling-mills for the felting of woollen-cloth ('decimas duorum molendinorum meorum fuleree in Seuecordia').] Grant by William, lord of Seuekeworthe, to the church of St. Mary of Sewkeworth.

And is with-out date. [NOTE.\u2014I take this conduit to be for the supply of drinking water to the nunnery. Somewhere beyond the village of Wytham, a reservoir seems to have been con|structed to catch one of the springs which gush out of the foot of the Berkshire \n  hills. Mr. H. Hurst points out the difficulty of supposing engineers at that date to be capable of conducting a stream of water under the branches of Thames which lie between Wytham and Godstow. But Oseney Abbey (Wood's City of Oxford , ii. 205) was supplied by a reservoir at North Hincksey, and portions of the lead-pipe (enclosed in stone), by which the water was conveyed across the Thames valley and probably under the streams, have been dug up in modern times. Otho Nicholson's conduit (Wood, i. 441) at Carfax, built in 1610, of which the reservoir|house still stands on the slope of Hincksey hill, is a later and more famous example. Mr. Hurst has drawn my attention to a remarkable work to supply the tanks within the nunnery enclosure and the large fishponds outside. To the west of Godstow there is a small, winding branch of Thames, called 'Wytham brook.' From this, by a straight artificial canal, a stream of water was led along most of the west side of the gardens, parallel to the convent. When near the south-west corner, this canal turned sharply eastwards, was brought under the west wall by a fourteenth|century arch (which still remains), formed within the court two largish baths or ponds, passed through the east wall by an arch, no doubt fed the fishponds (which had one arm 65 yards by 9 yards, another 23 yards by 8 yards, both of about 4 feet deep: all filled up in 1887) which lay just south of the convent; and thence escaped to the Thames by a channel which was filled up in 1885. This was called the 'Sanctuary Stream.' The field enclosed between this stream on the west and the convent buildings on the east is called 'Sanctuary Field'; that west of it is called 'Sentry Field,' probably from memory of the 1645-6 campaigns. At the point where Sanctuary stream leaves Wytham brook, an elm-tree was blown down in 1899. The cattle, trampling over the spot, brought out the foundations of a rectangular building which had no doubt been erected to keep the water in the canal at a just level. Mr. Hurst, who made the discovery, thinks that this is the 'head' described in no. 28. I do not agree, for I cannot find here any 'arable land,' for the crossing of which (nos. 28, 29) permission had to be obtained. I must, how|ever, add that Mr. Hurst opines that the levels of the water round Godstow have been greatly altered, and that lands now meadow may have been formerly plowable.] [Dispute about tithe at Wytham.] A chartur I-made by dyuers iuggys a-geynst \u00fe e person of wyhtham. 1244/5, Febr. 13. Commis|sioners appointed by pope GregoryIX, March 27, 1241, to determine a tithe-suit. Robert, parson of Wytham, claimed tithes of a croft in Wytham, and arrears for six years.

[NOTE.\u2014This deed means the institution of, and the setting the stipend of, a permanent chaplain to perform the duties of the church, for an absentee rector. The Latin has 'scilicet altar. cum omnibus oblationibus et diversis ad altare pertinentibus et decimam lini cum decimis minutis argenti cum medietate digesarum (?).' The small tithe of silver probably means the halfpennies and pence paid as tithe of the increase of cattle. Dr. John Cowell's The Interpreter (1637), under the head Tithe says:\u2014'Wherefore those customes of paying a halfe penny for a Lambe, or a penny for a Calfe, by such as have under seven in one yeare, how long soever it hath indured, is but very unreasonable in these dayes, when both Lambes and Calves are growne foure times dearer, and more then they were when this price was first accepted. And therefore no man dischargeth well his conscience in this point that payeth not duly the tenth of every Lambe, every Calfe, and every other thing titheable.' See also in no. 871. The deed is headed in the Latin Canteria ecclesiae de Bloxham , and the witnesses are Walter, archdeacon of Oxford; Jeffrey, Nicholas, and Roger, chaplains of the king; and Gowin, dean [? rural dean of Deddington].

LANGFORD. [NOTE.\u2014The parish of Langford is of exceptional interest. It is now reckoned as being in the county of Oxford, but part of it was formerly reckoned as being in Berkshire. It represents, therefore, the debateable land where the two kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia pushed each other backwards and forwards, and the land sometimes was in the Wessex see of Salisbury, at other times in the Mercian see of Lincoln. In Monast . vi. 1276 is printed a charter of Henry II conferring on Lincoln Minster 'the church of Langeford and all the land which Roger, bishop of Sarum (died 1139, Dec. 4), held in that vill,' on the petition of Robert (de Chesney), bishop of Lincoln (1147-68). Two prebends, 'Langford ecclesia' and 'Langford manor,' were endowed from this source. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are now the lay impropriators of the parish. The three earliest of the following deeds belong to the time of that endowment. Unfortunately the record is incomplete, by the excision of the second leaf of this section, a loss which is not made good by the still more mutilated Exchequer MS. It appears that bishop Robert, before conveying the estate to Lincoln Minster, took out a messuage and half a hide of land which he granted, at 12d. yearly quit|rent, to one of his serfs, Jeffrey son of Fowke, and which he had formerly granted to Jeffrey's brother, Robert (probably since deceased). At a later period we find these lands placed under feoffees, as though to found a chantry, but the documents are not brought to a definite conclusion. I have inquired at Langford and found no tradition of Godstow having owned lands there, but a conjecture is hazarded that the chantry may have been connected with a chapel at the celebrated Radcott bridge Battle of Radcott bridge, Dec. 20, 1387. in Langford.] A ratificacion of the Chapiter of our lady of lyncolne of the forsaid Not of the grant in no. 467 (which precedes this in the MS.), but of an earlier one, not here given. yifte, yoven by the Bisshoppe as is aforesaid.

[NOTE.\u2014Although the deeds relating to Godstow property in Oxford are numerous, the estate of the convent there was comparatively unimportant, except in the extra|mural district of Walton and St. Giles. In Oxford proper the holdings were mostly pre-occupied by the older and greater foundations of St. Frideswyde's and Oseney; and Godstow had also to meet the competition of other religious houses near Oxford, as the Hospitals of St. Bartholomew and of St. John the Baptist, Abingdon Abbey, Einsham Abbey, Rewley Abbey, Studley Priory. The compiler of the Latin Register arranged these deeds roughly by parishes. They have now been brought more strictly into order, and the extra-parochial deeds put by themselves in three sets:\u2014 1. The deeds concerned with the controversy about tithes in the north suburb of Oxford between Godstow as rector of St. Giles's church and Oseney as rector of St. George's in the castle. \n  2. The deeds concerned with the exchanges of land and quit-rents between Godstow and St. Frideswyde's priory. 3.

[NOTE.\u2014A conjecture may be hazarded as to the source from which the money for the preceding purchase came, and the purpose to which the income so secured was to be applied.\nAt the dissolution, in 1540, we find ( Monast . iv. 370) Godstow lands charged with \u00a31 5s. yearly to provide a pittance on the anniversary of Ela (de Longesp\u00e9e), countess of Warwick, and also with \u00a37 7s. to be spent in almsgiving and in the salaries of two chaplains to say mass in Godstow chapel for the same countess. There is nowhere any mention of endowment supplied by her to meet these charges. Since she died in 1297, it is possible that about 1290 she advanced money to provide such endowment, and that 'Middleton Hall' in St. Giles was purchased out of that fund.] [8.

[NOTE.\u2014Godstow held tithe in Rollright prior to pope Eugenius III's confirmation (no. 901) in 1145, and so probably of the gift of Thurstan, 'dispensator' to Henry II. His son Thomas, who is mentioned in the first deed following, was apparently rector of Rollright. This tithe seems lost or alienated before the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of pope Nicholas IV in 1291.] An amycable composicion bitwene the Abbesse of Godestowe and Thomas fit&yogh; Turstyne, vpon the Tythes of the Demaynes of Rollendrith, & cetera.

THE sentence of this frendly composicion is, that ther was a contrauersie I-meved bitwene the Abbesse of Godestowe and Thomas fit&yogh; Turstyne, vpon the tythes of the demayn of Rollen|drith: at the last hit was accorded in this wyse, \u00feat is to sey, \n  that the forsaid Thomas and his successours shold pay to \u00fee chirch of Godestowe euery yere viij. shillings of the forsaid chirch of Rollendrith in the name of the forsaid tythes, in the fest of seynt Mighell; so, that is to sey, \u00feat the chirch of Godestowe by the occasion of the forsaid rent shold neuer have no chalenge of right in the forsaid chirch.

[NOTE.\u2014This document seems to provide a hitherto unknown abbess about the beginning of the list. It begins: 'Sciant ... quod Agnes abbatissa de Godestowe.' The witnesses (Exchequer MS., leaf 140) are Godfrey, abbot of Eynsham (1152-96), Philip, prior of St. Frideswyde's (1180-92), Richard, deputy archdeacon of Oxford (1186 onwards), and Luke, janitor of Godstow. The agreement was reached 'in sinodo Oxon,' i. e. the annual meeting of the clergy of the arch|deaconry of Oxford. Rev. H. Salter points out the interesting fact that the monk of Eynsham, in his vision at Easter 1196, saw in mild torments a venerable abbess 'of a neighbouring convent,' who had died 'presenti anno' (April 1195-April 1196). This must be Godstow, since Littlemore and Studley were under prioresses. Probably, therefore, we have, in 1195, the death of this Agnes.] A-nother Charter of Turstan the kyngis boteler confermyng to the mynchons of Godestowe the forsaid viij. shillings. 1234, Nov. 29.

A sum of 7d. was paid to the Prince of Wales, as Earl of Cornwall, as due to his court of Bensington.] A Charter of kynge Stephyn, I-made to the mynchons of Godestowe, for ij. hydis of lond and an half and half a yerd of londe in Shillyngforde.

Salter gives me the history of Watlington. In 1166 it was owned by Halinad de Bidun. Afterwards, by William Paganell (Paynel) and his wife Sara (Halinad's daughter). On William's death King John gave it to Peter son of Herbert. A claim for it by Henry de Oylly was compromised (circ. 1218) by Peter's consenting to hold it of Henry. In 1223 Henry III took it into his own hands, saying that neither Peter nor de Oylly had any right to it: Maitland's Bracton , iii. 336, 463. The mill was, perhaps, taken back at that time with the manor.] WOLVERCOTE.

Elderly men tell me that, in their boy|hood, the wheat-crops were much infested by darnel ( lolium temulentum ). When the wheat was thrashed, each sheaf, before it was passed to the thresher, was taken in hand by a boy, who pulled out the darnel-heads. If this was not done, the miller either refused to buy the wheat, or gave a very small price for it.] Chartur of \u00fee tithe of \u00fee hey of Eton. 1296, May 3.

WAS FIRST SENT TO PRESS PIDDLE ATHELAMPSTON, DORSETSHIRE Charter for 20s. rent in Adelinkton. About 1145. Grant to Godstow, by Muriel de Bohun, of a rent|charge, to found an obit. MURIELLA de Boun gave 20s. rent in Adelinkton, viz. in Dereseth, which William son of Bricher used to pay to her, to be paid to the kitchen on her anniversary. Witnesses: Herbert, chaplain and keeper of Godstow; James, steward of Godstow; Magister Rogerus Glovernia. [NOTE.\u2014Identification supplied by Rev. H. E. Salter. In 1200 the bishop of Salisbury held, as two knights' fees, five small manors, viz. Prinnesley, Piddle Athelampston, and three others. At an earlier date Muriella de Bohun, wife of Ralph de Bruere, occurs as giving away land in Prinnesley (Hutchins's History of Dorset , iv. 298.] BALDON and BROAD-ENSTONE, OXFORDSHIRE Charter of Thurstan, dispensator of the king of England. 1234, Nov. 29. Grant to Godstow, by Thurstan Despencer, of a rent|charge, to endow an obit on Sept. 9 for his son Amalric. THURSTAN Despencer, with the consent of his wife Lucy, gave to Godstow 5s. of yearly rent for the soul of Amauri his son, viz. 3s. to be taken of his men of Bradenston and his fee in that vill with the homages, and 2s. in Baldindon from Andrew of the chequer, to provide a pittance on the morrow of the Nativity of the Virgin, i. e. on the anniversary of Aumari his son. Witnesses: Ralph Despencer, parson; Adam Despencer, knight; Absalom and Bernard, chaplains; Gilebert of Biham; Reoland Bluet. Eve of St. Andrew, 1234: at Godstow. [NOTE.\u2014Rev. H. E. Salter identifies both places for me. Baldindon is Baldon, Oxfordshire, where the Despencers had a manor of six hides. Broad-enstone is a hamlet, in Enstone parish, Oxfordshire, which was held, by the Despencers, of the Abbot of Winchcombe.] COMBE MYLLE. [NOTE.\u2014The mention of the bishop of Lincoln suggests that this place was in that diocese, and it has been therefore assumed to be Combe Longa by Woodstock in Oxfordshire. The witnesses (Exchequer MS. leaf 183, back) supply no clue to the locality, being Hugh, chaplain; Ralf of Monemut. (i. e. Monmouth: Canon of Lincoln, circ. 1150-80); Sayer of Quincey; Fulk Trussell, &c. The date is also fixed by the absence of the property from pope Eugenius III's confirmation, 1145, and from Henry II's first confirmation, 1156, and its presence in Henry II's second confirmation (no. 879), 1165. Against the identification with Combe Longa is the fact that the manor of Combe Longa was in the King's hands from 1154 on|wards; so that its miller, in making his grant, would have appealed to the King, his overlord, not to the bishop. The extant accounts of the manor (in Public Records Office) are not early enough to help us. Rev. S. Spencer Pearce, Vicar of Combe, tells me that there is no mention of the mill in the accounts 1243-99, but in those of 1304-11 it is plainly in the King's own hands.] A Charter of Norbert for the mylle of Combe I-made to the holy mynchons of Godestowe. About 1160. Norbert, donor of the mill to Godstow, asks the bishop of Lincoln, Robert (de Chesney), bishop 1147-68), to effect his purpose. THE sentence of this Charter is, that Norbert willed to be know to the Robert Bisshop of lyncolne fadirhode and to all trew cristen peple of the chirche, that he, for the helthe of his sowle, yaf and graunted into perpetuell almesse, to god and to the chirche of oure lady of Godestowe and to the holy mynchons there seruyng god, his mylle of Combe with all that longith therto. Wherfor he besily praied his hyghnesse that he wold maynteyn and defende the same holy mynchons, for the love of god, in the same almesse. These beyng witnesse, & cetera. HORSEFORD, IN NORFOLK. [NOTE.\u2014Among the witnesses are Walter and Jordan, chaplains, and Walter Maleth. Herring were cured at the fishing-port. Oseney, e.g., Rev. H. E. Salter tells me, had tenements at Dunwich and at Yarmouth for the supply of herrings. Margaret, wife of Hugh de Cressi, in 1175 inherited Horseford manor from her father William de Chesney. It had belonged to the family since 1086 (Blomefield's History of Norfolk , x. 433).] A Charter of Margery Cressy, I-made to the mynchons of Godestowe, for v. cartlode of wode of aldur of her wode I-called horforde, xv. dayes after myghelmasse yerely to be take, to dry ther heryng. About 1180. Grant to Godstow, by Margery Cressy, widow, of wood at Michael|mas to dry their herring. THE sentence of this charter is, that Margery Cressy, in her fre wedowhode, for goddis sake and for the helth of her \n  sowle and of the sowles of her fadir and modir and of her aunceturs and successours, graunted, & cetera, into pure and perpetuel almesse, to god & cetera and to the mynchons of Godestowe ther seruyng god, v. cartlode of wode of Aldur 'de alno in bosco meo de Horsford' in the Latin. in her wode I-called horford to be take by yere, that is to sey, xv. dayes after myghelmasse, to drye there heryng 'ad suum allec siccandum': herring being then in the midst of their season. The nuns probably bought a considerable quan|tity to dry for winter use. Herrings were brought up the Thames in barges, and, during Lent, Abingdon Abbey claimed toll of each barge so laden (Wood's City of Oxford , i. 427). . And that this her graunte, & cetera. HUMESWORTH OR HINNESWORTH. Charter of Peter of Brumelingham for the mill of Humesworth. About 1160? Grant to Godstow, by Peter of Brumelingham of a mill and a rent-charge. PETER and his wife Felicia, gave, with their daughter to be a nun, their mill of Humesworth Writing indistinct: possibly 'Hinnes|worth.' See Highworth mill, in no. 886 \u00a7 59. and 2s. of rent at Hespes. Witnesses:\u2014Wacheline, abbot of Abingdon; Nicholas, monk of Evesham; Magister Roger and his nephew Simon; and the donor's sons William and Hugh. PETHAM, IN KENT. Charter of Alan de Leia for 5 acres in perpetual alms. About 1190. Grant to Godstow, by Alan of Leigh, of five acres in Petham, in exchange for a rent|charge. ALAN of Leigh lets all men, French and English, know, that with his daughter Amphelisia to be a nun, he has given to Godstow, with consent of his son and heir Roger, five acres which lie above the house of the parson of St. Peter of Far|ningeham on the east, which acres belonged to the mill of Farningeham, and which Godfrey son of Godwin of the bridge held of him in exchange for that half-marc of rent This rent-charge, given by Alan of Leigh, is found in Henry II's third charter (no. 886), 1182. which Richard of Grai used to pay to the nuns in the tenure of Putham, \n  as he has held the land, or as his lord William of Einesford held it who gave that land to him with his sister Maud in free marriage (in libero matrimonio). Witnesses:\u2014William, dean of Wortun (? Horton); Elias, cleric of Einesford; Thomas, nephew of Agnes the abbess: at Einesford. [NOTE.\u2014Rev. H. E. Salter happily identifies these places. Horton-Kirby, Farning|ham (church dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul), and Eynsford are adjacent parishes, south of Dartford in Kent. Petham is a small manor in Farningham parish (Hasted's History of Kent , i. 300).] VLEBERNE. Grant of the advowson of the church with all its pertinents. 1234, Nov. 29. Grant to Godstow, by Thurstan Despencer, of the ad|vowson of Vleberne, to found two obits. THURSTAN, dispensator domini regis Anglie, with the wish of his mother Alde Bluet and of his wife Lucy, granted to Godstow the jus patronatus of the church of Vleberne Ewelme, Oxfordshire, is the only De|spencer advowson in the Testa , 1240, which is at all like Vleberne (or Uleberne).

And hit shall be lawfull to yow to resceive fre persones and lowsid fleyng fro the worlde to conuersion, and to holde theyme, with-oute ony agayne-seiyng.

And whan that ther is a generall 'for generall enterdityng,' in margin. entirdityng I-made, Hit shold be lawfull to them, the yates I-shitte, cursed peple I-excluded or I-shitte oute The second participle is (as is frequent with the translator) an alternative render|ing of the Latin word. The clause runs: 'persons excommunicate and interdicted being shut out.' , and also suche as be entirdited, \n  the belles [not Added from the Latin. ] I-ronge, with In the Latin: 'suppressa voce celebrate divina officia.' lowe voice to sey goddis service.

Also he confermed by his auctorite the liberteis and the immynumentis In the Latin is 'immunitates.' the whiche somtyme Alisaundre, bisshoppe of Lyncolne, resonably yaf, with the consente of the Archidekon, to ther monastery, with good deuocion, vppon hospitaliteis not to be asked of the Archidekon of the place, Chapeleyns and other mynystres wrongfully to be impleyd nother to be com|pellyd to go to Seyne, as hit is I-conteyned in the autentikes of the forsaid Bisshoppe, and hidir to be ordre. And whan the abbesse at that tyme of that place, or 'for to chese the abbesse of the same place,' in margin. ony of theyme that succede, [died] none shold be made abbesse there by ony wylynesse of surrepcion or violence but suche one which the Sustirs, with the commune assente, or the more parte of the sad counseille of Sustern, aftir the love of god and the rewle of Seynt Benette prouide to be chose. Also, he willyng with his fadirly besynesse to prouide to pease and rest fro that tyme forthe, forbede, by his auctorite of the appostles, that no man with-in the closyng of ther howses or graungis do violence or Rauysshynge or theft, sette to fire, take man or sle, or frowardely be bolde to do violence. Ther|for (or 'Marke wele,' in margin. for these causes) decreid that hit shold not be lawfull to no man vttirly to trouble the forsaid monastery frowardly, or to take away theire possessions, to with-hold them I-take \n  away to lessen them or to vexe them with ony vexacions but that they shold be keped hole for theire sustenaunce and gouernynge for the which they were I-graunted to profite in all manere vsis, Savyng the auctorite of the pope and the reguler right of the diocesane Bisshoppe. And yf ony in the tyme to come, of the Chirche or of the seculer parte, knowyng this his writyng, tempte frowardely to come or do ayenst hit twyes or thries I-warned, but he correcte his gilte with dew satis|faccion, he shold lakke or be depreved of his dignyte, worshippe, and powere, and know hym to be Iugged of god for that his wikkednesse that he did, And that he stondith departed fro the most holy body and blode of god and of oure agayne-byere Ihesu crist, and be subiected to streight vengeaunce in the last dome. And all this is no more to sey after my symplenesse, but that suche persones bene accursed. And he wolde that the pease of oure lord Ihesu crist shold be, to all kepyng of the same place theire rightis, that is to sey, they shold have cristis blissyng, that they doyng so myght take the frute of ther good doyng and to fynde the rewardes of everlastyng pease at the streight Iuggement.

Bull of pope Boniface IX (el. 1389, Nov. 2; died 1404, Oct. 1), empower|ing God|stow to lease out, give, or sell, the yearly proceeds of their different possessions, without obtaining licence of the ordin|ary, and in spite of pro|visions of the canon law. No papal decree hereafter obtained by any bishop is to be of power to annul this grant, unless the revocation expressly recites the grant and expressly repeals it. THE sentence of this confirmacion is, that Boneface, bisshop, servaunte of the seruantis of god, willed to be know to a per|petuell myndyng or memorie, that al so ofte as hit was I-asked of hym that was accordyng (or semed to acorde) to the holy religion and honeste, he graunted and thought to graunte with a good wille and to graunte to the desiris of the askers con|venyent helpe. This was the cause that he inclyned to the supplicacions of his welbeloued in crist the abbesse of Godestowe and of the Couente of the same monastery of the ordire of Seynt Benette of Lyncolne Diocise in this behalf, that they myght lawfully and frely arendre, sette to ferme, yeve or selle, all frutis, rentis, prouentis, tythis, and offeryngis of chirches, chapelles, porcions, pensions, and of othere possessions longyng \n  then to them and to there monastery or afterward to be longed The Latin is: 'in posterum spectan|dorum, clericis sive laicis, coniunctim vel divisim, prout ipsis videbitur expediens, et eciam antequam huiusmodi fructus, reddi|tus, et proventus decimarum, porciones, ac pensiones a solo vel a novem partibus sepa|rentur seu oblaciones offerantur, arrendare, locare,' &c. , to clerkes or to laye men, Ioyntly or departyngly, as hit semyth best to them, and also afore or 'Afore or' = before that. these manere of frutis, rentis, prouentis, porcions of tythes, and pensions, they were departed fro the grounde or the nyne parties i.e. before the tenth (tithe) sheave is brought into the tithe-barn, or even separ|ated from the shocks in the field. . And also to the forsaid clerkis or Layemen, that they myght gadre the frutis, rentis, prouentis, tythes, pensions, porcions, and resceive them to ferme, and put theyme in Clerkes grounde or Layemennes frely and lawfully, and dispose of them after ther owne lust and wille, By the auctorite he yaf licence by the tenoure of this present writyngis, no licence of the ordinaries or of ony othere requysite or gete, Notwithstondyng statutis of the forsaide ordre contrary, And also legatinis of Othon and Octobon and Synodall and other constitucions strengthed by the pope or by ony other suerte. And yf hit happened that his worshipfulle brothere, Bisshoppe of Lyncolne beyng for the tyme, or ony other, wold gete lettres of the pope or of his legatis ayenst this manere of graunte, or happened in tyme to be in generall or in speciall, hit shold not be of no strengthe nor of surete but mension were had in them of these present lettres fulle and expressed and fro worde to worde, decreyng, fro that tyme, to be nought, and in vayne, yf hit happened to be attempted beside vpon these thyngis of MS.
