(Schottischer Dialect, Mundart von Aberdeen).", "1": "Aus der zweiten n\u00f6rdlichen Legendensammlung, der des schottischen National|dichters Barbour (von ihm noch im hohen Alter, gr\u00f6sstentheils nach der Legenda Aurea gedichtet), theile ich hier vorl\u00e4ufig das wichtigste St\u00fcck mit: die Legende von Machor oder Moris, welche, da eine lateinische vita dieses Heiligen bis jetzt nicht aufgefunden ist, selbst die Stelle der Quelle vertritt. Die Zeit dieses Heiligen, der als Kind Mocumba (oder Mocumma) hiess, von seinem Lehrer Colman den Namen Machor empfing (vgl. v. 475), endlich vom Pabst bei seiner Ernenunng zum Bischof von Aberdeen Moris genannt wurde (vgl. v. 1465), sowie seines Lehrers S. Colman und seines Zeitgenossen S. Devenick, des Apostels von Cathnes (seine Be|gegnung mit Machor s. v. 819 ff., sein Tod v. 1339 ff), ist in Dunkel geh\u00fcllt Die schott. Annalisten setzen den Tod Dewenicks um 887, in die Regierung des Soluathius (Selvach); aber die K\u00f6nige dieses Stammes lebten im 8. Jahrh. Wahrscheinlich geh\u00f6ren diese Heiligen ins 6. Jahrh.; vgl. A Dictionary of christian biography, litterature, sects and doctrines ed. by Will. Smith and Henry Wace, London 1877, vol. I A \u2014 D (s. v. Devenick), wo als H\u00fclfs|mittel aufgef\u00fchrt sind: Forbes Kalend. of Scott. Saints, Boethius Scott. Hist. B. IX, Dempster Hist. Eccles. Gent. Scot. I, Camerarius De Scot. Fort., King Calendar.; ausserdem Breviarium Aberdon. ). Die einzige Hs., Ms. Cbr. Gg. II, 6, c. 1450, von verschiedenen H\u00e4nden ge|schrieben, ist \u00fcberaus schwer lesbar. In Machor fehlt leider ein Blatt nach v. 1014 zu 81 Versen. Bei v. 828 tritt eine andere Hand ein, vielleicht dieselbe welche den Anfang des Ms. geschrieben; die Fortsetzung scheint erst sp\u00e4ter nachgetragen, nach einer Notiz am Rande: Caret de fine sce Mauchcarii et de sca Katerina. Die Aufl\u00f6sung der zahlreichen Abk\u00fcrzungen des Ms. ist nach der sonstigen Schreib|weise des Ms. zu regeln. Das sonst er bezeichnende H\u00e4kchen kann durch er und ir yr ( ire yre ) und r wiedergegeben werden, bezeichnet aber in M tine, \u00fe u. q ar (q = quar oder quhare), h ist hir oder hyr hyre. Obengeschriebenes t vertritt sowohl die schottische Schreibung cht in nicht, nocht, als auch th in blyth swyth, endlich auch die Endung it yt in louit 87, sperit 505, 585. Der Strich \u00fcber den Vokalen, wie in n&amacr;, m&amacr;, bedeutet me oder ne ; ist ne ; oft findet sich und Strich zusammen: da ist wohl nur durch e aufzu|l\u00f6sen (vielleicht ist aber so durch sovne zu geben). able mit Schleife ist abile. p mit durchgezogenem Strich kann par (z.

Erkenwald tauft einen Leichnam). aus Ms. Harl. 2250, fol. 72b. (Westn\u00f6rdl. Dialect.)", "1": "In halt. Bald nach der Bekehrung der Sachsen durch S. Augustin wird beim Neubau des \"S. Paul's M\u00fcnsters\", des alten Heidentempels \"Triapolitan\", in London, dem \"neuen Troja\" der Heidenzeit, ein wundersch\u00f6nes steinernes Grab gefunden, mit seltsamen goldenen Zeichen geziert, die Niemand lesen kann. Auf die Kunde hiervon str\u00f6mt ganz London herbei. Der Maire befiehlt das Grab zu \u00f6ffnen: da findet man einen Leichnam, k\u00f6niglich geschm\u00fcckt, in reichem goldums\u00e4umten Gewande, mit Krone und Scepter, und, seltsam, alles unversehrt, den Leichnam noch rosig und frisch wie schlafend. Aber Niemand kennt ihn, der doch erst vor kurzem gestorben scheint. Der Fund wird dem Bischofe Londons, S. Erkenwald, der gerade zur Visi|tation einer Abtei in Essex weilt, gemeldet. Er eilt herbei, schliesst das Grab ab und verbringt die Nacht im Gebet zu Gott, das Geheimniss zu l\u00f6sen. Am andern Morgen singt er das Hochamt vor allem Volke und geht dann zum Grabe. Der Dechant berichtet wie man vergeblich 7 Tage lang die Todtenregister durchsucht, um &umacr;ber den Todten Auskunft zu finden; aber Erkenwald weist auf die Allmacht Gottes, der die R\u00e4thsel l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nne, tritt dann an den Leichnam und heisst ihn in Christi Namen sagen, wer er sei. Dieser antwortet, dass er kein Kaiser oder K\u00f6nig, sondern ein Richter im \"neuen Troja\" gewesen, vor vielen vielen Jahren, 1033 Jahre vor Chr. G., 482 Jahre nach Brutus' Erbauung der Stadt, unter der Regierung des Bretonenk\u00f6nigs Belin. Auf die Frage, warum er denn Krone und Scepter trage, antwortet er: weil er ein gerechter Richter gewesen, der nicht nach dem Ansehen der Person, nicht um Lohn oder Lob gerichtet, darum habe ihn das \"neue Troja\" k\u00f6niglich geehrt, als den K\u00f6nig der Richter. Der Bischof fragt ihn dann, warum sein Gewand, seine Farbe so frisch und unversehrt geblieben; er erwiedert, der himmlische K\u00f6nig der Gerech|tigkeit habe ihn so auszeichnen wollen, weil er Gerechtigkeit ge\u00fcbt. \"Aber wo ist deine Seele, wenn du so gerecht warst?\" Da st\u00f6hnt der Todte und spricht zu Gott: \"O m\u00e4chtiger Sch\u00f6pfer, wie konntest du deine Gnade mir zuwenden, da ich ein Heide, unkundig deines Gesetzes? Ach, ich geh\u00f6rte nicht zur Schaar der Erl\u00f6sten, da du zur H\u00f6lle fuhrst und sie befreitest! Da wohne ich noch, im Dunkel des Todes, weil die Taufe und der Glaube mich nicht geheiligt. Ach, was helfen mir nun meine guten Werke?\" Alle weinen, die das h\u00f6ren; der Bischof schluchzt lange, wortlos; endlich spricht er unter str\u00f6menden Thr\u00e4nen: \"Wollte Gott, dass du lebtest bis ich Wasser geholt und es auf dich aufgegossen mit den Worten: Ich taufe dich im Namen des Vaters, Sohnes und heil. Geistes!\" W\u00e4hrend er so spricht, siehe da tropfen die Thr\u00e4nen auf das Grab und eine f\u00e4llt auf des Todten Antlitz. \"Nun preise ich Gott\", so spricht er, \"und danke dir, o Bischof, da die Worte, die du gesprochen, und die Thr\u00e4ne, die du vergossen, meine Taufe geworden; ein himmlischer Lichtstrahl hat in den Abgrund geschienen und meine Seele emporgehoben, dass ich nun sitze am himmlischen Mahle\". Und pl\u00f6tzlich verstummt er, der Leichnam verweste, das eitle sterbliche Theil zerfiel.

His brothere Ruffyn of hym greate mar|vell hade. And as he wente, hym for to seeke, He mett haystely the harte so meyke That his brothere to the feythe lade And browght also to holy saynt Chade. There he founde his brothere, saynt Wolfade \u2014 Therof his harte then was full glade. The tolde hym all then of that casse, What-wisse saynt Wolfade cristened was. And, or he wente, god sende hym suche grace, That, or he wente, he was cristened in that place: Saynt Chade christenede hym hys owne hande, And hys brothere was hys godfathere, thus I vnderstonde. Saynt Chade went to masse then at hys awtere And howeslede them bothe there infere, And sett them bothe the feythe so sted|fastlye, That the were redy there-for to dye. So ferventhly in Criste there hartys were pyght, That no erthly thyng turne them myght; All worldely thyng the hade in despyte, And to be withe saynt Chade the hade gr(ea)te delyte. But he dwellyd so fare frome there fa|there place, That to cumme ofte to hym the myght ha(ue no) space. Therefore the besowght hym bothe infere There fathere castell he wolde dwell nere, That the myght haue withe hym ofte comunycacyone, So that there (fathe)re one them hade no suspecyone And spe\u00e7yall(y Wer)ebolde, that was there enmy, Whiche to t(hem hade) full greate envye And was ev (er busy), bothe dey and nyght, Howe he in (his dawn) gere bryng them myght. That tyme f(rom) . . . . .to Lyche|felde, I-wis, Was no tow(ne, but a)ll (w)yldenes. Saynt Chade (leyde his) Oratory then truwly Even into this countre here faste-by, Thre mylle the kyngys place fro, That the to hym myght ofte cumme and goe. In the whiche place, there as he made his dwellynge, Was greate plenty of trees then growyng, And of the burgenyng of the trees, the whiche there was, \"Borgen towne\" men callyde that place, And Borstone nowe hit callyde ys, There as saynt Wolfade was martyrede, I-wis. Saynt Wolfade and his brothere Ruffyn also Yche daye one huntyng feyned them to goe; To se saynt Chade, the were so fervente, That every dey ons to hym the wente. The kyng supposed, and his men ychone, That the every dey one huntyng had gone \u2014 But trewely ever-more there huntyng Was to serche for a more godly thyng: Yt was all to visett saynt Chade, I-wis, To brynge there sowllys to heven blysse. But this wickide Werebolde hade greate marvelynge For what casse the wente so ofte one huntynge. To them he hade full great envye And thowght he wolde them trewly espye, And tell there fathere, kyng Wolfere, Yf he myght owght cache them in his dawngere. So it befell vppon a daye, As the to saynt Chade shulde take the wey, As the were wonte ofte to do so: The falsse stewarde aftur them s. . . (ca)n goe, And as a pecoke wente a pre(ye?). . . . . l. preye? Till he came there, as saynt C(hade). . . . All that the dyde there, he can (espye) At an holle of the chapell. . . In his hart then was he (full feyne) That he hade bothe them (cawght in s) uche a trowne. Ms. trowne st. traine. He hyede hym faste to (king Wolfere) And tolde to hym howe his sonnes criste|nede were, And falssly one them there can he lye And seyde howe they the kyng dyde defye And howe the dyd reuerrance to the roode: And mayde the kynge for wrothe ny woode. So sore he hym sett his sonnes agayne, That he swore strongly the shulde be slayne. Werebolde sayde vnto the kynge: \"Syr, I tell you no lesynge. For, syr, yf thowe not beleve me, Cume thy-selfe, and thowe may se Howe thy sonnes ageynste the will the st. thi. A newe faythe haue taken them tyll, Whiche shall destroe the and all thy londe But if thow there malyce manfully with|stonde.\" The kyng, as the cronakle makythe men|cyone, Ms. By the. By kynde hade this dysposyscyone: That he was full of wrothe and anger also And cowlde not be satefyede, tyll it were ouer-go. The kyng toke his sworde and faste hym can hye, And swore a greate othe his sonnes shulde bothe dye. Werebolde there-of then was full feyne And stered hym thereto withe all his mayne, And browght hym then that chapell vnto And showyde hym at an hoole all that the can do. The kyng for wrothe then cowlde not stonde But hastely toke his swerde in honde And in-to the chapell then can he goo, And cursede Werebolde withe hym also. Saynt Chade w(as gone t)hen owt of that place To Lychefelde a(morwe), as goddis will was. The kyng hym t(howg)ht then for to wreke, And to his sonnes (thus) can he speke: \"Falsse tretors, he seyde, (e)xcepte you doe sone Forsake youre god, to (wh)ome ye doe retorne, I shall you here kyll bothe in this place \u2014 For youe shall haue o(\u00feer)e-wisse no grace.\" Saynt Wolfade was enspyrede gostely And answeryde his fathere reverently: \"Yt was never owre will, fathere, youe to forsake, Thowght we to Jhesu vs haue betake; For the same feythe, that we haue take vs to, Ye yowre-selffe were sworne to doe. The whiche feythe, fathere, stedfastly We will kepe, thowght we shulde dye; For no malyce nor threyt that you can make, Owre cristendome will we never forsake\". Werebolde to the kyng then seyde, I-wis: \"Alas, syr, howe mey youe suffer this? But yf youe wreeke you here anone, Youre wurshipe for ever shall be gone\". The kyng for woode was nye owt of mynde And dyde forgett all nature and kynde: And withe his swerde smote of saynt Wolfade heede, And lefte hym lyeng there all for dede. The yonger brothere then began to flee, And his fathere lepte to hym withe greate crueltye And withe his swerde he rawght hym thorowe-owt And slee hym there withe-owetyn dowte. And so for the feythe these good marters twayne Of there owne fathere thus were the slayne. And when the kyng this cruell dyde hade done, Home to hys castell he hyede hym full sone. Then Werebolde to hym can saye: \"A manfull dyde, syr, ye haue done to|daye\". A gloryous myracle then there (bef)ell, As the story of them can vs ri(ght te)ll: (F)or, when there fathere homew(ard) was gone, The body of saynt Wolfade (rose) vp anone And toke hys owne hede in h(is) armys two And lyke a queke man began to goe And browght that hede throwght goddis grace Frome Borostone here, in-to this same place Where as he nowe shrynede ys; There he offeryde vp hys owne hede, I-wis. But when the kyng to hys castell was cummynge, There befell a wonderfull thynge: Right in the kyngys owne sight Vengaunce toke Werebolde anone right: He waxed woode and wolde not blyne, For the devyll trewly was hym within: His legges and armys then can he gnave And hym-selffe there all to-drawe, And seyde: \"alas, that ever I was borne! For bodye and sowle I am no forlorne! Ms. no st. now. For venga&umacr;nce of this dyde that I haue done My sowle to hell it muste full sone\". And thus in presence of the kynge This traytore made a wrechyde endynge. But when kyng Wolfere hade seyne all this, Then wyste he well he hade done amys, And begane hys conscyence to remore, And for this dyde then sikyde full sore And in hys harte he was so woo, That for sorow he wyste not what to doe. He wente to hys wiffe withe a sory chere And tolde her off that case infere. Then was she sory that the were slayne, But of there marterdome she was full feyne, And comfortede the kyng all that she myght And concellyde hym to go to saynt Chade full right And off all hys synnes hym for to shryve And there to forsake his wikede lyve, And throwght-owt all his realme to destroe mawmentry And full to crye for grace and marcy. And she wolde then goe bury her sonnes twayne, She hyed her to the place where the were slayne. And when she to Borstone dyde cumme, There she founde the body of Ruffyn, her sone, All wrappyde in blode one the gronde there he laye; But Wolfade that she most lovyd, frome thens was awey. For sorowe of saynt Wolfade almoste she can dye And supposyde that wylde bestes hade etyn hys bodye; She myght not stonde for woo, but fell downe on the gronde And, as the story tellythe, right there anone she swonede. Owre lorde god then frome heven sent her good confortynge: A greate compenny of angellys withe melodye syngyng, The sweteste nose that a man myght here, Frome heven to erthe the came, syngyng full clere. She was so reiosyde withe that melodye and syght, That hur greate hevenes was gone anone right. The angels toke vp the body of Ruffyn, her sone, And bare it vp in the eyre, and bade her aftur cumme; The browht the bode emonge them withe ioye and blysse Right in this place, wheras it shrinede ys. There knewlede saynt Wolfade, as I vnderstonde, All lyke a queke man, withe hys hede in his honde. The angellys toke Ruffyn and sett hym besyde hys brothere, And sed that god hade chosen this place, that nother shuld part fro other(e); The bade hur in this place that she shulde them bury, The wente then to heven agayne, withe a note full mery. When seynt Ermenylde hade sene that syght, She knelyde one her knees and thankede god almyght. She wente then anone withowt tarieng And all that she hade sene she tolde the kyng. The kyng withe greate contrecyone wente to seynt Chade, For to amende hym of hys lyffe, that he evyll hade lade. When he camme to the chapell, theras seynt Chade was, There he founde hym devowtly stondyng at masse. A full fewre myrachle he sae throwe goddis grace: \u2014 Ms fewre = feire. The sone hit shone throwe an hoole in the same place; Sente Chade, or he wente to masse, he leyde hys clothes hym froo: The sone-beyme trewly helde them frome the gronde tho. The kyng then was full glade, when he hade sene \u00feat syght, And vnderstode sone that it was god almyght. He saye \u00feer the hart, that browght hys sonnes to cristenyng, Withe a rope a-bowte hys nek as a tame beste stondyng, An oxe withe the hart stondynge, and etyng there meyte infere. The kyng wiste that saynt Chade to god then was full dere. As sone as masse was done, the kyng fell downe And besowght saynt Chade of absolu|cyone; He shrove hym there to sente Chade withe good devocyone And askede marcy for hys synne withe hartely contrycyone. Seynt Chade toke hym to grace and gaue hym absolucyone And restoryde hym to the faithe, vnder this condycyone: That he shulde for hys sonnes sake, whiche he hade sleyne, Belde vp an abbey. there-to he grantede feyne. He wente anone and destroyde all maw|mentry throe hys londe And fowndyde the abbey of Peterboro, as I vnderstonde. He belde vp churches and mayntenede Christes lawe And to greate perfectyone frome thens furthe cane he drawe. Seynt Ermenylde, hys wyffe, wente then anone And buryede \u00feer her sonnes in a tombe of stone; Bothe Wolfade and Ruffyn she buryede in this place \u2014 Wheras the showde many myracles throwe goddys grace. That tyme men vsed, to onor dede mennes bonnes, Theras the were buryede forto caste stonnes. So many men for deuocyone (caste) stones theder then, im Ms. fehlt browghte od. caste. That \u00feus \u00fee name of Stone of stones furste begane. Seynt Ermenylde then for memorall of her sonnes two, The whiche dyde marters and virgyns also, She fowndyde here a monastery of vir|gyns clere And ordenede theryn nonnes and preestes infere. This begane the fowndacyone of this place sekerly Thore Ermenylde, that fowndyde here a place of nonry. And thus it was a nonry, as I vnder|stonde, Tyll that Willam Bastarde conquerede this londe, Whiche camme frome Normandy, withe many lordys infere, Whos names be writyn in a tabull on the right syde the qweer. To them he gaue greate lordshipes that to hym was sure: And so one, Enfame, was made master here. 319 ff.) Ms. Ensame od. Eusame? And when he se that \u00feis lordshipe longed to a nonry, He thowght hym-selfe it forto haue and the abbey to destroye; He went and destroyede all that he fownde there, And slewe the preestes and the nonnes all infere. God sende hym suche sekenes for that he had done, That he shulde never haue recouerance, but he repentyde sone. He wyste well he hade done amys, and was sory therefore And thowght: if he mywght leve, he wolde do so no more. That tyme the abbey of Kenelworthe was in byldyng By one Jeffray Glentone, cha(m)berleyne to the kyng. This Jeffray was nye cosyn to Ensame, lorde of Stone: Therfore Ensam to hym wente, to make hys mone. He tolde hym of that myscheffe that was hym befall, And howe he hade sleyne the preestes and the nonnes all. Geffrey Glentam concelyde hym, marcy forto crye And to restore the howse ageyne, that dyde it so destroe; In as myche as the ordere of chanons that tyme was more sade Then was the ordere of nonnes, therefore he hym rade To fownde a howse of chanons in wor|shipe of sent Wolfade. As sone as he hade grantyde thereto, hys heele he hade. He gave the howse of Stone to Kenelworthe abbey anone And made the chanons of Kenelworthe to Stone withe hym to go(ne). Thus was this abbey fowndyde furst a nonry By seynt Wolfade mother, sent Ermenylde, trewly, And after a howse of chanons by Ensam it was made And thus was edefyede in worshipe of seynt Wolfade. And when this fownder Ensam was dede and leyd on bere, After hym hys (sone) Arnolde was fownder here. im Ms. fehlt sone? This Arnolde dyde a forfet, wherefore he loste hys londe. And then it fell by right to the Baron of Stafforde honde. How the lordes of Stafforde fowndyd \u00feis place, \u00fee sothe if ye will here, Here-by in a tabull is writtyn all the processe infere. A chanond went after of this place to the corwte of Rome, He toke seynt Wolfade hede wiht hym, and to \u00fee pope he come; He tolde hym of hys myracles and of hys lyffe also And besowght hym that he wolde do canonyse hym tho. He proferede, in the popes presens in-to a fyre to goe, To prove whethere sent Wolfade wolde kepe hym frome woe. The pope wolde not suffre hym to tempte in suche manere, But grantyde hys petycyone withe-owt any were. Anone he lett canonyse this martyr, seynt Wolfade, And wrote hym in hys martelege and a saynt hym made. The chanond came howmwarde, and full glade was he, And browght withe hym seynt Wolfade hede into Vytherb citie. When he came in the toune, into a churche can he goe: Seynt Wolfade hede wolde not remove, for no thyng he cowld doe. The chanond vnderstode well that it was goddys wyll That seynt Wolfade hede shulde abyde there styll. The chanond lefte the hede there, as I vnderstonde, In sygne that god wolde haue it worshipe in a strang londe. Ms. that that. He came home to Stene agayne and browght \u00fee popes by(ll). Thus was seynt Wolfade canonysed, as was goddys wyl. Then was hys body put in shryne, and hys broder hym (by): Where many myracles god haue wrowht by them sekerl(y). haue st. has. Who-so with good (wyl) and hart meke im Ms. fehlt wyll? Will make hys petycyone and here seynt Wolfade seeke, He may be seker of hys boone, here socure to haue; ethere = hethere. And that ever ethere do cumme, seynt Wolfade dothe them saue, And hys broder Ruffyn, \u00feat withe hym is shrynede infere, As thys tabull maket mensyon that ys wryttyn here. And all that on this tabull redes, god grante them hys grace, Throe the meyne of these marters in heven to haue a place. Amen abc deus e f g h"}, "10": {"0": "10.

Mo coles gan he gete, To blowe he was full fayne. The fyre sparkeled and spronge, He cast on water sometymes amonge, And sayd: \"Yet I hope to make the yonge, Wythout any layne\". Than he hent her up on hy And layed her on the stethy And hamered her strongely With strokes that were ungayne. Fast on her he layed, \"Waxe yong, dame!\" he sayd.

Though both thy legges be awai, Yet speke, pardy, thou may. Say on, dame, I the pray, Felest thou any wo? Dame, I have lost on the Moche labour truely; Now and thou deed be, So fayre must me befall\". Loud on her he can cry And sayde: \"Dame, speke on hye, Or by my trouth, truely Brenne thee up I shall. What? canst thou nothyng say? I holde thee deed by this day\". Her arme anone he thr&emacr;w away Even agaynst the wall. And lyghtly his way he went than, After Jesu fast he ran, As he had ben a madde man, And full fast kan hym call, And sayd: \"For saynt charyte, Abyde nowe and speke wyth me! But thou me helpe, truely, My cares are full colde. My owne dame I have slayne, I wolde have made her yonge agayne \u2014 All my laboure was in vayne, Her legges wolde not holde\".

Sayd our lorde: \"Go thy way! Now thou doest me pray, I shall helpe that I maye Her for to restore\". Anone as he her se, He blessed her full fayrely And bad her stande upon hy: Anone she rose up there. She semed younge and not olde, Bryght as blossome her to beholde, Fayrer by a thosand folde Than she was before; She was whyte as a bone of whale, Bryghter then berall. Than to the earth gan she fall And thanked god intere. The smyth had good game And fetched forth hys beldame. Than they all thre in-same Kneled there in-fere And helde up theyr hands on hy(ght) And thanked god wyth all theyr mygh(t) That he had them so dyght And mended theyr chere. Our lorde sayd to the smyth tho: \"Loke, thou brenne never mo! For this craft, I shal tel the, Can thou never lere. But here a poynt I gyve the: The mayster shalt thou yet be Of all thy craft truely Wythout any delay; What man of craft soever be, And he have no helpe of the, Thoughe he be never so sle, Warke not he may\". Than our lorde forth went And bad the smyth take good tent That he no mo folke brent, By nyght nor yet by day. Our lorde thus forth gan go And left them togyther so, And dyd many a mervayle mo In dyvers countreis. He made many a croked ryght And gave blynd men agayne theyr syght, Dead men throughe hys myght He raysed full sone agayne, Leprous made he clere, Defe men for to here, And other sycknesses in fere He heled them certayne: All sycke men that to hym sought And to hym that were brought, And loved lely in theyr thought, l. leved? And were losed of theyr payne. Pray we all to hym thys That suche a lordy is: That he brynge us to blys That never shall mys. Amen. Thus endeth the game How the smyth brent hys dame And after made her agayne By our blessed lord. Finis.

The stasyons of Jerusalem. (Wallfahrt nach Jerusalem). Aus Ms. Ashm. 61, fol. 128.", "1": "Das Gedicht schildert eine jener Pilgerfahrten, welche im 14. u. 15. Jahrh. so h\u00e4ufig von F\u00fcrsten, Edlen und reichen B\u00fcrgern, in gr\u00f6sseren oder kleineren Z\u00fcgen, nach dem h. Lande unternommen wurden. Die Seereise begann von Venedig aus, zu Ostern oder S. Johanni, auf grossen Galeeren unter Leitung eines venetianischen Patrons, der die Pilger auch im h. Lande selbst begleitete und ihre Verhandlungen mit den muhamedanischen Beh\u00f6rden f\u00fchrte; sie ging die H\u00e4fen Venedigs entlang: Corfu, Modon auf Morea, Candia, Rhodus, Cypern, und endete in Joppe, dem Hafen Jerusalems. Hier landete man unter feierlichem Gesange des Te deum, k\u00fcsste den h. Boden und schm\u00fcckte sich mit den Strandmuscheln, dem Attribute des Pilgers. Von da ritt man, unter dem Geleit von Muhamedanern, auf Eseln nach Jerusalem, welches man in h\u00f6chster Andacht, mit einem Te deum betrat. Man herbergte hier in der Regel in dem ber\u00fchmten Franziskanerkloster auf Sion Andere stiegen im Johanniterhospiz, oder bei einem der venetianischen oder genuesischen Consuln ab. , dessen Guardian den Pilgern meist schon bis Rama entgegenkam. Diese M\u00f6nche waren die Wegweiser der Pilger an den h. St\u00e4tten, in seit langer Zeit hergebrachter Ordnung; sie hatten die Pil|gerfahrten wieder in Fluss gebracht, die Sagen und Legenden gesammelt und lokalisirt, auch wohl in B\u00fcchlein verzeichnet, die sie den Pilgern mitgaben \u2014 so erkl\u00e4rt sich die genaue Uebereinstimmung aller Reisebeschreibungen dieser Art. Man besuchte nun die h. St\u00e4tten, soweit der Besuch von den Herren des Landes (seit 1382 den \u00e4gyp|tischen Mameluken, seit 1517 den T\u00fcrken) gestattet wurde: die Grabeskirche (in unserm Ged. zuerst, in der Regel erst am Schlusse der Wanderung), wo man der Mitternachtsmesse beiwohnte; die h. St\u00e4tten an der via dolorosa, dann rechtsherum im Thale Josaphat und Siloe (\u00f6stlich) und auf dem Sionsberge (s\u00fcdlich). An den folg. Tagen besuchte man Bethlehem (2 deutsche Meilen von Jerusalem), und auf einem Umwege zur\u00fcckkehrend die h. St\u00e4tten im Gebirge Juda; dann den Jordan, worin man, meist in voller Kleidung, badete an der Stelle der Taufe Christi, das todte Meer, und auf dem R\u00fcckwege den Berg der 40 t\u00e4gigen Fasten (Quarentana) und Bethanien. Selten besuchte man noch den Berg Sinai mit seinem ber\u00fchmten Katharinenkloster. \u2014 Reisebeschreibungen dieser Art haben sich mehrere erhalten, meist genau \u00fcberein|stimmend in der Ordnung und Beschreibung der h. St\u00e4tten, Legenden und Reliquien; so von deutschen die des Landgrafen Wilhelm des Tapfern von Th\u00fcringen i. J. 1461, ed. von J. G. Kohl Bremen 1868, die der B\u00fcrger Hans Tucher von N\u00fcrnberg i. J. 1478 und Helfrich von Leipzig i. J. 1565, besonders des Dominikaners Felix Faber aus Ulm Evagatorium in terrae sanctae peregrinationem (aus d. J. 1480 u. 83) ed. von C. D. Hassler 1843 u. 49 (in d. Biblioth. des litter. Vereins von Stuttgart, vol. I, II, u. III), ferner das \"Reissbuch des h. Landes\" Frankfurt 1609. \u2014 Von neueren H\u00fclfsmitteln vgl. Ersch u. Gruber's Encycl. s. v. Jerusalem, Robinson \"Pal\u00e4stina\" Halle 1841, Tobler \"Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten aus Jerusalem\" S. Gallen 1853, Tobler \"Die Siloahquelle und der Oelberg\" S. Gallen 1852, Geisheim \"Die Hohenzollern am h. Grabe zu Jeru|salem\" Berlin 1858, Sepp \"Jerusalem und das h. Land\" Schaffhausen 1863, Vogu\u00e9 \"le temple de J\u00e9rusalem\" Paris 1864 u. a. Die einzige Hs. des engl. Gedichts, Ashm. 61, ist vielfach verderbt und fehler|haft; insbesondere ist ein ganzer Passus, v. 809\u2014840, mit dem Besuche Bethaniens und den Schlussworten des Dichters, vom Schreiber unrichtig hinter V. 736 (nach dem Besuche Bethlehems) versetzt \u2014 ich habe diese Stelle an dem richtigen Orte wieder eingef\u00fcgt. Auch sonst scheint der urspr\u00fcngl. Text vielfach ver\u00e4ndert; auff\u00e4llig ist jedenfalls der Wechsel von Stropfen (im Anfange u. am Ende u. v. 271\u20144) und Reim|paaren. Das Alter des Gedichts ist schwer zu bestimmen. Ein \u00e4hnliches Gedicht ist \"the stacions of Rome\" in Reimpaaren, aus Ms. Vernon fol. 314 (c. 1370) ed. v. Furnivall f\u00fcr die Early Engl. Text Soc. 1867, und aus Mss. Cott. Calig. A II u. Lamb. 306 ed. v. Furnivall in Political, religious and love poems pp. 113\u201444 f\u00fcr die E. E. T.

Firste to him-self thus he spake and sayde: \"What is she this, where dothe this goodely duelle? Who sawe ever to-forne so faire a maide, Whiche alle othir in beaute dothe excelle? Of wommanhede she is the verray welle; For me semeth myn herte in euery weyne Is thurgh-perced with hir Iyene tweyne.\" And with that thought he made for to gone His seruauntes to hir Innocence, Bad thei sholde enquere of hir an&omacr;ne What that she was, with al hir diligence, hir st. her.

Where she prayde: if it were possible, Hir mortal foo, dredful and odible, The lorde besechynge that she myght him see, Whiche cause was of hir aduersite, Hir impugnynge thurgh his mortal fight That man first brought to destruccyoun. And sodeynly appered in hir sight, Where as she lay boundene in prisoun, In the lykenesse of a felle dragoun The olde serpent, whiche called is Sathan, And hastyly to assayle hir he begane; With open mouthe, the virgyne to de|uour, First of alle he swolwed in hir hede.

And efte ageyne to assayl hir he be|gane, The story seith, and after dothe appeere By gret disceit in lykenesse of a man; And she deuoutly, with hir yen clere Lyfte vp to god, gan maken hir prayere. And as she lay in hir orisoun, Vnder hir fete lyggyng the dragoun, The deuel venquysshed toke hir by the honde, Spake thes wordes as I shal devyse: \"Thou hast me bounde with invisible bonde: Whiche victorie ought ynogh suffice; Cese of thy power, and lat me now aryse, For I may not abidene thi constreynt: In this batayle thou hast me made so feynt.\" And she aroos withouthe fere or drede, This cely ma(i)de, this tendre creature, By grace of god hent him by the hede And cast him doun, for al his felle ar|mure, Vnder hir fete \u2014 he myght not recure; And on this serpent for to do more wrake, Hir ryght fote she sette vpon his bake. \"Oo feende, quod she, of malys serpen|tyne, Remembre of the how I haue victorye, A clene mayde, by powere femynyne: Whiche shal be rad to myn encrees of glorye, Perpetuelly putte eke in memorie, How a mayde hath put vnder fote Sathan, that is of synne crope and roote\".

Whan she bigan the serpent to con|streyne To discure, and no-thinge to hyde, By what mene and what-manere treyne, Outher by malys outher by envye and pryde, That he assailed man on any syde, The kynde of man: \"telle on anoon, quod she, And be welle ware thou lye nat to me!\" \"So thely, quod he, I may it not denye,\u2014 To seyn the trouthe playnly, and not spare: My nature is of custume for to lye, As I that am of trouthe and vertue bare; Lyggynge awayte ayenste the welfare Of folkes goode, and alway envyous To alle that ben parfite and vertuous.
