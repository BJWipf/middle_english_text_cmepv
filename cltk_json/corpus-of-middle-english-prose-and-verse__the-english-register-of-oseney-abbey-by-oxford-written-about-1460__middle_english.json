Thes witnesses, Theobalde archiebisshop of Canterbury, Bisshop of Wircetur Symon, Thurstane Another mark of forgery. Thurstan died 1140. If the charter were genuine, it would have been witnessed by Henry Murdac, archbishop 1147-53. archiebisshop of Yorke, Robert Bisshop of lyncoln, Gilbert ffilioth Herforde, Henry Doyly and Gilbert his brother, and other. [NOTE.\u2014As far back as Anthony Wood's time (City of Oxford, ii. 190-2) the preceding section of the Oseney Register was felt to be a puzzle, and many of the names in it long remained untraced. The Rev. H. E. Salter, by collation of the original Oseney deeds as well as of the Registers, has solved the problem of the section and identified its names. The 'charter,' he points out, must have been invented after 1191, by tacking together several grants of earlier and later dates, without the least attempt to make them fit in with each other. The charter, by its witnesses, professes to be of date 1149, but Robert Doyly II died seven years before that. The bishop of Lincoln at the foundation of Oseney was Alexander, not Robert. The constructor of the charter may have taken the name Robert either from Alexander's predecessor, Robert Bloet (1093-1123), who during his episcopate seems to have granted a confirmation-charter to St. George's church; or from Alexander's successor, Robert de Chesnei (1147-68), who in 1149 sanctioned the grant, by Henry Doyly I, of St. George's church and its possessions to Oseney. The deed makes Oseney in 1149 possessed of Frees chapel, which in fact was the gift of Thomas of St. Walery about 1191; and of the tithes of Twycross and Warton obtained in 1187-9 by an exchange, which is fully described in the Oseney Cartulary. The list of places is confused by the jumbling together of names taken from different confirmations. Thus, the scribe gives both Perieth and Woodperry, but they are probably the same; so also, probably, Leyes and Northlye; Asshe and Tenesse; Cawdewell (Caldewell) and Goldwell.]", "3": "[22.] A confirmacion off Geffrey of Iuory \u00fee sone of Roger of Iuory off \u00fee Same yifte.

NOTE.\u2014The charter, as it stands, cannot be genuine, because the Iveri family became extinct about 1110, several years before Oseney was founded. A genuine deed, by which Jeffrey of Iveri confirmed its possessions to the church of St. George, seems to have been adapted to strengthen the forgery (no. 21), by substituting 'Marye of Oseney' for 'George.'", "4": "[23.] A confirmacion of Henry Doylly \u00fee ffirst \u00fee Sone MS. has 'the Sone the Sone.'

[NOTE.\u2014This is not the place to discuss a very interesting, but most obscure, point in Oxford topography, as to which Anthony Wood himself is more than usually hesitating (City of Oxford, ii. 112-7). Still, since it is distinctly brought up in these documents, the facts may be briefly set down. (A) Between Oxford Castle and the site of Oseney stands St. Thomas' parish church, now, and for long back, the mother church of the west suburbs of Oxford: see Map at beginning of Wood's City of Oxford , ii. (B) No. 66 describes the founding of a chapel near the gate of Oseney. Were (A) and (B) separate or the same? What were the date and occasion of their foundation and refoundation, or dates and occasions of their foundations? Oseney tradition, set out in no. 63, may at once be dismissed. Could a church have been built, on the sudden inroad of war into Oxford west suburb, between Sept. and Dec. 20, 1142? Could a church have even been begun, almost within bow-shot of a hotly-besieged castle? The most probable solution of the difficulty is to take nos. 64 and 66 together, and no. 65 as referring to a distinct building. In no. 65 we have the grant by the diocesan of a semi|domestic chapel, apparently within Oseney island, probably destroyed at the dis|solution. After Oseney, in 1152, obtained possession of St. George's in the Castle (no. 23), the abbey may reasonably be supposed to have provided a more convenient church for its large parish in the west suburb of Oxford. This would account for the Church of St. Thomas the Martyr, which seems to be implied in no. 66.]", "2": "[64.] About 1180.

Afterwards, this quit-rent was doubled (no. 70), on fresh warranty being given. A sufficient reason for this warranty is found in the claim made for possession of Medley by St. Frideswyde's priory (Wigram's Cart. S. Frid ., i. 36-8), which the town staved off (1191) by agreeing to pay 8s. yearly to the priory. In 1209 happened the 'sus|pensio clericorum,' for which the town was laid under interdict. In 1214, the town submitted and agreed to pay a sum yearly to the University through St. Frides|wyde's and Oseney; changed in 1219, to through Einsham. The assignment of the 13s. 4d. quit-rent to St. Frideswyde's by the town is no doubt part of the 1214 arrangements.
