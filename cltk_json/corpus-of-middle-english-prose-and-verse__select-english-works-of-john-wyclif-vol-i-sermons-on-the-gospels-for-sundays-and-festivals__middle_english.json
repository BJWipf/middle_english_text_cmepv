For ri&yogh;t-wisnesse generaly is fulfillinge of lawe, and so fulfillinge of Goddis lawe is verrei ri&yogh;t-wisnesse; and fulfillinge of mannis lawe is Anticristis ri&yogh;t|wisnesse.

And herfore declari\u00fe Crist \u00fere manere of wickid ire. \u00dee first maner of ire is whan a man is wra\u00fe\u00feid wi\u00feouten resoun, and sich is coupable a&yogh;ens God to be jugid to helle. For \u00feis un|kyndely venym a&yogh;en \u00fee state of innocence is roote of malice wi\u00feoute-for\u00fe, \u00feat in caas is lesse yvel; and for \u00feis cause men usen whan \u00feei drawen to \u00feer dee\u00fe to for&yogh;eve men alle wrongis, and axe men mercy of here synne. \u00dee secounde degree of \u00feis ire is whanne a man ha\u00fe conseyved wra\u00fe\u00fee and breke\u00fe out in scorneful wordis of his first conseyved ire. So\u00feely ire may falle to men for to venge Goddis cause, and so may men scorne o\u00feer, for \u00feei folily synnen in God, as Hely Hely. Elias. scornede \u00fee preestis of Baal. But bo\u00fee \u00fees ben perilous, and herfore he \u00feat scorni\u00fe \u00feus is coupable to falle in conseile , where his foli shal be hardid, til \u00feat he falle to more synne. \u00dee \u00feridde degree of \u00feis ire is whan a man speki\u00fe folily, as he \u00feat sclaundri\u00fe a man or repreve\u00fe him falsely; and \u00feat man, as Crist sei\u00fe, is coupable of \u00fee fier of helle , for his ire is turned to hate, and as Seint Joon sei\u00fe, al siche been men sleeris, \u00feat ben wor\u00fei to be dampned. And so shulden men kepen charite bo\u00fee in wille and in word, and not oonly spare strokis, as Fariseis falsely seiden. And herfore shulden irrous men axe mekely for&yogh;yvenesse, for &yogh;if \u00feei wanten charite al is yvel whatever \u00feei do. And \u00feerfore if \u00feou offre \u00fei gifte to God , \u00feat \u00fee scribis preisen myche, and \u00feou \u00feenke \u00feat \u00fei bro\u00feir , for \u00fei synne, ha\u00fe a cause a&yogh;ens \u00feee, leeve \u00fei offring at \u00fee auter, and go first to be accordid wi\u00fe him.

Improper fiefs were those held upon con|dition of various other kinds of service. The devil's lordship over man is not 'proper,' because he has no right to demand of man that he should fight his battles for him; nor is his forced service to God 'proper,' because it is attended by no benefit to himself. See Hallam's Middle Ages , I. 181. , ne\u00feeles he calengi\u00fe to have greet lordshipe, and so \n  maugre his he serve\u00fe to God, and \u00feis servise is unpropre, as is \u00fee fendis lordship, si\u00fe he serve\u00fe not God to his owne mede but a&yogh;ens his wille he profiti\u00fe to Cristis Chirche, and \u00feus for gene|ralite of lordship of Crist, he sei\u00fe, who is not wi\u00fe him is a&yogh;ens him, and \u00feus sei\u00fe Crist wel, \u00feat we may not serve God and richesse of \u00fee worlde, for \u00feei ben contraries; for as we may not serve \u00fee fend wi\u00fe servise of God, so we may not serve \u00fee world \u00feat is \u00fee fendis servant.

For &yogh;if a man traveile for goodis of \u00feis world, and ha\u00fe ri&yogh;t entent for to worshipe God, he serve\u00fe not \u00fee world, but it serve\u00fe him.

For ech man \u00feat heie\u00fe him by presumpcioun shal be mekid bi God, and he \u00feat meki\u00fe him in his soule shal be heyed bi God. \u00deere we shal undirstonde \u00feat Crist speki\u00fe not here of worldely feste, ne of place, for \u00feanne his sentence were nou&yogh;t; for \u00fean strif shulde be for place, and oonli oon shulde do Cristis bidding, and so Crist shulde ordeyne discencioun wi\u00feouten fruyt among men; and herfore shulde we undirstonde \u00feat \u00feis feste is \u00fee laste soper, \u00feat shal be in heven of seintis aftir \u00fee day of dome; and \u00fee last place at \u00feis feeste shulde be mannis reputacioun, bi whiche he shulde not presume to be in heven bifore o\u00feirs, but reste mekeli in \u00feis \u00feat he shal come to hevene.

Upon turning however to the Commentary of Nicholas de Lyra, written in the early part of the four|teenth century, I found some words which, I think, solve the difficulty. Distinguishing this Bethany (Beth|abara in the authorized version) from the one near Jerusalem, De Lyra de|scribes it as lying beyond the Jordan, 'scilicet in sorte duarum tribuum et dimidiae;' i. e. Reuben and Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Wyclif probably meant to say the same thing, but inadvertently omitted mention of the half-tribe, of which indeed very slight notice is taken in the account (Numb. xxxii.) of the negotiation between Moses and the 'lynages' (Wycl. Ver.) of Reuben and Gad. ; and so men seyen \u00feat \u00feer ben two Be\u00feanies in \u00feat lond, oon biside Jerusalem where Lazarus was reisid to lyf, and ano\u00feer bi&yogh;onde \u00fee water where Joon hadde mater to baptise men.

Evang.) says, 'Hic est Jo|annes Evangelista . . . . qui virgo a Deo electus est; quem de nuptiis, volentem nubere, vocavit Deus.' But he does not identify these 'nuptiae' with the marriage at Cana. , and Crist was his cosyn, and Cristis modir was his aunte; and herfore \u00feei weren homelyer in \u00feis weddinge of Joon.

And herfore noti\u00fe Austyn The interpretation throughout this sermon is generally founded on S. Austin's eighth Tractate In Jo|bannis Evangelium. Compare the fol|lowing passage: 'Miraculum autem quod facturus erat, secundum divini|tatem facturus erat, non secundum infirmitatem; secundum quod Deus erat, non secundum quod infirmus natus erat. . . . . . Miraculum ergo exigebat mater, at ille tanquam non agnoscit viscera humana, operaturus facta divina, tanquam dicens, Quod de me facit miraculum, non tu ge|nuisti; divinitatem meam non tu genuisti: sed quia genuisti infirmi|tatem meam, tunc te cognoscam, cum ipsa infirmitas pendebit in cruce.' how Jesus Crist clepi\u00fe specialy in \u00fees two places his moder, woman, and here he figuride his speche in his passioun.

For, as men seyen comounly, Crist moste passe \u00feis secounde Paske, and in \u00fee \u00feridde Paske die gladly for mankynde. And so Crist suffride more freely \u00fean Baptist or o\u00feer martiris. But he was more nedid bi wisdom to suffre as him silfe had cast, and so, as Crist himsilfe hadde ordeyned, Baptist shulde die bifore, and so go to purgatorye and be taken out bi Crist. And \u00feus Crist &yogh;af ensaumple to us to fle de\u00fe, whan he move\u00fe us, as al his lyf was ensaumple to teche men how \u00feei shal lyve. \u00dee secounde doute is axid here, whi Crist wolde not take \u00fee rewme of Judee \u00feat was owid to him, si\u00fe \u00fee puple preferide him anoon, aftir \u00feis myracle \u00feat Crist had fedd \u00feus \u00fee folk.

For this is clearly the meaning of Wyclif's words, and this was in fact the main point of his controversy with the friars on the Eucharistic mystery; in which he quarrelled with their definition of the consecrated species as an 'accident without a subject' for this very reason, that it utterly denied the co-presence of bread in any sense, after consecration. It is therefore a point of much interest to ascertain whether St. Austin's works really contain any passage which would justify the reference in the text; in other words, which would support Wyclif's favourite theory of consubstantiation; and I shall be glad if this note should be the means of directing the attention of theological students to the search.

Unde per ideas intelliguntur formae alia|rum rerum praeter ipsas res exis|tentes.

And so it is kyndely breed, as Poul sei\u00fe I do not know to what passage the writer refers. , but it is sacramentally verre Goddis bodi. And herfore sei\u00fe Austyn I am indebted to the kind as|sistance of Professor Stubbs for the discovery of the passage in the works of St. Augustine to which the text probably refers, though some force appears necessary to make the words of the saint bear the meaning which Wyclif imposes on them. The pas|sage is in a remarkable sermon, No. 272 (vol. v., p. 1104 of the Bene|dictine edition), addressed 'ad In|fantes' on their due reception of the Eucharist. The impression left by the entire sermon might certainly, to a mind already prepossessed. accord with the view of the Eucharist taken by Wyclif; on the other hand, the language is quite compatible with the view taken by his opponents, the friars. The words most to the pur|pose are these: 'Ista, fratres, ideo dicuntur sacramenta, quia in eis aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur. Quod videtur, speciem habet corporalem; quod intelligitur, fructum habet spi|ritalem.' , \u00feat \u00feing is breed \u00feat \u00fei i&yogh;en tellen \u00feee and \u00feat \u00feou seest wi\u00fe hem. For it was not trowid bifore \u00fee fend was losid It had become a popular belief by this time, among the spiritual Franciscans and the various revo lutionary sects, that since the year 1000 A.D the devil, after his mil|lennary captivity (Apoc. xx. 2), had been let loose from the bottomless pit 'to deceive the nations.' , \u00feat \u00feis wor\u00fei sacrament was accident wi\u00feouten suget. And &yogh;it dwellen trewe men in \u00fee old bileve, and laten freris foulen hem silfe in \u00feer newe heresie. For we trowen \u00feat \u00feere is beter \u00feing \u00fean Goddis bodi, si\u00fe \u00fee holy trinite is in eche place. But oure bileve is sette upon \u00feis point; what is \u00feis sacrid hoost, and not what \u00feing is \u00feere. \u00dee secound vertue \u00feat shulde clo\u00fee trewe men is \u00fee vertue of hope, \u00feat is ful nedeful; how men shulde hope bi \u00feer lyfe here, and first, wi\u00fe \u00fee grace of God, for to come to hevene. And to \u00feis entent men taken now \u00feis sacrament, so \u00feat bi takynge herof \u00feer mynde be freschid in hem to \u00feenken \n  on kyndenes of Crist to maken hem clene in soule.

And \u00feus, as Austyn declari\u00fe I have to thank Professor Stubbs for this reference also. In Serm. 272, already quoted, and also in Serm. 227, the various processes that enter into the making of bread are com|pared to the spiritual operations which combine to make the perfect Christian. But in Serm. 229, these processes are distinctly set down as four: threshing, which answers to conversion by preaching; grinding, which represents the discipline of fasting and exorcism; mixing with water, which is Baptism; and baking, which corresponds to the flames kin|dled in souls by the Holy Ghost. , foure poyntis \u00feat falli\u00fe fallen , B, C, E. to makinge of breed techen us \u00feis charite, and algatis to have it now.

And si\u00fe God may not folde fro ri&yogh;t and resoun, it is knowen bi Goddis lawe \u00feat no pope assoili\u00fe but in as myche as Crist assoili\u00fe first This position recalls one of the twenty four conclusions, condemned by the 'earth-quake' synod of 1382: 'That no prelate ought to excom|municate any one, unless he first know that he is excommunicated by God.' Lewis's Wyclif , p. 108. . And her|fore Seint Petre and o\u00feer Cristis apostlis asoilliden not \u00feus, ne &yogh;yve siche indulgencis; for \u00feei diden never siche dedis but whan God enspiride hem. And so no \u00feing is falser \u00fean ypocritis to boste \u00feus, and &yogh;if men loke to resoun \u00feei may wele se \u00feat many siche feynyngis ben of \u00fee fendis scole. For ellis my&yogh;te a pope assoile men bo\u00fee of peyne and blame The ordinary indulgence ab|solved poena sed non culpa. In theory, the guilt of sins, and the eternal punishment due to them, were remitted in the sacrament of penance; it was the temporal pun|ishment only, the poena , which the indulgence professed to remit, in whole or in part. But it is well known that, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a great laxity prevailed, if not in the actual word|ing of indulgences, at any rate in the language of those to whom their distribution was entrusted. The form was probably observed strictly enough all along; so that the preacher's words must be taken with some allowance. In turning over the pages of the Bullarium, I observe, under the year 1515, only two years before the first public appearance of Luther, the formal grant by Leo X of two indulgences, and in both cases the form of words is; \u2014 [Indulgemus] 'quod quilibet Christi fidelis . . . . . . plenariam omnium peccatorum suorum, de qui|bus corde contritus, atque ore confessus fuerit , indulgentiam et remissionem consequatur.' , for \u00feei killen \u00feer evene cristene The allusion is to Bishop Spen|cer's crusade. When it was over, and men should cease to kill their fellow-Christians, then the papal in|dulgence, or 'assoilinge,' would also cease. , and ever while \u00feei done so; and &yogh;if \u00feei ceessen fro sich killing, \u00feer assoilinge shal ceesse. But what men wolden triste to siche assoilinge? Wel we witen \n  \u00feat God is moost lord of al o\u00feer, and no man may do synne, but &yogh;if he synne a&yogh;ens him, and no synne may be for&yogh;ovun but &yogh;if God first for&yogh;yve it. And so it is propre to God to for&yogh;yve \u00feus offence, and &yogh;if a man for&yogh;yve siche synne, \u00feat is bi power of viker; and siche power ha\u00fe he not, but &yogh;if God shewe it him. For ellis my&yogh;te he graunte pardoun for longe after \u00fee day of dome to men \u00feat God wole have dampnyd, for a newe founde praier, and heien it for mannis love more \u00fean \u00fee Pater Noster: as men seien \u00feat a pope ha\u00fe grauntid two \u00feousand &yogh;eer to ech man \u00feat is contrite and confessid of his synne, \u00feat sei\u00fe \u00feis orisoun 'Domine Jesu Christe' bitwene \u00fee sacringe of \u00fee masse and \u00fee \u00feridde Agnus Dei.

Again,\u2014'It rose above 9s. in 1294 and 1370:' 'above 8s. in 1293, 1314, 1350, 1363, 1367, 1374, 1390.' In the years 1381-1386, with|in which these sermons must have been composed if Wyclif was their author, the price of wheat was re|markably low. These statistics refer to the southern and midland coun|ties, and are thoroughly reliable. Either then, if Wyclif wrote the ser|mon, the reference must have been to a time of scarcity as far back as 1374; or, if we suppose the scarcity of 1390 to be pointed at, Wyclif was not the author of the sermon. . \u00dees ben bigynnynge of sorewis; and \u00feerfore loke wel &yogh;ou silf, for \u00feei shall bitraie &yogh;ou in her coun|ceilis, and in her sinagogis shal &yogh;e be betyn; and bifore kyngis and justices shal &yogh;e stonde, for me, in witnes to hem.

The friars,\u2014after the synod of 1382, which had been promoted, and indeed ordered, by 'the Court,' or, as we should say now, by the Government,\u2014and after the sending down of letters patent into all the counties (see Lewis, p. 106), ap|pointing inquisitors, who would be in many or most instances friars, to search out heretical writings and their fautors,\u2014might well say that the Court taught their doctrine con|cerning the Eucharist, and condemned that of Wyclif. This is called by the writer, accusing the Court of teaching the said doctrine; because, as he goes on to say, Christ and many of the saints unmistakably taught his doctrine.

Ceterum in|tra Ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi ut, quod non prae|valet sacerdos efficere per doctrinae sermonem, potestas hoc imperet per disciplinae terrorem. Saepe per reg|num terrenum celeste regnum pro|ficit, ut qui intra Ecclesiam positi contra fidem et disciplinam Ecclesiae agunt, rigore principum conteran|tur; ipsamque disciplinam quam Ec|clesiae humilitas exercere non prae|valet, cervicibus superborum potestas principalis imponat; et ut venera|tionem mereatur, virtute potestatis impertiat. \u2014 Cognoscant principes saeculi Deo debere se rationem red|dere propter Ecclesiam, quam a Christo tuendam suscipiunt.

And \u00feus sei\u00fe Poul Compare Hebrews vii. 10, Gal. iii. 17. The writer of the sermon appears to have misunderstood the first of these passages. , \u00feat Crist was in Abrahams lendis. And so Crist techi\u00fe here chastite, as Gregory sei\u00fe S. Greg. Homilia xiii. 'Lumbos enim praecingimus, cum carnis lux|uriam per continentiam coarctamus.' ;\u2014but not oonli chastite but alle fleishli vertues. \u00dees lendis ben girded bifore, whanne man, by discrescioun, drawi\u00fe from his fleish \u00fee norishment \u00feerof; or chastise\u00fe it, on o\u00feer manere, bifore it falle in synne.

For it is not ynow&yogh; to kepe us fro synnes, but if we worken gode workes bi \u00fees two lanternes.", "4": "But for \u00fees bridalis, we shal wite \u00feat \u00feei ben taken on many maneres; first for \u00fee weddingis \u00feat Crist is joyned wi\u00fe \u00fee soule; after for \u00fee dwellinge \u00feat Crist dwelli\u00fe wi\u00fe \u00fee soule; \n  and \u00fee \u00feridde for \u00fee goostli fode \u00feat soulis ben fed wi\u00fe Crist in blisse.

And so Crist is seid to turne a&yogh;en fro bridalis on two maneris. First, whanne a man is deed \u00feat Crist ha\u00fe ordeyned to come to blisse, Crist turne\u00fe a&yogh;en to his soule from dwelling wi\u00fe \u00fee Chirche in hevene. But Crist leve\u00fe not \u00feis Chirche, but on new manere dwelli\u00fe wi\u00fe \u00feis soule. But \u00feanne he must have dwelt bifore, or ellis \u00feis soule cam not bi \u00feis state. And so we shulden be liche to men \u00feat abiden \u00fee comynge of Crist, in tyme of de\u00fe, or \u00fee dai of dome. And \u00feis abiding shulde alle men marke, for \u00feis comyng is uncertein, and \u00feis tyme is perilous; si\u00fe \u00feis drau&yogh;t mot be wel drawen &yogh;if oure liif shal ou&yogh;te profite. And so to \u00fees comyngis of Crist shulde ech man make him redi; si\u00fe Crist shal come and knocke at doris, and entre to hem \u00feat ben wakinge, and redi to resseyve Crist wi\u00feouten sleping in synne. And \u00feis openyng shal be doon anoon, as li&yogh;tnyng of sonne sunne , E. is in \u00fee eir. And so Crist knocki\u00fe at oure doris whanne he techi\u00fe us signes of de\u00fe, or signe of \u00fee dai of dome; but \u00fee laste knockyng is sudeyne. &YOGH;if a man be redi bifore to dwellen wi\u00fe Crist wi\u00fe|outen ende, \u00feanne he opene\u00fe to Crist, si\u00fe \u00feis openyng is redy|nesse. And \u00feus sei\u00fe Crist ful so\u00feli, \u00feat \u00fees servauntis ben blessid whiche, whanne \u00fee Lord come\u00fe, he finde\u00fe \u00feus wakinge. So\u00feeli, Y seie to &yogh;ou, \u00feat \u00feis Lord shal girde him, and make hem sitte to mete, and passe and mynystre to hem. \u00dee sitting to mete of seintis, is confermyng of hem in blisse; \u00fee passing of \u00feis Lord bi hem is his shewing to oon and o\u00feer. And al &yogh;if \u00feis shewing be togidere, &yogh;it her taking is divers; and her diversite is signefied bi \u00feis passing of Crist. \u00deis service is li&yogh;t to Crist, for it is but Cristis shewing of his Godhede, and his manhede, in which seintis shal be fed.", "5": "And &yogh;if \u00feis Lord come in \u00fee secounde vigile, and eke in \u00fee \u00feridde, and fynde sich redynesse in \u00fees servantis, ful blessid ben \u00fees servantis , si\u00fe \u00feei anoon ben blessid of God. \u00dees \u00fere vigiles \u00feat Crist telli\u00fe \n  of here, ben \u00fere wakingis fro synne, and algatis fro \u00fee laste synne \u00feat is \u00fee worste yvel \u00feat mai be; and so we preien in \u00fee Pater noster God to delyvere us fro \u00feis yvel. \u00dees vigiles ben clepid \u00fere, for \u00fee Holy Trinite, for \u00feou&yogh;t of resoun of him, shulde make men to wake wel. And so ech tyme \u00feat man lyve\u00fe here is departid in \u00feree parties, and tyme to \u00fee dai of dome is also de|partid in \u00feree; and, for \u00fee quantite of \u00fees \u00feree is uncertein to man, \u00feerfore he shulde ever wake, and \u00feanne he waki\u00fe \u00fees \u00feree vigilis. \u00dee first \u00feree ha\u00fe ech seint, bifore \u00fee soule go fro \u00fee bodi; \u00fee to\u00feer \u00fere ha\u00fe \u00fee Chirche, bifore \u00fee dai of dome come. And so unknowing of \u00fees tymes, and knowinge how men shulden ever wake, profiti\u00fe unto Goddis children, as done alle \u00feingis. As Poul sei\u00fe The passage referred to is not in any of the Pauline epistles, but in 1 Pet. i. 17. , bi \u00feat \u00feat we knowun not \u00fee quantite of \u00fees \u00fere tymes, shulden we ever more be in drede and ever wake out of synne.", "6": "And \u00feis lore techi\u00fe Crist in a parable to his children. \u00deis \u00feing he sei\u00fe, wite we &yogh;e , E. wel \u00feat &yogh;if \u00fee housebonde wiste what tyme \u00fee So E; om.

And sich \u00feou&yogh;t of \u00fee Fadir of Hevene shulde overcome \u00fee fend in hour of de\u00fe. A&yogh;ens \u00fee secounde synne of \u00fee fend we shulden \u00feenke on God \u00fee Sone, how kyndeli he is spouse to us, and bou&yogh;te us wi\u00fe his precious blood, and how he mai not parte fro us, but &yogh;if oure unkynde|nesse be in cause; how fair and good a spouse is Crist, and how foul is \u00fee fend; and bi sich \u00feou&yogh;tis Crist wolde &yogh;eve vertue to men to overcome \u00fee fend, whanne he tempti\u00fe man in hour of de\u00fe to \u00feenke on lecherie.

On the mysterious virtues and signifi|cance supposed by the ancients to reside in the number five, the reader may, if he cares to do so, consult the treatise in Plutarch's Moralia , , and Sir Thomas Browne's Garden of Cyrus. The relation of five to the circle, and also to the sphere, is arrived at in two or three ways. Plutarch as|cribes to Plato the opinion that if there are more worlds than the one which we inhabit, there must be five , neither more nor less; and that, even if there be only one, that one may be considered as compounded out of five subordinate worlds,\u2014the four elements, and the sky, or fifth essence, 'to which alone,' he says, 'amongst all bodies, the property of revolving in a circle naturally appertains.' The apparent revolution of the celestial sphere round the earth is evidently intended. Again, Sir Thomas Browne, in noticing the singular frequency of the quinary arrangement in nature, observes (it is a thing indeed which many have observed independently) upon the very large number of flowers which have five petals, as if that was the simplest and most fundamental division of a circle into sectors. 'Five-leaved flowers are commonly disposed circularly about the stylus, according to the higher geometry of nature, dividing a circle by five radii, which concur not to make diameters, as in quadrilateral and sexangular intersections.' ( Garden of Cyrus , p. 526, ed. Bohn.) The next para|graph begins,\u2014'Now the number of five is remarkable in every circle,' but as I cannot understand the rea|soning which follows, I forbear to quote it In a curious statement quoted by the editor of Browne from Mr. Colebrooke, it is clearly shown that the simplest distribution of groups of objects round a central and interior group is a quinary ar|rangement, while at the same time, when the groups come to be mul|tiplied indefinitely, it is necessarily spheroidal. The reader will remem|ber also the quinary grouping of animals by Mr. Macleay, once so famous, and the remarkable vindi|cation of the theory in the Vestiges of the Natural History of the Creation. ; and \u00fee to\u00feer fyve foolis shal be dampned in helle wi\u00feouten eende.

And so done \u00fees cardinalis and \u00fees bishopis also. Curatis taken benefices for \u00fee same cause, but lesse; and preestis taken her ordris for devocioun of ten mark for devocioun of ten mark. ] This sounds like a phrase in common use at the time, as if one were to say now that a curate took orders for his \u00a3100 a year. The passage is of some importance, as showing that, in spite of the efforts both of the court and the bishops to keep down the salaries of priests, the average rate of pay to a working priest, (the passage has nothing to do with the parsons of livings,) in the reign of Richard II, was ten marks, or \u00a36 13 s. 4 d. per annum. It may be as well to take this opportunity of putting together a few particulars respecting the salaries of non-bene|ficed clerks in England between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. A constitution of Stephen Lang|ton, dated in 1222, thus regulates the pay of vicars perpetual:\u2014 'Statuimus, ut vicario perpetuo ad minus reditus quinque Marcarum as|signentur, qui scilicet pro quinque Marcis solet dari ad Firmam; nisi forte in illis partibus Walliae sit....' where the parish is too poor to afford so high a stipend. Five marks then were esteemed a competent salary in the early part of the reign of Henry III. Nearly a century and a half later the standard had varied but very little. In a con|stitution of 1362 Archbishop Islep ordains that a priest simply cele|brating 'annals,' or masses by the year, for the repose of departed souls, shall be satisfied with five marks a year, but that if he have also cure of souls, he shall receive six marks. Following up this con|stitution, the act of 36 Edw. III (1363) prohibits under penalties any layman from paying more than five marks a year to a priest residing in his house, and having no cure of souls. The next fifty years witness a rapid change in the value of money. Archbishop Sudbury orders that the stipends which Islep had fixed at five and six marks, shall for the same duties, 'on account of the changed times,' be raised to seven and eight marks respectively. But these were doubtless the minimum rates, and in practice more was usually given. There is even distinct evidence that ten marks was a customary rate of salary for a priest to ask. The act of 2 Henry V (1414), after reciting the act of Edw. III previously men|tioned and setting forth that the priests 'which now be' will not serve but for twelve marks, or ten marks by year at the least , to the great damage of the king's liege people, enacts that seven and eight marks shall be the legal salaries, unless by special license of the or|dinary; nine marks not to be ex|ceeded even in that case. But the changing times soon ren|dered this statute ineffectual, if it was not ineffectual from the outset. A constitution of Archbishop Chi|chely, dated in 1415, ordains that all through the province of Canter|bury the stipends of needy vicars shall be augmented as a general rule to at least twelve marks a year, if the parish revenues equal that amount. The above particulars are found in Gibson's Codex Furis Ecclesiastici Anglicani , pp. 748, 755, 938-9. In the province of York the rates appear to have been lower. From the Testamenta Eboracensia , published by the Surtees Society (vol. ii, p. 118) it appears that at York, in the middle of the fifteenth century, the customary payment in respect of a single mass was fourpence Thus in a will dated in 1446 we find\u2014'Lego ad quinde|cim missas pro anim\u00e2 me\u00e2 in ecclesia Sti Nicholai apud Novum Castrum super Tinam Vs.' And the ordinary annual payment at the same period, to a priest celebrating masses for the repose of souls, was in York|shire seven marks.

Ofte tyme, in \u00fee olde law, apperiden aungels to men, but not in sich a multitude, ne in siche a joieful speche.", "8": "And whanne \u00fee aungels wenten fro hem, \u00fees herdis spaken to hem silf, Passe we into Bedleem, and se we \u00feis word \u00feat is maad, \u00feat \u00fee Lord ha\u00fe maad, and shewid to us. And \u00feei came hastinge, and fond \u00fees \u00feree persones, Marie and Joseph, and \u00fee &yogh;ong child putt in \u00fee cratche. And whanne \u00fees heerdis sawen \u00feis \u00feing, \u00feei knewen of \u00fee word \u00feat was seid to hem of \u00feis child bi \u00fee aungel. And alle \u00fee men of \u00fee contre \u00feat herden \u00feis , wondriden, and Literally rendered from the Vul|gate,\u2014'omnes qui audierant mirati sunt, et de iis quae dicta erant a pastoribus.' of \u00fees \u00feingis, \u00feat weren seid of \u00fee heerdemen to hem. But Marie kepte alle \u00fees wordis, and bare hem to|gidere in her herte. And no drede she hadde greet confort, and undirstonding over o\u00feere men. And \u00fees heerdis turneden a&yogh;en, glorifiynge and heryinge God in alle \u00feingis \u00feat \u00feei herden and sawen, as it was seid to hem.", "9": "We supposen \u00feat aungels ledden hem to \u00feis place in Beed|leem, and confortiden hem many gatis, bo\u00fee in bodi and in soule. And \u00feei wisten bi \u00fees aungelis, and bi \u00fee good will \u00feat \u00feei hadden, how \u00feei shulden have pees in er\u00fee; and her|fore \u00feei herieden God. And so, &yogh;if we taken hede, Crist hadde company of \u00fere. First, of his fadir and of his modir, \u00feat weren bo\u00fee holi folk; after, of herdemen \u00feat lyveden symple and holi lyf. And \u00fees weren licli mo \u00fean two, and ny&yogh; \u00fee state of innocence; for God lovede Abel betere \u00fean Cayn \u00feat was his bro\u00feer. And \u00fee first was an heerde, and \u00fee to\u00feer a tiliyng man; and tiliyng men have more of craft \u00fean have heerdis in \u00feer dedis. And as God lovede Jacobes sones, \u00feat weren alle heerdemen, so he lovede \u00fees heerdis \u00feat camen for to visite Crist. And so \u00feis nativite of Crist was more \u00fean ony o\u00feer, &yogh;he, and more \u00fean Adames makyng, whanne he cam into \u00feis world; for oure Ladi and Joseph passiden Adam and Eve, and \u00fee company of aungelis passiden frendis \u00feat weren wi\u00fe oure firste eldris; and \u00fees heerdis \u00feat camen to hem pas|siden Adams children. And algatis \u00fee bir\u00fe of Crist passide So E; passiden , A. o\u00feer dedis \u00feat ever God dide; for it is more to make God man, \u00fean to make \u00feis world of nou&yogh;t. It is maistrie to make a virgyn bere a child, and dwelle a virgyn, more \u00fean to make Adam of er\u00fee, or to make Eve of Adams ribbe; but it is wi\u00feouten mesure more to make God to be a man. For here mennis wittis moten faile. But oon ensample ha\u00fe kynde &yogh;ovun us: as \u00fee spirit \u00feat is mannis soule is \u00fee same persone wi\u00fe him, so \u00fee secounde persone of God is \u00fee same persone wi\u00fe \u00feis man. But diversite is greet here and \u00feere, whoso wole loke. Leeve we \u00feis and speke we of vertues. For \u00feis child \n  is Goddis virtue, and wisdom of \u00fee Fadir of hevene. But \u00feis is bi his Godhede; and mo redelis ridelis , E. \u00fean we can telle ben so\u00fe of Crist bi his two kindis. And &yogh;if we taken good hede of him, Crist is \u00feree kyndis, and o persone; for Crist is Godhede, and bodi, and soule, and ech oon of \u00fees \u00feree. And so, as sum men seien, Crist is sevene \u00feingis, and ech of hem: for his spirit is \u00feree \u00feingis, and his bodi o\u00feer \u00feree \u00feingis, and Crist is, over \u00feis, his Godhede, but oonli oo persone of it. And so, as sevene is ful nombre of universite of \u00feingis The number seven , formed from the union of the triad, the 'perfect' number, with the tetractys, which Pythagoras venerated so profoundly, itself prime and masculine, marking the number of the planets, &c., &c., has been held sacred from the ear|liest times. See the article on 'Arithmetic' in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. , so Crist is ful rewme of hevene, and of \u00feis world; for al \u00feis world bi him is betirid, and as who made a newe world. For ech creature of \u00feis world is beterid bi his bir\u00fe. For man is beterid si\u00fe he is bou&yogh;t and maad Goddis sone and his eire, and \u00feerwi\u00fe \u00fee bro\u00feer of Crist, which is bo\u00fee God and man; angelis in hevene be beterid, si\u00fe \u00feei have more felouship, and sich felouship of seintis maki\u00fe hem more glad togidere. And \u00feus alle \u00fee fendis in helle ben beterid a&yogh;ens \u00feer wille; for \u00feer cum|pany is maad lesse, and \u00feei have harm of many felowis.", "10": "Al \u00feis world bodili shulde serve to God and to man; and it wantide \u00feis eende til \u00feat Crist was maad man; for bifore, \u00feis world fau&yogh;te wi\u00fe God and tormentide man, but fro \u00feat \u00feis pees was maad, God made \u00feis world to serve man. And herfore aungelis in hevene, for Cristis incarnacioun, wolden not take kneling of Joon, but seiden, \u00feat \u00feei weren his servantis, and servantis of his bre\u00feeren; and \u00feis \u00feei fulfillid in dede. And so ech part of \u00feis world shulde joie for \u00feis nativite; but \u00fee fendis maken sorewe, for old envie \u00feat \u00feei have. And for \u00feei shulden make ioie, \u00feei synnen in \u00feis, and harmen hemsilf. And herfore Crist is clepid a pesible kyng in \u00fee Chirche; for he made pees in al \u00feis world, and lefte fi&yogh;tinge for more pees. For man fi&yogh;ti\u00fe wi\u00fe \u00fere enemys, to have more blessid pees in hevene. And so, as many men seien, alle \u00feingis comen for \u00fee beste; for alle comen for Goddis ordenance, and so \u00feei \n  comen for God himsilf; and so alle \u00feingis \u00feat comen fallen for \u00fee beste \u00feing \u00feat mai be. Moreover to ano\u00feer witt men seien, \u00feat \u00feis world is beterid bi every\u00feing \u00feat falli\u00fe \u00feerinne, where \u00feat it be good or yvel; so moche, \u00feat \u00feis world is betere for synne \u00feat is punishid in helle; for it falli\u00fe to oure Lord to have a prisoun and prisoneris, and do his merci to hem, and savore more his seintis in hevene. And herfore sei\u00fe Gregori A passage, not worded precisely as here stated, but with the same general meaning, may be found in Gregory's Commentary In Primum Regum , lib. iv. cap. I. But there is a passage in the Sarum missal, in the office for Holy Saturday, con|taining precisely the same thought; 'O certe necessarium Adae pecca|tum et nostrum, quod Christi morte deletum est! O felix culpa, quae talem ac tantum meruit habere redemptorem!' , \u00feat it was a blesful synne \u00feat Adam synnede and his kynde, for bi \u00feis \u00fee world is beterid; but \u00fee ground of \u00feis goodnesse stondi\u00fe in grace of Jesus Crist.", "11": "But &yogh;it men mai muse how Crist is pesible kyng, si\u00fe he sei\u00fe, he cam not to sende pees in \u00fee er\u00fee but swerd, and \u00feat bitokene\u00fe fi&yogh;ting and noo pees.

And \u00feis pees stondi\u00fe in pacience, and mekenes, and o\u00feer vertues; and \u00feus was Crist pesible kyng, and he and hise hadden pees here. Fals pees is groundid in reste wi\u00fe oure enemys, whanne we assente to hem wi\u00feouten a&yogh;enstonding. And swerd a&yogh;ens sich pees cam Crist to sende into er\u00fee; for \u00feus fou&yogh;te Poul a&yogh;ens his fleish, a&yogh;ens \u00fee world and \u00fee fend; and \u00feus dide Crist, partinge fleishli frendis fro \u00fee love of o\u00feer, for \u00fee more love \u00feat \u00feei shulden have to Crist \u00feat is her God. \u00deis fals pees is cowardise, and enemyte of God; and auctor of \u00feis pees is \u00fee fend of helle.

And so bileve techi\u00fe us \u00feat he is an hooli martir. Crist seide \u00fees wordis to two maner of folk, \u00feat weren \u00fee fendis capteyns in killing of martiris; and \u00fees weren princis of preestis, and comunte of Jewis. Crist supposi\u00fe in \u00feis speche, \u00feat he is bo\u00fee God and man; and so al tyme \u00feat was, or shal be, is present to him.

Aftir, Crist declari\u00fe \u00feat \u00feis malice was oonli in hem; for God was of good wille to do good to his kyn; but sum of hem wolde not take \u00feis goodness of God. And \u00feus sei\u00fe Crist:\u2014 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how ofte wolde Y gadere \u00fei children, as an henne gaderi\u00fe her chekenes undir hir wynges, and \u00feou woldest not , but toke in veyn Goddis grace.", "5": "And here men douten comunli how Goddis wille was reversid, si\u00fe \u00fee Psalme sei\u00fe:\u2014\u00feat al \u00feat God wolde, he dide generali in hevene and in er\u00fee.

And God ha\u00fe ordeyned ever more siche wille to be fulfillid \u00feus. And so, as men speken in Latyn as men speken in Latyn. The reference in the text is probably to the great work of Archbishop Brad|wardine, the 'profound Doctor,' en|titled De Causa Dei contra Pelagium , in which the whole subject of free will and predestination was ex|haustively handled, and the popu|larity of which was very great. It appeared about the year 1340, and, as Sir Henry Savile says (pref. to edition of Bradwardine's De Causa Dei , 1618) was immediately on its publication 'tanto omnium docto|rum exceptus applausu, ut per omnes fere bibliothecas totius Europae de|scriberetur.' To this work Chaucer refers in the well-known passage in the Nun's Priest's tale, and repro|duces some of its subtle argumen|tation in the fourth book of Troylus and Cryseyde. , &yogh;if God biddi\u00fe \u00feee do \u00feis dede, God wole \u00feat \u00feou do \u00feis dede, al if \u00feou doist it not; for \u00feou art in dette to do \u00feis dede, and in \u00feat is Goddis wille endid. But God wole not \u00feat \u00feou doist \u00feis dede, for God knowi\u00fe not \u00feis treu\u00fee, but God wole \u00feat \u00feou do \u00feis dede as God wole \u00feat \u00feou shuldist do \u00feis God does not will thee to do a particular act in obedience to his command, because he is ignorant of the truth (that thou wilt not do it); but God wills thee to do the act, in so far as he desires that thou shouldst obey his precepts, though thou in fact doest it not. . And so Crist doubli\u00fe \u00feis citees name to telle defaute of \u00feer unkyndenesse; how \u00feei sleen Goddis prophetis, and stoone Goddis servauntis sent to hem , as was Stephen and many o\u00feer, \u00fee which al \u00feis citee killide.", "6": "And after Crist telli\u00fe \u00fee veniaunce \u00feat shal be taken for \u00feis synne.

'Cum igitur esset Jo|hannes XCIX annorum, a passione Domini secundum Ysidorum anno LXVIII, apparuit ei Dominus cum discipulis suis dicens, Veni, dilecte mi, ad me, quod tempus est ut in mensa mea cum tuis fratribus epuleris. Surgens autem Johannes coepit ire. Cui Dominus, Dominica die ad me venies.' The legend goes on to describe how St. John caused his grave to be dug near the altar in his church at Ephesus, and laid him|self down in it; from which point the story evaporates, as it were, in a cloud of miracles, and makes no mention of his actual death. This, however, our author might have found in St. Augustine, who, in Tract CXXIV In Johann. Evang. , says that it was related in an apo|cryphal writing that the apostle, after his grave had been dug, 'ibi se tanquam in lectulo collocasse statimque eum esse defunctum. ' .

This sin|gular legend is not found, so far as I can discover, in any writer of earlier date than Petrus Comestor, (the Mangiadore of Dante, Paradiso , xii. 134), author of the Historia Scholastica , from whom De Lyra quotes it. Peter was a priest of Troyes in the twelfth century; the Historia is said to have been pro|duced in the year 1181. In the dedication, addressed to the arch|bishop of Sens, Peter declares that he had written the work at the urgent entreaty of many friends, in order to 'elucidate the too brief and obscure narrative of holy scripture.' Labbe, in his Scriptores Ecclesiastici , thus writes of him;\u2014'Historiam Ecclesiasticam consarcinavit eamque glossis tum falsissimis tum insulsis|simis refercivit, quae tamen ita tum ubique obtinuit, ut ipsi scripturae sacrae nudae ac purae pene pre|ferretur.' The story of the veracious Petrus is, that while Herod was on his way to Rome, whither he had been sum|moned by Augustus with reference to the quarrels between him and his sons, he stayed for a time at Tarsus in Cilicia, and burnt all the ships of the people of Tarsus, in revenge for their having provided the wise men with a ship to return home in. Whereby the prophecy in the forty|eighth Psalm was fulfilled, 'Thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind,' Tarshish being of course identical with Tarsus! , and dwelte \u00feere aboute two &yogh;eer bifore he cam a&yogh;en.

And \u00feanne was fulfillid \u00feat was seid bi Jeremye: A vois was herd in hi&yogh; , which vois was a wepinge and a greet weiling,\u2014Rachel was weping for hir children and she wolde not be confortid, for \u00feei weren not , quic \u00feus.", "4": "\u00deis prophecie is undirstonden on many maneres of men.

In it is said, (I quote from Gieseler) that the brother Pacificus had seen in a vision many seats in heaven, 'inter quas vidit unam em|inentiorem aliis et prae omnibus gloriosius fulgentem, et ornatam omni lapide pretioso;' of which seat it was told him,\u2014'haec sedes fuit Luciferi, et loco ejus sedebit humilis Franciscus.'

In the treatise De Spirituali Creatione among the Quaest. Dispu|tatae , Aquinas writes (art. 4) 'Quidam vero dixerunt quod a principio inest anima vegetabilis, et illa eadem cum fuerit magis perfecta fit anima sen|sitiva, et tandem fit anima intellec|tiva.' But the Christian philosopher, holding out for the oneness and in|corruptibility of the human soul, will not admit this; he looks upon the embryonic changes as indicating successive stages of the one soul, but no more. 'Sic cum in embrione primo sit anima vegetativa tantum, cum perventum fuerit ad majorem perfectionem tollitur forma imper|fecta, et succedit forma perfectior, quae est anima vegetativa et sensi|tiva simul, et ultimo cedente, suc|cedit ultima forma completissima, quae est anima rationalis.' To these three elementary stages St. Augus|tine, in the De Quantitate Animae , adds four more, that of moral effort, in which the soul is seeking virtue, that of moral perfection and rest, that of spiritual effort or tendency towards God, and that of the soul's union with and rest in God. ; but as we bileven \u00fee wordis of \u00fee gospel, \u00feat Baptist was glad in comyng of Crist, so we supposen \u00feat he was on lyve a litil bifore \u00feat Jesus was conseyved, but we musen not how muche, si\u00fe it is Goddis privyte.", "5": "Of \u00feis gospel mai we take, how it is grete synne to mys|trowe to holi writt, si\u00fe God punishide Zacarie for he trowide not to his aungel; and more ben wordis of God \u00fean wordis of \u00feis aungel.

But at an early period it became, in England at least, a more honour|able appellation. In Fleta, the author of which wrote under Ed|ward I, the Apprentitius appears as the lowest kind of legal practitioner admitted to the king's courts;\u2014'in curia autem regi\u00e2 sunt servientes, narratores, attornati, et apprenticii ' (lib. II. cap. 37). In the reign of Edward II, the term seems to be used much in the same way as 'bar|rister' is now-a-days; thus the jurist, Andrew Horn (on whom see Selden's Dissertatio ad Fletam ), dedicates his treatise Speculum Justitiarum (Justi|tiariorum?) to the 'Apprentitii ad barras.' Spelman (Glossarium in voce ), says that the Apprentitius, after a course of legal training ex|tending over seven years, was per|mitted 'cancellos salutare,' i.e. to come up to the bar, and there to plead. He thus corresponded to the 'outer barrister' of modern times; and so completely is this the case, that Fortescue (quoted by Spelman), with Selden, Plowden, Sir Henry Finch, and Sir Edward Coke (quoted in Cowell's Interpre|ter ), speak of Apprentitius as being only another name for barrister-at|law. , wolen no not , E. procure in a cause bifore \u00feat \u00feei heeren it, and \u00feis cause to \u00feer witt ha\u00fe \u00fee part of ri&yogh;twisnes; for ellis \u00feei maden hemsilf avocatis a&yogh;ens treu\u00fee wi\u00fe \u00fee fend.

Chaucer says of his Pardoner (Pro|logue to Canterbury Tales),\u2014 'And thus with fained flattering and japes, He made the persone and the peple his apes.' And we read in Gower ( Confessio Amantis , lib. II),\u2014 'This Geta forth bejaped went, And yet ne wist he what it ment.' of childis gamen, as &yogh;if \u00feei weren foolis, and after \u00feis comen to mannis witt \u00feat holdi\u00fe al \u00feis foli.

With regard to the first, it must be remembered that our author wrote but a few years after the death of Edward III, the reviver of the Round Table, and the founder of the order of the Garter, whose reign was the culminating period in England of the spirit of Chivalry. Justing was then, and continued to be for a century and a half after|wards, the favourite amusement of persons of condition. It was usually practised with 'arms of courtesy,' that is, headless lances, and blunted swords without points; but some|times, as when certain knights un|dertook to maintain the honour of their country in a foreign land, wea|pons \u00e0 l'outrance were, though under regulations, employed, and most often with deadly effect. Chaucer gives us the whole order and regulation of a tournament in the Knight's Tale. (See Scott's Essay on Chivalry among his Miscellaneous Prose Works.) Shooting with the bow was an out-door occupation which was well-nigh universal among the mid|dle and lower classes in the four|teenth and fifteenth centuries. The men exercised in shooting regularly, to keep their hands in as archers. Even ladies, as the illustrations of old MSS. shew, were much given to the use of the bow, both with the sharp-headed arrow in the pur|suit of deer, and with the blunt arrow in bird-bolting. Wrestling was a popular amuse|ment with our forefathers as far back as the Saxon times; in the Middle Ages it is mentioned along with bull and bear baiting, putting the stone, throwing the bar, foot|ball, and the like. It does not ap|pear that they were sufficiently brutalized at that time to enjoy boxing. See Wright's Domestic Manners in England during the Mid|dle Ages. ; and \u00fees suen ofte more foli \u00fean doi\u00fe \n  \u00fee firste elde.
