Stow says of St. Paul's ( Survey , 1633, p. 354): 'There was also one great Cloyster, on the North side of this Church, invironing a plot of ground, of old time called Pardon Church-yard ; whereof Thomas More , Deane of Pauls , was eyther the first Builder, or a most especiall Benefactor, and was buried there. 'About this Cloyster, was artificially and richly painted the Dance of Machabre , or Dance of Death, commonly called the Dance of Pauls . . .  In this Cloyster were buried many Persons, some of Worship, and others of Honour: The Monuments of whom, in number and workmanship, passed all other that were in that Church..... 'In the midst of this Pardon Church-yard , was also a faire Chappell, first founded by Gilbert Becket , Portgrave, and principall Magistrate of this City, in the reigne of King Stephen , who was there buried. Thomas More [? he whose Tomb is named abuv, p. 71, l. 7], Deane of Pauls , before named, re-edified or new builded this Chappell, and founded three Chaplaines there, in the reigne of Henry the fifth.' This Pardon Church-yard of St. Paul's must not be confounded with that at  the Charter-House, of which Stow says: 'This house [the Charter-house ] he [Sir Walter Manny ] founded upon this occasion: A great Pestilence [the Black Death] entring this Iland, began first in Dorsetshire, then proceeded into Devonshire , Somersetshire , Glocestershire , and Oxfordshire , and at length came to London , and overspread all England , so wasting the people, that scarce the tenth person of all sorts was left alive, and Churchyards were not sufficient to receive the dead, but men were forced to chuse out certeine fields for burials: whereupon Ralph Stratford , Bishop of London, in the year 1348, bought a piece of ground, called No mans land , which he inclosed with a wall of Bricke, and dedicated for buriall of the dead, builded thereupon a proper Chapell, which is now enlarged, and made a dwelling-house: and this burying plot is become a faire Garden, retaining the old name of Pardon Church-yard .'
