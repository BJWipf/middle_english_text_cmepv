THE DEFERENCE BI TWENE DOMINIUM REGALE AND DOMINIUM POLITICUM ET REGALE. THER bith ij kyndes off kyngdomes, of the wich that on is a lordship callid in laten dominium regale , and that other is callid dominium politicum et regale . And thai diuersen in that the first kynge mey rule his peple bi suche lawes as he makyth hym self. And therfore he mey sett vppon thaim tayles and other imposicions, such as he wol hym self, with owt thair assent. The secounde kynge may not rule his peple bi other lawes than such as thai assenten unto. And therfore he mey sett vpon thaim non imposi|cions with owt thair owne assent. This diuersite is wel taught bi Seynt Thomas, in his boke wich he wrote ad regem Cipri de regemine principum . But yet it is more openly tredid in a boke callid compendium moralis philosophie , and sumwhat bi Giles in his boke de regemine principum . The childeryn of Israell, as saith Seynt Thomas, aftir that God hade chosen thaim in populum peculiarem et regnum sacerdotale , were ruled bi hym vndir Juges regaliter et politice , in to the tyme that thai desired to haue a kynge, as tho hade al the gentiles, wich we cal peynymes, that hade no kynge but a man that reigned vppon thaim regaliter tantum . With wich desire God was gretly offendyd, as wele for thair folie, as for thair vnkyndnes; that \n  sithyn thai had a kynge, wich was God, that reigned vppon thaim politekily and roialy, and yet wold chaunge hym for a kynge, a verray man, that wolde reigne vpon hem only roialy. And therfore God manassynge hem made them to be ferde bi thondres and o\u00feer gasteful thynges from the hevene. And whan thai wolde not therby lefe thair folissh desire, he charged \u00fee profet Samuel to declare vnto them the lawe of such a kynge as thai askyd; wich amonge o\u00feer thynges said that he wolde take from thaim thair lande and gyf it to his servantes, and sett thair childeryn in his cartis, and do to thaim such o\u00feer many harmeful thinges, as in the viij th chapiter of the first boke of kynges it mey apere. Wher as bi fore that tyme, while thai were ruled bi God roialy and politikely vndir Juges, it was not lefull to any man for to take from thaim any of thaire godis, or to greve thair childeren \u00feat hade not offendid. Wereby it mey appere that in tho dayis regimen politicum et regale was distyngued a regemine tantum regale ; and that it was bettir to the peple to be ruled politekely and roialy, than to be ruled only roialy. Seynt Thomas also in his said boke prasith dominium politicum et regale , bi cause the prince that reigneth bi such lordshippe mey not frely falle into tyrannye, as mey the prince that reigneth regaliter tantum . And yet thai both bith egall in estate and in poiar, as it mey lightly be shewed and provid by infallyble reason.", "1": "CHAPTER II. WHI OON KING REGNETH REGALITER, AND ANOTHER POLITICE ET REGALITER. HIT mey peraventur be mervellid be some men, whi on reaume is a lordeshippe only roialle, and the prince therof rulith it bi his lawe callid Jus regale ; and a nother kyngdome is a lordshippe roiall and politike, and the prince therof rulith hit bi a lawe callid Jus polliticum et regale ; sithin thes ij princes bith of egal estate. To this doute it mey be an|swerde in this maner. The first institucion of thes ij realmes vppon the incorperacion of thaim is cause of this diuersite. Whan Nembroth be myght for his owne glorie made and incorperate the first realme, and subdued it to hymself bi tyrannye, he wolde not have it gouernyd bi any o\u00feer rule or lawe, but bi his owne wille; bi wich and for the accom|plisshment \u00feerof he made it. And therfore though he hade thus made hym a realme, holy scripture disdeyned to call hym a kynge, quia rer dicitur a regendo ; wich thynge he did not, but oppressyd the peple bi myght, and therfore he was a tirraunt and callid primus tirrannorum . But holy write callith hym robustus benator coram Domino . Ffor as the hunter takyth the wilde beste for to sle and ete hym, so Nembroth subdued to hym the peple with myght, to haue \u00feer seruice and thair godis, vsing vppon thaim the lord|shippe that is callid dominium regale tantum . Aftir hym Belus that was first callid a kynge, aftir hym is \n  sone Ninus, and aftir hym other paynemes, \u00feat bi ensample of Nembroth made hem realmes, wolde not haue thaim ruled bi o\u00feer lawes then be ther owne wylles. Wich lawes ben right gode vndir gode princes, and thair kyngdomes bethe than most resembled to the kyngdome of God, wich reigneth vpon man rulynge hym bi his owne will. Wherfore mony cristen princes vsen the same lawe; and ther|fore it is that \u00fee lawes seyn, quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem . And thus I suppose first be gan in Realmes dominium tantum regale . But aftirwarde, whan mankynde was more mansuete, and bettir dis|posid to vertu, grete comunaltes, as was the felow|shippe that came in to this lande with Brute, willynge to be vnite and made a body pollitike callid a reawme, hauynge an hed to gouerne it;\u2014as aftir the saynge of the philisopher, euery comunalte vnyed of mony parties must nedis haue an hed;\u2014than they chese the same Brute to be \u00feer hed and kynge. And thai and he vpon this incorperacion, institucion, and onynge of hem self in to a reaume, ordenyd the same reaume to be ruled and justified by suche lawes as thai all wolde assent vnto; wich lawe therfore is callid polliticum , and bi cause it is ministrid bi a kynge, it is callid regale . Policia dicitur a poles , quod est plures, et ycos , scientia; quo regimen politicum dicitur regimen plurium scientia siue consilio ministratum . The kynge of Scottis reignith vppon is peple bi this lawe, videlicet , regemine politico et regali . And as Dio|dorus Siculus saith in is boke de priscis historiis , the reawme of Egipte is ruled bi the same lawe, and therfore the kynge therof chaungith not his lawes with owt the assent of his peple. And in like fourme as he saith is ruled the kyngdome of Saba in Felici Arabia , and the londe of Libie; and also the more parte of all the reawmes of Affrike. Wich maner rule and lordshippe the said Diodorus in that boke praisith gretly; ffor it is not only good for the prince, that mey therby \u00fee more surely do justice than bi is owne arbitrment; but it is also good for his peple \u00feat resseyue thair bi such justice as thai desire thaim self. Now as me semyth it is shewid openly ynough, whi on kynge reignith vpon is peple dominio tantum regali , and that other reignith dominio politico et regali ; ffor that on kyngdome be ganne of and bi the might of the prince, and that o\u00feer be ganne bi the desire and institucion of the peple of the same prince.", "2": "CHAPTER III. HERE BIEN SHEWED THE FRUYTES OF JUS REGALE AND THE FRUYTES OF JUS POLITICUM ET REGALE. AND how so be it that \u00fee Ffrenche kynge reignith vppon is peple dominio regali , yet Seynt Lowes some tyme kynge ther, nor eny of his progenitors sette neuer tayles or o\u00feer imposicion vppon the peple of \u00feat lande with owt the assent of \u00fee iij estates, wich whan thai bith assembled bith like to the courte of the parlement in Ingelonde. And this ordre kepte many of his successours in to late dayis, that Ingelonde men made suche warre in Ffraunce, that the iij estates durst not come to gedre. And than for \n  that cause and for gret necessite wich the Ffrench kynge hade of goode for the defence of \u00feat lande, he toke vpon hym to sett tayles and o\u00feer imposicions vpon the commons with owt the assent of the iij estates; but yet he wolde not sett any such charges, nor hath sette, vppon the nobles for fere of rebillion. And bi cause the commons \u00feer, though thai haue grucched, haue not rebellid or beth hardy to rebelle, the Ffrench kynges haue yerely sithyn sette such charges vpon them, and so augmented the same charges, as the same commons be so impouerysshid and distroyed, \u00feat thai mowe vnneth leve. Thai drinken water, thai eyten apples, with brede right browne made of rye; thai eyten no flesshe but yf it be right seldon a litle larde, or of the entrales and heydes of bestis slayn for the nobles and marchauntes of the lande. Thai weren no wolen, but yf it be a pouere cote vndir thair vttermest garnement, made of grete caunuas, and callid a frokke. Thair hausyn beth of lyke caunuas, and passyn not thair kne, wher fore thai beth gartered and ther theis bare. Thair wyfes and childeren gone bare fote; thai mowe in non o\u00feer wyse leve. For somme of thaim \u00feat were wont to pay to his lorde for his tenement, wich he hiryth by the yere, a scute, payith nowe to the kynge ouer \u00feat scute .v. scutes. Wher thurgh thai be arted bi necessite so to wacch, labour, and grubbe in the ground for thair sustenance, that thair nature is wasted, and the kynde of hem broght to noght. Thai gon crokyd, and ben feble, not able to fight, nor to defende \u00fee realme; nor thai haue wepen, nor money to bie thaim wepen with all. But verely thai liven in the most extreme pouertie and miserie, and yet dwellyn thai in on the most fertile reaume of the \n  worlde. Werthurgh the Ffrench kynge hath not men of his owne reaume able to defende it, except his nobles, wich beyren non such imposicions, and ther fore thai ben right likely of thair bodies; bi wich cause the said kynge is compellid to make his armeys and retenues for the defence of his lande of straungers, as Scottes, Spaynardes, Arrogoners, men of Almeyn, and of o\u00feer nacions, or ellis all his enymes myght ouerrenne hym; for he hath no defence of his owne except is castels and fortresses. Lo this is the frute of his Tus regale . Yf the reaume of Englonde, wich is an Ile, and therfor mey not lyghtly geyte soucore of other landes, were rulid vndir such a lawe, and vndir such a prince, it wolde be than a pray to all o\u00feer nacions \u00feat wolde conqwer, robbe, or deuouir it; wich was well provid in the tyme of the Bretons, when the Scottes and the Pyctes so bete and oppressid this lande, \u00feat the peple therof sought helpe of the Romayns, to whom thai hade be tributori. And when thai coude not be defende be thaym, thai sought helpe of the Duke of Bretayn tho called litle Bretayn, and grauntid ther|fore to make his brother Costantyne \u00feer kynge. And so he was made kynge here, and reigned many yeres, and his childirren aftir hym, of wich gret Artour was one of thair issue. But blessyd be God, this lande is rulid vndir a bettir lawe; and therfore the peple therof be not in such peynurie, nor ther by hurt in thair persons, but thai bith welthe, and haue all thinges nescessarie to the sustenance of nature. Wherfore thai ben myghty, and able to resiste the aduersaries of this reaume, and to beete o\u00feer reaumes that do, or wolde do them wronge. Lo this is the fruyt of Tus polliticum et regale , vndre wich we live. \n  Sumwhat now I haue shewid the frutes of both lawes, ut ex fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos .", "3": "CHAPTER IV. HERE IS SHEWED HOW THE REUENUES OF FFRAUNCE BYN MADE GRETE. SITHYN our kynge reignith vpon vs be lawes more fauerable and good to vs, \u00fean be the lawes by the whiche \u00fee Ffrench kynge rulith his peple, hit is reason \u00feat we be to hym more good and more profitable than be the sugettes of the Ffrench kynge vnto hym; wich it wolde seme that we be not, con|siderynge \u00feat his subiecttes yelden to hym more in a yere, than we do to owre soferayn lorde in ij yeres, how so be it \u00feat thai do so ayenst thar willes. Neuer the lesse when it is considerid, how a kynges office stondith in ij thynges, on to defende his reaume ayen \u00feair enemyes outwarde bi the swerde; an other that he defende his peple ayenst wronge doers inwarde bi justice, as hit apperith bi the said first boke of kynges; wich \u00fee Ffrench kynge dothe not, though he kepe Justice be twene subiet and subget; sithin he oppressith thaim more hym self, than wolde haue done all the wronge doers of \u00fee reaume, \u00feough thai hade no kynge. And sithyn it is a synne to gyve no meyte, drynke, clothynge or other almes to hem that haue nede, as shal be de|clared in the day off dome; how muche a greter \n  synne is it to take from the pore man is meyte, is drinke, his clothynge, and all that he hath nede off. Wich werely doth the Ffrench kynge to mony a thowsande of his subiectes, as it is be fore openly declared. Wich thynge \u00feough it be nowe colourid per jus regale , yet it is tyranne. Ffor, as Seynt Thomas saith, whan a kynge rulith his reaume only to his owne profite, and not to the good off is subiectes, he is a tyrant. Kynge Heroude reignid vppon \u00fee Jues dominio regali; yet when he slowe the childeren off Israell, he was in that a tyrant, though the lawes seen, quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem . Wherfore Acab, wich reigned vppon the childeren of Israell bi like lawe, and desired to haue hade Nabothe his subgectes vyne yerde, wolde not by that lawe take it ffrom hym, but proferid hym the value thereof. Ffor theys wordes seid to the pro|fete, predic eis jus regis , beth not ellis to say but, predic eis potestatem regis . Wher fore as ofte as such a kynge dothe any thynge ayenst the lawe of God, or ayenst \u00fee lawe off nature, he dothe wronge, not with stondynge the said lawe declared by the prophete. And it is so, that the lawe off nature woll in this case, \u00feat the kynge shulde do to his subgettes, has he wolde ben done to hym self, yff he were a subget; wich mey not be that he wolde be almost distroied as bith \u00fee commons off Ffraunce. Wherfore, al be it that the Ffrench kynges reuenues ben by suche meanes moche gratter than be the revenues wich \u00fee kynge owre souerayn lorde hath off vs, yet thai ben not goodly taken, and the myght of his reaume is nerehande distroyed ther by. By wich consideracion I wolde - nat that the kynges revenues of this reaume were made grette by any \n  such meane. And yet of necessite thai muste be gratter than thai bith at this day. And trewly it is veray necessarie that thay be alwey grete; and that the kynge haue habundantly wherewith his estate mey be honorably kepte ffor ryght mony causes, off wech some shall nowe be remenbred.", "4": "CHAPTER V. THE HARME THAT COMYTH OFF A KYNGES POVERTE. FFIRST, yff a kynge be pore, he shall bi nescessite make his expences, and by all \u00feat is necessarie to his estate, by creaunce and borowynge; wher through his creauncers wolle wynne vpon hym the iiij th or the v th pene of all that he dispendith. And so he shall lese whan he payith, the iiij th or the v th pene of his revenues, and thus be ther by alway porer and porer, as vser and chevisaunce encressith the pouerte off hym that borowith. His creauncers shul alway grucche ffor lake of thair paymente, and defame his highnes off mysgouernance, and defaute of kepynge of days; wich yf he kepe, he most borowe also much at the dayis, as he didd firste; ffor he shalbe than pouerer than he was by the value of the iiij th or v th parte of his first expences, and so be alway pouerer and pouerer, vnto the tyme he be the pouerest lorde of his lande. Ffor such maner of borowynge makith the grete lordis to \n  be pouerer than thair tenantes. What dishonour is this, and abatynge of the glorie of a kynge. But yet it is most to his vnsuyrte. For his subgettes woll rather goo with a lorde \u00feat is riche, and mey pay thair wages and expenses, then with thair kynge \u00feat hath noght in his purse, but thai most serue hym, yf thai wil do so, at thair owne dispenses. Item , yf the kynge be pouere, he shall of necessite make his giftes and rewardes by asseignementes, for wich he shall haue but litle thanke. For the pouere man hade leuer an c. marke in hande, then an c. li. bi asseignement, wich perauentur shall cost hym right miche or he can gete his payment, and per|auentur be neuer paid therof. And often tymes for lake of money the kynge shall be fayne to gyf awey his lande to such as wolde haue ben feyner of a c. li in hand, than of xl. li worth lande yerely, to the grete abatynge of his revenues and depopolacion of his reaume. But the grettest harme that comyth of a kynges pouerte is, that he shal bi necessite be arted to fynde exquysite meanes of geytinge of good; as to putt defaute in some of his subgettes \u00feat bith innocentes, and vpon the riche men more \u00feen the pore, by cause that he mey bettir pay; and to shew rigoure \u00feer as fauour awght to be shewid, and fauour \u00feer as rigour shuld be shewid, to per|version of Justice, and perturbacion of the peas and quiete of the reaume. For, as the philosepher saith in his Eytikes, Impossibile est indigentem operari bona . Hit nedith not now to specifie mo of the harmes wich comyth to a reaume bi the pouerte of \u00feer kynge, how be it thai bith mony mo than we haue shewid yet; for euery wise man mey se ham openly i now. But we most holde it for vndouted, \u00feat ther \n  mey no reaume prospere, or be worshipfull, vndir a poure kynge.", "5": "CHAPTER VI. ORDINANCE FFOR THE KYNGES ORDINARIE CHARGES. AND sithyn it is necessarie that the kynge be alway riche, wich may not be with owt he haue revenues sufficiant for the yerely mayntenance of his estate; it is behouefull that we furst esteme, what his erly charges and expences bith likely to drawe vnto. Ffor aftir that nedith his reuenues to be proporcioned; but yet thai nedun to be gretter than woll be the charges, for doute of soden cases, wich mey falle to hym and to his reaume. Ffor Seynt Bernarde saith, \u00feat yf a mannes ex|penses be egall to his livelode, a soden chaunce mey distroye his estate. The kynges yerely ex|penses stonden in charges ordinarie, and in charges extra ordinarie. His charges ordinary mey not be eschewed, and therfore it nedith \u00feat ther be lyvelode asseigned ffor the payment therof; wich lyvelode be in no wyse putte to no other vse. And yff it happen that any patent be made of any parte therof to o\u00feer vse, \u00feat thanne \u00feat patent be voide and of non effect. Wich thynge yff hit be ffermely estableshed, the kynges ordinarie charges mey alway be paid in hande, and the pro vision ffor hem mey alway be made in seson; wich shalbe worth to the kynge the \n  iiij th or the v th parte of the quantite of his expenses for ordinarie charges. This may in nothinge restrane the kyngis pover. Ffor it is no poiar to mowe aliene and put away; but it is power to mowe haue and kepe to hym self. As it is no poiar to mowe synne, and to do ylle, or to mowe to be seke, wex olde, or that a man may hurte hym self. Ffor all thes poiars comen of impotencie. And therfore thay mey properly by callid nown poiars. Wherfore the holy sprites and angels, \u00feat mey not synne, wex old, be seke, or hurte ham selff, haue more poiar than we, that mey harme owre selff with all thes defautes. So is the kynges power more, in that he may not put ffrom hym possescions necessaries for his owne sustenance, than yff he myght put ham ffrom hym, and aliene the same to his owne hurte and harme. Nor this is ayen the kynges prerogatiff, be wich he is exaltid above his subgettes; but rather this is to hym a prerogatiff. Ffor no man saue he mey haue ayen the lande \u00feat he hath onis aliened. This livelode asseigned ffor the ordinarie charges shall aftirwarde be neuer askid off the kyng, nor his highnes shall thynke ffor \u00feat, that he hath \u00fee more livelode to be given awey; but be reason hereoff he will \u00fee more restrayn his yeftis off o\u00feer off his livelod, considerynge \u00feat than it woll not be grette, and therfore he shall haue more nede off it then thai that will aske it. The ordenarie charges, wich \u00fee writer hereoff can nowe remenbr, be thies; the kynges housholde, his warderobe. And how so be it \u00feat the kynge liste now, or will hereaftir, make his howshold lesse than it was wonned to be; yet his highnes shall \u00fean haue therfore a bouute his persone, ffor his honour and suyrte, lordes, knyghtes, \n  and sqviers, and o\u00feer, in also grete nombr, or gretter than his howsolde was wonned to be, to his charges peraduentur also gretly, as his houshold well ruled was wonned to stonde hym inne. Wher fore here|inne it nedith not to considre or to purvey, but only ffor the kynges house, wich he may resume or chaunge in to his new maner, or other fourme at his pleasur, and as it shalbe thought aftir the seasons most expedient. The expenses off wich housholde mey sone be estemed by the wich off olde tyme haue be officers therin, and bi the clerkys off theschekquer. The secounde ordinarie charge is the payment off the wages and ffees off the kynges grete officers, his courtes, and his counsell. Wich charge woll alwey be grete, and thies men nedun to be alway redely payid. Ffor indigens in ham is not only vnworshipfull, but it mey do the most harme \u00feat mey falle of eny nede in any estate of the lande, aftir the kynges most grete estate. \u00dee thirde charge ordinarie is the payment of the kepyng of the marches, wher in we beyre moch gretter charges yerely than done the Scottis, wich often tymes is for the ffauour \u00feat we do to the persones \u00feat kepe ham, wich ffauoure \u00fee Scottis do not. The iiij th charge is the kepyng off Caleis, wich charge is welynoghe knowen. \u00dee v th charge is ffor the kynges werkes, off wich \u00fee yerely expenses mey not be es|temede, but yet \u00fee accoumptes off the clerkes off the werkes wollyn shewe \u00fee likenes \u00feeroff, wile \u00fee kynge makith no new werkes. The kepynge off the see I reken not amonge the ordinarie charges, how be it the charge \u00feeroff is yerely borne, bi cause it is not estimable, and the kynge hath therfore \u00fee subsidie off pondage and tonnage. Nor the lesse \n  be that reason pondage and tonnage mey not be rekenned as parcell off the revenues wich the kynge hath ffor the mayntenance off his estate, bi cause it aught to be applied only to \u00fee kepynge off the see. And though we haue not alwey werre vppon the see, yet it shalbe nescessarie \u00feat the kynge haue alway some ffloute apon the see, ffor the repressynge off rovers, sauynge off owre marchauntes, owre ffishers, and the dwellers vppon owre costes; and \u00feat the kynge kepe alway some grete and myghty vessels, ffor the brekynge off an armye when any shall be made ayen hym apon \u00fee see. Ffor thanne it shall be to late to do make such vessailles. And yet with owt thaym all the kynges navey shallnot suffice to borde with carrikkes and o\u00feer grete ves|sailles, nor yet to mowe breke a myghty ffloute gadered off purpose. Now, as I suppose, we haue rekened \u00fee grettest parte off the kynges ordinarie charges. Wherfore we woll considre next his extra ordinarie charges, also ferre as mey be possible to vs.", "6": "CHAPTER VII. THE KYNGES EXTRAORDINARIE CHARGES. THE kynges extraordinarie charges bith so casuelle, \u00feat no man mey knowe hem in certaynte. But yet he may esteme what somme thai bith not like to excede, but yff \u00feer ffall a case ouer moch exorbitant; \n  and than it shalbe reasone, and also necessarie, \u00feat all the reaume beyre ffor \u00feat case a synguler charge. Such off the said extraordinarie charges as the writer hereoff can now remenbr be theis. Ffirst \u00fee kyng shall often tymes sende owt off this lande his ambassatours, as well to the pope, as to diuerse kynges, prynces, and nacions; and o\u00feer while he shall sende his procuratours and messengers to the counselles generalles. Wich ambassatours, procura|tours, and messengers shall nede to be honerably accompanyed, and well be sene, alsowell ffor the worshippe off \u00fee reaume, as ffor the avaunsynge off \u00fee maters ffor wich thai shalbe sende, to \u00fee kynges right grete charge, wich shalbe more or lesse, aftir thair longe or shorte demure in thair viage. Item , the kynge shall beyre yerely charges vnknowen in re ceyvinge off ligates and messengers sende ffrom the pope, and off ambassatours sende ffrom kynges and o\u00feer princes, and also ffrom grete communalties bi yonde \u00fee see, wich will putt \u00fee kyng to grete expenses while thai bith here, and at thair depart|ynge thai most nedis haue grete giftes and rewardes; ffor \u00feat be sitith \u00fee kynges magnificence and liberalite, also it is necessarie ffor the worship off his reaume. Item , sithen it is not gode \u00feat he rewarde such as do, and shall do to hym seruice, or o\u00feer maner off pleasures, with \u00fee possescions and revenues of his crovne, nor with other possescions off his inherit|ance;\u2014ffor thai be moch more necessarie for the sustenance off his grete estate;\u2014hit shall ther fore be necessarie, \u00feat the kynge make such rewardes with money owt off his cofers, and \u00feat somme off hem haue so largely \u00feeroff, as thai mey bie thaim lande with all, yff thai will. Ffor be this meane \u00fee \n  kynges estate shall alwey be kept vnblemyshed. And off somme man is highnes shall haue more thanke ffor money then ffor lande; and also money is the most convenient rewarde to hym \u00feat hath not longe serued. This charge woll all wey be grete, and so inestimable grete, \u00feat in somme yere a grete lordes lyvelod shalnot suffice to beyre it, though he wolde selle grete parte \u00feerof. And trewly, when \u00fee kyng rewardith is servantes in this maner, he shewith grete ffauour to all his reaume. Item , it shall nede \u00feat the kyng haue such tresour, as he mey make new bildynges whan he woll, ffor his pleasure and magnificence; and as he mey bie hym riche clothes, riche furres, o\u00feer than be wonned to fall vndre \u00fee yerely charges off his warderober, rich stones, serpes, bauderikes, and o\u00feer juels and ornamentes conue|nyent to his estate roiall. And often tymes he woll bie riche hangynges and other apparell ffor his howses; vessaill, vestmentes, and o\u00feer ornamentes for his chapell; bie also horses off grete price, trappers, and do other suche nobell and grete costes, as bi sitith is roiall mageste, off wich it is not now possible to the writer hereof to remenbr the especial|liteis. Ffor yff a kyng did not so, nor myght do, he lyved then not like his estate, but rather in miserie, and in more subgeccion than doth a priuate person. Item , the kynge shall often tymes sende his comis|sioners in gret myght, and also his juges, to represse and punysh riatours and risers; ffor wich cause he shall odre whiles ride in his owne person myghtely accompanyed. Wich thynge wolnot be done with owt grete costes; ffor no man is bounde to serue hym in suche cases at his owne dyspenses. Item , yff ther come a sodayne armye vpon this londe by see \n  or by lande, \u00fee kyng most encomptre them with a lyke armye, or a gretter; ffor \u00fee expenses wheroff he shall not so sadanly haue any eyde off his peple. Wherfore he most than do the expences with money owt off his cofers, or put all is lande in jopardie. Loo now we haue remenbred grete parte off the kynges extraordinarie charges; and be ffore we haue shewid grete parte off his ordinarie charges. Wherfore now it is tyme \u00feat it be shewid, how the kynge mey haue revenues and livelode sufficient to beyre theis ij charges.", "7": "CHAPTER VIII. YFF THE KYNGES LIVELODE SUFFICE NOT, HIS SUBGETTES AUGHT TO MAKE HIT SUFFICIENT. HIT is shewid be ffore, how necessarie it is \u00feat livelod sufficient be asseigned ffor the kynges ordi|narie charges, and that the same livelod be only applied therto, and not aliened in tyme comynge. Ffor that asseignement mey in no wise hurte \u00fee kyng, considerynge \u00feat yff any parte off \u00fee revenues \u00feeroff remayne ouer the paiement of the same ordynarie chargis, that so remaynynge is the kynges owne money, wich he mey than imploye to o\u00feer vse at is owne pleasur. And it is vndouted that the kynge hath livelode sufficient wich mey be soo asseigned for his ordinarie charges. Wherfore we haue now no thyng ellis to be sercched, but what lyvelod \u00fee kyng hath ffor the payment off his charges extraor|dinarie, ouer so moche livelod as shalbe asseigned \n  ffor his charges ordinarie; and yff he haue not live|lod sufficient \u00feerto, how than his livelod mey be made sufficient. Ffor his reaume is bounde by right to susteyne hym in euery thyng necessarie to his estate. Ffor, as Seynt Thomas saith, Rex datur propter regnum, et non regnum propter regem. Wherfore all that he dothe owith to be referred to his kyngdome. Ffor though his estate be \u00fee highest estate temporall in \u00fee erthe, yet it is an office, in wich he mynestrith to his reaume defence and justice. And therfore he mey say off hym selff and off his reaume, as the pope saith off hym selff and off the churche, in \u00feat he writithe, seruus seruorum Dei. By wich reason, ryght as euery seruant owith to haue is sustenance off hym \u00feat he serueth, so aught \u00fee pope to be susteyned by the chirche, and the kyng by his reaume. Ffor nemo debet propriis expensis militare. And owre lorde saith, dignus est operarius cibo suo. Wherfore \u00fee appostill saith, commbnicet is qui cate&yogh;i&yogh;atur berbo, ei qui se cate&yogh;i&yogh;at, in omnibus bonis. Wherfore sithen euery reaume is bounde to susteyn is kyng, yet moch more be we bounde ther to, vppon whom owre kyng reignith by so ffauerable lawes as is be ffore de|clared.", "8": "CHAPTER IX. HERE HE SHEWITH THE PERELLIS THAT MEY COME TO THE KYNG BY OUER MYGHTYE SUBGETTES. BUT sithyn the said extraordinarie charges bith so vncertayne \u00feat thai be not estymable, hit is not \n  possible to putt in certayne, what lyvelod will yerely suffice to beyre ham. Wherfore we nede in this case to vse coniecture and ymaginacion, as to thynk that \u00feer is no lordis livelod in Englond sufficient to beyre the kynges extraordinare charges. Then nedith it \u00feat the kynges livelod, aboff such reuenues as shalbe asseigned for his ordinare charges, be gretter than the livelod off the grettest lorde in Englande. And perauenture, whan livelod sufficient ffor the kynges ordinarie charges is lemitted and asseigned therto, hit shall apere, that diuerse lordis off Englande haue also moch livelode off thair owne, as than shall remayne in the kynges handes ffor his extraordinarie charges; wich were inconvenient, and wold be to the kynge right dredefull. For than such a lord mey dispende more then the kynge, con|sideringe \u00feat he is charged with no such charges extraordinarie or ordinarie as is the kyng, except an houshold, wich is but litle in comparison off the kynges house. Wherfore yff it be thus, it shalbe necessarie, \u00feat ther be purveyid ffor the kyng moch gretter livelod than he hath yet. For manis corage is so noble, \u00feat naturally he aspirith to high thinges, and to be exaltid, and \u00feerfore enforsith hym selff to be alway gretter and gretter. Ffor wych the philo|sopher saith, omnia amamus sed principari maius. Wherof it hath comyn \u00feat oftyn tymes, when a subget hath hade also gret livelod as his prince, he hath anon aspired to \u00fee estate of his prince, wich by such a man mey sone be gote. Ffor the remenante off the subgettes off such a prince, seyng \u00feat yff so myghty a subget myght opteyne \u00fee estate off thair prince, thai shulde than be vndir a prince double so myghty as was thair old prince;\u2014wich encrease any subget \n  desirith, ffor his owne discharge off \u00feat he beyrith to the sustenance off his prince;\u2014and therfore wolbe right gladde to help such a subgett in his rebillion. And also such an enterprise is the more ffeseable, when such a rebell hath more riches than his souer|ayne lorde. Ffor the peple will go with hym \u00feat best mey susteyne and rewarde ham. This maner off doynge hath be so ofte practised nerehande in euery reaume, \u00feat thair cronicles be full off it. In the reaume off Ffraunce was neuer chaunge off thair kynge, sithyn it was ffirst inabyted by Ffrench men, but by \u00fee rebillion off such myghty subgettes; as Hyldericus kyng off Ffraunce, dissended off Clodone, wich was ffirst Cristen kyng off Ffraunce, was putt doune by Pepyne son to Carollus Marcellus, wich was the most myghty subget \u00feat into that tyme was euer sene in \u00fee reaume off Ffraunce. And aftirwarde Charles, discended off Carolus Magnus, sonne to the said Pepyne by ix. or by x. generacions, was put ffrom the kyngdome of Ffraunce by Hugh Capite, sonne to Hugo Magnus, Erle of Paris, wich tho was the myghtieste subgett off Ffraunce, and therfore create and callid Dux Ffranci\u00e6. And in owre dayis we haue sene a subgett off the Ffrench kynges in such myght, \u00feat he hath gyven bataill to the same kyng, and putt hym to flight, and aftirwad be segett hym beyng in Paris is grettest cete, and soo keppid thair, vnto \u00fee tyme his said kyng hade made such ende with hym, his adherentes, and fauctours, as he desired. We haue also sene late in owre reaume, somme off the kynges subgettes gyff hym bataill, by occasion \u00feat thair livelod and offices were \u00fee grettest off \u00fee lande, and ellis thai wolde not haue done soo. The Erlis of Lecestir and Glocestre, wich were \u00fee \n  grettest lordes off Englond, rose ayenest thair kynge Herre the iij de , and toke hym and his sonne prisoners in the ffelde. Wich maner off demeynynge the kyng off Scottis \u00feat last dyed dredyng to be practysed in his lande, putt owt off the same lande \u00fee Erle Douglas whos livelod and myght was nere hande equivalent to his owne, moved \u00feerto be no other cause, saue only drede off his rebyllion. The crony|cles off euery reaume, and in especiall off Spayne and Denmarke, bith full off such ensamples; and so bith also the bokis off kynges in holy scripture; wherfore it nedith not to write mor herein. And also it mey not be eschewid, but \u00feat the grete lordis off \u00fee lande by reason off nev dissentes ffallyng vnto ham, by reason also off mariages, purchasses, and o\u00feer titles, shall often tymes growe to be gretter than thai be now, and perauentur somme off hem to be off livelod and poiar like a kyng; wich shalbe right god ffor the lande while thai aspire to non hygher estate. Ffor such was \u00fee Duke of Lancastre, \u00feat warred \u00fee kynge off Spayne, on off the myghtiest kynges off Cristendome, in his owne reaume. But this is writun only to the entent \u00feat it be well vnder|stande, how necessarie it is \u00feat the kynge haue grete possescions, and peculier livelod ffor his owne suirte; namely, whan any of his lordis shull happen to be so excessyuely grete, as ther mought therby groue perell to his estate. For certanly ther mey no grettir perell growe to a prince, than to haue a subgett equepolent to hym selff.", "9": "CHAPTER X. HOW THAT THE CROVNE IS BESTE TO BE INDOWED. Now that the lykennes off the kynges charges ordinarie and extraordinarie bith shewid, and ouer that, how necessarie it is that he haue grete livelod aboff \u00fee same charges, in wich it nedyth \u00feat he excede gretly euery man off the lande, wych livelod vndoutedly he hath not at \u00feis day; hyt is therfore byhouefull \u00feat we now serch how the kyng mey haue such livelod; but ffirst, off what comodites it mey best be take. The kyng off Ffraunce myght not sumtyme dyspende off his demaynes, as in lorde|shippes, and o\u00feer patrimonie peculier, so mich as myght tho the kynge off England; wich mey well appere be that the qwene off Ffraunce hath but v. M l marke yerely to huyr douer, wher as the qwene off Englond hath x. M l marke. Ffor in tho dayis ther was but litle more off the reaume off Ffraunce in the kynges handes, but \u00feat parte wich is callyd the Ile off Ffraunce. Ffor all the remenant off the reaume as Burgonye, Normandye, Guyne, Cham|payne, Langdoke, and Fflaunders, with mony o\u00feer such grete lordshippes, were than in the handes off the Dussepers, and off o\u00feer princes and grete lordis. Ffor wych cause the gabell off the salt, and the quaterimes of the wynes were graunted to the kynge by the iij estates off Ffraunce, wych was no litill subsidie. Ffor ther is no man in Ffraunce \u00feat mey eyte salt, but yff he bie it off the kyng; and that is now sett to so grete prise, \u00feat the bushell, wich the \n  kyng bieth ffor iij d or iiij d , is solde to his peple ffor ij s and a j d , and other while more. And the iiij th pype off the wynes that be made in Ffraunce mey be no lityll thyng, sithyn the tyllyng off the vynes is the grettest comodite off the reame; but \u00feat como|dite we haue not in this lande. Wher fore ther is no parte off tho maners off subsidie \u00feat myght be gode ffor owre souerane lorde, but yff it were that he myght sell to his subgettes the salte \u00feat comyth hyder. In wich thynge he shall haue more groch|ynge off the peple than proffett. Ffor in Ffraunce the peple salten but lytill mete, except thair bacon, for thai wolde bie litil salte; but yet thai be arted to bye more salte than thai wolde. Ffor the kynges officers bryngen to thair houses euery yere, also moche salte as by thair coniecture is ressnable to the nombre off \u00fee men, women, and childeren that dwellen therin, ffor wich thai shall pay though thai wolnot haue so muche. This rule wolde be sore aborred in Englond, as well by the marchaunts \u00feat bithe wonned to haue thair ffredome in biynge and sellynge off salte, as by the peple \u00feat vsen moche to salte thair meytes more than do \u00fee Ffrenchmen; by occasion wheroff thai woll than at euery mele groche with the kynge, \u00feat entreteth hem more rygoursly than his progenitors haue done. And so his hyghnes shall haue \u00feeroff, but as hadd \u00fee man \u00feat sherid is hogge, muche crye and litil woll. In Fflaunders, and in o\u00feer lordeshippes off the Dukes off Burgoigne downewarde, he takith certayn imposicions made by hym selff vppon euery oxe, euery shepe, and vppon o\u00feer thynges solde; and also vppon euery vesaill off wyne, euery barrell off bere, and o\u00feer vitalles solde in his lordeshippes, wich is no litil revenue to hym; \n  but yet he dothe it maugre the peple, wich God defende \u00feat the kynge oure souerayn lorde shulde do vppon is peple, with owt thair grauntes or assent. Nertheles with thair assent suche maner off subsidie, yff \u00feer couude not be ffounde a better meane off \u00fee encressynge off the kynges revenues, were not vn|resnoble. Ffor therin and in the gabell off \u00fee salte, euery man shalbeyre \u00fee charge \u00feeroff eyegally. But yet I wolde not \u00feat suche a newe charge were put apon \u00fee peple in owre souerayn lordis dayis, with wich is progenitours charged hem neuer, yff a better remedie coude be ffounde. Kynge Salamon charged is peple with gretter ymposicions than thai were wonned to beyre be ffore his dayis. And by cause his sonne kynge Roboham wolde not ease hem theroff, the x. parties off the peple, devided in xii. parties, de partide ffrom hym, and chese hem a new kynge, and come neuer aftir \u00feat tyme vndre is sub|iection. Off wiche departyng God said hym selff aftirwarde, a me factum est istud . Wiche is an en|sample \u00feat it is not good a kynge to ouer sore charge his peple. Wherfore me thinkith, \u00feat yff \u00fee kynge myght haue is livelod ffor the sustenance off his estate in grete lordshippes, maneres, ffee ffermys, and such other demaynes, his people not charged, he shulde kepe to hym hollych thair hertes, excede in lordshippes all the lordes off his reaume, and ther shulde non off hem growe to be like vnto hym, wich thynge is most to be fered off all \u00fee worlde. Ffor then with in ffewe yeres \u00feer shulde not remeyne lordeshippes in is reaume, by wich \u00feai myght growe so grette. Ner thai myght growe soche be mariages, but yff the kyng wolde hit. Ffor to hym fallen all \u00fee grete mariages off his lande, wich he mey dispose \n  as hym liste. And by discente \u00feer is not like to ffalle gretter heritage to any man than to \u00fee kyng. Ffor to hym bith cosens \u00fee most and grettest lordes off \u00fee reaume. And by escheittes \u00feer mey not so muche lande fall to any man as to \u00fee kyng, by cause \u00feat no man hath so many tenantes as he; and also no man mey haue the escheittes off treson but hym selff. And be purchas, yff this be done, \u00feer shall no man so well encresse his livelod as the kyng. Ffor ther shall non off his tenantes aliene livelod with owt is licence, wheryn he mey best preferre hym selff. Nor \u00feer shall no livelod be kept so holl as \u00fee kynges, consideryng \u00feat he mey not onestly selle is lande, as o\u00feer men mey doo; and also his sellyng wolde be the hurte off all his reaume. Soche was \u00fee sellynge off Chirke and Chirkes landes, weroff neuer manne see a president, and God defende that any man see mo soche hereaftir. Ffor sellynge off a kynges livelod is propirly callid delapidacion off his crowne, and therfore is off gret infame. Now we haue ffounde vndoutably, what maner revenuez is best ffor the indowment off the crowne. But sithyn it is said be fore, \u00feat the kyng hath not at this day sufficiant therto, it is most convenient that we nowe serch, how is hyghnes mey haue sufficiant off suche revenues, wich we ffounde now best ther fore.", "10": "CHAPTER XI. HERE IS SHEWID, WHAT OFF THE KYNGES LIVELOD GEVEN AWEY, MEY BESTE BE TAKEN A GEYN. THE holy patriarke Joseph, while he, vndr Pha|raho kyng, gouerned \u00fee lande off Egipte, rulid and so entredid \u00fee peple \u00feeroff, \u00feat thai graunted to pay, and paid to the same kynge, the v th parte of thair graynes, and off all o\u00feer thynge that growed to thaim yerely off \u00fee erthe; wich charge thai berun yet, and euer shall beyre. Wherthro thair prince, wich now is the Saudayn off Babilon, is on off the myghtyest princes off \u00fee worlde; and that notwithstondynge \u00fee same Egipciens bith the most riche commons \u00feat liven vndre any prince. Wherby we bith lerned \u00feat it shalnot only be goode to owre prince, but also to vs selff, that he be well indowed; ffor ellis the patriarke wolde not haue made such a trety. The Ffrench kyng in on thynge, \u00feat is to say in wyne, takyth more off is peple than dothe \u00fee Saudan; ffor he takith \u00fee iiij th peyne \u00feeroff. But yet he takith no thynge off thair graynes, wolles, or off any other gode \u00feat growith to hem off thair lande. The kynge owre souerayn lorde hade be tymes, sithen he reigned vpon vs, livelod in lord|shippes, landes, tenementes, and rentes, nerehand to the value off \u00fee v th parte off is reaume, aboff the possescions off \u00fee chirche. Off wich livelod, yff hit hade abiden still in his handes, he hade ben more myghty in good revenues than any off \u00fee said ij kynges, or any kyng \u00feat now reigneth vppon cristen \n  men. But this was not possible to haue ben done. Ffor to some parte \u00feeroff the eyres off thaim \u00feat some tyme owed it be restored; some bi reason off tayles, some bi reason off o\u00feer titles, wich the kyng hath considered and thought hem good and reson|able. And some off \u00fee said livelod is god grase hath geuen to such as haue serued hym so notably, \u00feat as thair renounne wolbe eternall, so it be sate the kynges magnyficence to make thair rewardes euerlastynge in their heyres, to thair perpetuall memorie and honour. And also the kyng hath geven parte off this livelod to his moste worshipfull brotherryn, wich not only haue serued hym in the maner ffor said, but bith also so nygh in blode to his highnes, that it be satte not is magnificence to haue done in o\u00feer wyse. Neuerthelesse somme men haue done hym seruice, ffor wych it was reson|able \u00feat his grase hade rewarded hem; and ffor lakke off money, the kyng than rewarded \u00feam with lande. And to some men he hath done in lyke wyse aboff thair merites, through ymportunite off thair suyttes. And it is supposed \u00feat some off hem haue goton an c. li. worth lande, \u00feat wolde haue holde hym content with cc. li. in money, yff thai myght haue hade it in hande. Wherfore it is thought, \u00feat yff suche gyftis, and namely tho wich haue be made inconsideratle, or aboff the merytes off hem that haue thaim, were refourmed; and thai rewarded with money, or offices, and some with livelode terme off lyff, wich aftir thair dethis wolde than retorne to the Crowne, \u00fee kyng shulde haue suche livelod as we now seke ffor, sufficiante ffor the mayntennance off his estate. And yff it wolde not than be so gret, I holde it for \n  vndouted, \u00feat the people off his lande woll be well wyllunge to graunte hym a subsidie, vppon suche comodites off his reaume as bith be ffore specified, as shall accomplishe that wich shall lakke hym off such livelod; so that is highnes woll establyshe \u00fee same livelod than remaynynge, to abide perpetuelly to his crowne, with owt translatynge \u00feeroff to any o\u00feer vse. Ffor ellis whan \u00feat shall happen hereaftir to be gyven awey, it shall nede \u00feat is commons be charged with a newe subsidie, and thus be kept alway in pouerte.", "11": "CHAPTER XII. HERE IS SHEWID WHAT HARME WOLDE COME TO ENGLAND, YFF THE COMMONS THER OFF WERE POUERE. SOME men haue said \u00feat it were good ffor the kyng, \u00feat the commons off Englande were made pore, as be the commons off Ffraunce. Ffor than thai wolde not rebelle, as now thai done oftentymes; wich the commons off Ffraunce do not, nor mey doo; ffor thai haue no wepen, nor armour, nor good to bie it with all. To theis maner off men mey be said with the phylosopher, ad pauca respicientes de facili enunciant . This is to say, thai that see but ffew thynges, woll sone say thair advyses. Ffor soth theis ffolke consideren litill the good off the reaume off Englond, wheroff the myght stondith most vppon archers, wich be no ryche men. And yff thai were made more pouere than thai be, thai shulde not \n  haue wherwith to bie hem bowes, arroes, jakkes, or any o\u00feer armour off defence, wherby thai myght be able to resiste owre enymes, when thai liste to come vppon vs; wich thai mey do in euery side, con|siderynge \u00feat we be a Ilelonde; and, as it is said be fore, we mey not sone haue soucour off any o\u00feer reaume. Wherfore we shull be a pray to all owre enymyes, but yff we be myghty off owre selff, wich myght stondith most vppon owre pouere archers; and therfore thai nedun not only haue suche able|ments as now is spoken off, but also thai nedun to be much excersised in shotynge, wich mey not be done with owt ryght grete expenses, as euery man experte \u00feer in knowith ryght well. Wherfore \u00fee makyng pouere of \u00fee commons, wich is \u00fee makyng pouere off owre archers, shalbe \u00fee distruccion of the grettest myght off owre reaume. Item , yff pouere men mey not lightly rise, as is the openion of thes men, wich ffor \u00feat cause wolde haue \u00fee commons pouere; how than, yff a myghty man made a rysinge shulde he be repressed, whan all the commons ben so pouere, \u00feat aftir such openyon thai mey not ffeght, and be \u00feat reason not helpe the kyng with ffeghtynge? And whi makith the kynge \u00fee com|mons euery yere to be mustered; sithen it were god thai hade non harnes nor were able to ffight? O, howe vnwyse is \u00fee oppenyon off thes men; ffor it mey not be mayntened be any reason! Item , whan any rysinge hath be made in this londe be ffor theis dayis by commons, the pouerest men \u00feeroff haue be \u00fee grettest causers and doers ther in. And thryfty men haue ben loth therto, ffor drede off lesynge off thair gode. But yet oftentymes thai haue goo with thaym, through manasheynge \u00feat \n  ellis the same pouere men wolde haue toke thair godes, wher in it semyth \u00feat pouerte hath be \u00fee holl cause off all suche rysynges. The pouere man hath be sturred \u00feerto be occasion off is pouerte, for to gete gode and \u00fee riche men haue gone with hem, be cause thai wolde not be pouere be lesynge off \u00feer gode. What than wolde ffall, yff all the commons were pouere? Trewly it is lyke that this lande then shulde be like vnto \u00fee reaume off Boeme, wher the commons ffor pouerte rose apon the nobles, and made all thair godis to be comune. Item , hit is the kyngis honour, and also is office, to make is reaume riche; and it is dishonour whan he hath but a pouere reaume, off wich men woll say \u00feat he reigneth but vppon beggers. Yet it were moch gretter dishonour, yff he ffounde is reaume riche, and then made it pouere. And it were also gretly ayenest his conciens, \u00feat awght to defende hem and her godis, yff he toke ffro hem thair godis with owt lafull cause; ffrom the infame wheroff God defende owre kyng, and gyff hym grase to augmente is reaume in riches, welth, and prosperite, to his per|petuell laude and worshippe. Item , the reaume off Ffraunce givith neuer ffrely off thair owne gode will any subsidie to thair prince, be cause \u00fee commons \u00feeroff be so pouere, as thai meynot give any thyng off \u00feair owne godis. And the kyng ther askith neuer subsidie off is nobles, ffor drede \u00feat yff he charged hem so, thai wolde confedre with \u00fee com|mons, and perauentur putt hym doune. But owre commons be riche, and \u00feerfore thai give to thair kynge, at somme tymes quinsimes and dessimes, and ofte tymes o\u00feer grete subsidies, as he hath nede ffor \u00fee gode and defence off his reaume. How gret \n  a subsidie was it, when the reaume gaff to thair kyng a quinsime and a desime quinqueniale, and the ix th fflese off thair wolles, and also the ix th shefe off \u00feer graynes, ffor the terme off v. yere. This myght thai not haue done, yff thai hade ben im|pouershed be thair kyng, as be the commons off Ffraunce; nor such a graunte hath be made by any reaume off cristendome, off wich any cronicle makith mencion; nor non o\u00feer mey or hath cause to do so. Ffor thai haue not so much ffredome in thair owne godis, nor be entreted by so ffauerable lawes as we be, except a ffewe regions be ffore specified. Item , we se dayly, how men \u00feat haue lost thair godis, and be ffallen into pouerte, be comme anon robbers and theves; wich wolde not haue ben soche, yff pouerte hade not brought hem \u00feerto. Howe many a theff then were like to be in this lande, yff all the com|mons were pouere. \u00dee grettest surete trewly, and also the most honour \u00feat mey come to the kynge is, \u00feat is reaume be riche in euery estate. Ffor nothyng mey make is people to arise, but lakke off gode, or lakke off justice. But yet sertanly when thay lakke gode thai woll aryse, sayng that thai lakke justice. Neuer \u00fee les yff thai be not pouere, thay will neuer aryse, but yff \u00feer prince so leve justice, that he give hym selff all to tyranne.", "12": "CHAPTER XIII. ONLY LAK OFF HARTE AND COWARDISSE KEPEN THE FFRENCHEMEN FFRO RYSYNGE. POUERTE is not the cause, whi the commons off Ffraunce rise not ayen thair souerayn lorde. Ffor \u00feer were neuer people in \u00feat lande more pouere, then were in owre tyme the commons off the contre off Caux, wich was tho almost diserte ffor lakke off tillers; as it now well apperith be the new husbondry \u00feat is done \u00feer, namely in grobbyng and stokkyng off treis, busses, and groves, growen whill we were ther lordes off the contray. And yet the said commons off Caux made a mervelous gret rysinge, and toke owre townis, castelles, and ffortresses, and slowe owre capitans and soudiours, at soche a tyme as we hade but ffewe men off werre lyinge in \u00feat contray. Wich provith \u00feat it is not pouerte \u00feat kepith Ffrenchmen ffro rysinge, but it is cowardisse and lakke off hartes and corage, wich no Ffrenchman hath like vnto a Englysh man. It hath ben offten tymes sene in Englande, \u00feat iij. or iiij. theves ffor pouerte haue sett apon vj or vij trewe men, and robbed hem all. But it hath not bene sene in Ffraunce, \u00feat vj. or vij. theves haue be hardy to robbe iij. or iiij. trewe men. Wherfore it is right selde \u00feat Ffrenchmen be hanged ffor robbery, ffor thai haue no hartes to do so terable an acte. Ther bith therfore mo men hanged in Englande in a yere ffor robbery and manslaughter, then \u00feer be hanged in Ffraunce ffor such maner of crime in vij yeres. \n  Ther is no man hanged in Scotlande in vij yere to gedur ffor robbery. And yet thai ben often tymes hanged ffor larceny, and stelynge off good in the absence off \u00fee owner \u00feeroff. But \u00feer hartes serue hem not to take a manys gode, while he is present, and woll defende it; wich maner off takynge is callid robbery. But \u00fee Englysh man is off ano\u00feer corage. Ffor yff he be pouere, and see another man havynge rychesse, wich mey be taken ffrom hym be myght, he will not spare to do so, but yff \u00feat pouere man be right trewe. Wherfore it is not pouerte, but it is lakke off harte and cowardisse, that kepith the Ffrenchmen ffro rysynge.", "13": "CHAPTER XIV. HERE HIT IS SHEWID, WHI IT NEDITH \u00feAT THER BE A RESUMPCION, AND A GRAUNT OFF GODE MADE TO THE KYNGE. THIS serche wich we nowe haue made, ffor to vnderstonde how harmefull it wolde be to the kynge, and to his reaume, yff his commons were pouere, hath be a digression ffrom the mater in wich we labour; \u00feat is to say, ffor to vndirstonde howe the kyng mey best haue sufficient and perdurable livelod ffor the sustentacion off his estate. Wherfore it be houyth \u00feat we nowe resorte to the poynte in wich we lafte, wich, as I remenbr, was this. We ffounde be grete causes, \u00feat it was nedefull, \u00feat all suche giftes \n  as haue be made off the kynges livelod inconsederatly, as not deseruet, or aboff the meretes of hym \u00feat haue getun hym, were refourmed; so as thai wich haue done any seruice, be not vnrewarded. Wich thynge, as me thynkith, mey not perfitly be done, withowt a generall resumpcion, made be auctorite off parlement; and \u00feat ther be gyven to the kynge by the same auctorite, a grete subsidie, with wich is hyghnes, be \u00fee advise off his counsell, mey rewarde tho \u00feat haue deserued rewardes, and awght not \u00feer|fore to haue parte off his revenues, by wich is estate moste nedis be mayntened; or awght not haue so moch off \u00fee revenues, as thai haue now, or not so grete astate in the same. Considerynge \u00feat all such gyvinge awey off the kynges livelod is harmefull to all is legemen, wich shall \u00feerby, as is be ffore shewid, be arted to a newe charge ffor \u00fee sustenance off is estate. But yet, or any suche resumpcion be made, it shalbe gode \u00feat a worshipfull and a notable coun|sell be stableshed, be the advise off wich all new gyftes and rewardes mey be modered and made, as yff no such gyftes or rewardes had be made be ffor this tyme. Provided alway, that no man be harmyd, be reason off such resumpcion, in the arrerages off such livelod as he shall \u00fean haue, wich shall renne aftir \u00feat resumpcion, and bi fore \u00fee said new giftes and rewardes. And whan such a counsell is ffully create and estableshed, hit shalbe gode \u00feat all sup|plicacions wich shalbe made to \u00fee kynge ffor any gifte or rewarde, be sende to \u00fee same counsell, and \u00feer debatid and delibered; ffirst whether \u00fee supliant haue deserued such rewarde as he askith; and yff he haue deserued hit, yet it nedith \u00feat it be delibered, whether the kynge mey gyve such rewarde as he \n  askith off his revenues, savynge to hym selff sufficiant ffor the sustenance off his estate. Ffor ellis such givinge were no vertu, but a spice of prodigalite, and as ffor so moch it were delapidacion off his crowne. Wherfore no priuat person woll, be reason off libera|lite, or off rewarde, so abate is owne livelod, as he mey not kepe such estate as he did be ffore. And trewly it were bettir, \u00feat a priuat person lakked is rewarde wich he hath well deserued, then that be his rewarde \u00fee gode publike and all the lande were hurte. Wherfore to eschewe theis ij harmes, it mey then be advised be the counsell, how such a person mey be rewarded with office, money, mariage, ffraunches, priuelage, or such o\u00feer thynge, off wich \u00fee crowne hath grete riches. And verely yff this ordre be kept, the kynge shalnot be greved be im|portunite of suytours, nor thai shall be importunite or brocage optayne any vnresonable desires.

And trewly such a contenuall counsell mey wel be callid, multa consilia , ffor it is ofte, and euere day counsellith.", "14": "CHAPTER XV. HOW THE KYNGES COUNSELL MEY BE CHOSEN AND ESTABLESHED. THE kyngis counsell was wonned to be chosen off grete princes, and off the gretteste lordes off \u00fee lande, both spirituelles and temporellis, and also off o\u00feer men that were in grete auctorite and offices. Wich lordes and officers had nere hande also mony maters off thair owne to be treded in the counsell, as hade \u00fee kynge. Wherthrough, when thai come to gedre, thai were so occupied with thair owne maters, and with the maters off thair kynne, ser|uantes, and tenantes, \u00feat thai entendet but litle, and o\u00feer while no thynge, to \u00fee kynges maters. And also \u00feer were but ffewe maters off the kynges, but yff \u00fee same maters toucheden also \u00fee said coun|sellers, thair cosyns, \u00feer seruantes, tenantes, or such o\u00feer as thai owed ffauor vnto. And what lower man was \u00feer sytinge in \u00feat counsell, \u00feat durste say ayen the openyon off any off the grete lordis? And whi myght not then men make be meanes off cor|rupcion somme off the seruantes and counsellers off somme off the lordes to moue the lordes to par|ciallite, and to make hem also ffauorable and parcial as were the same seruantes, or the parties \u00feat so moved hem? Then couude no mater treted in the counsell be kept prive. Ffor the lordes oftentymes tolde ther owne counsellours and seruantes, that hade suyd to hem ffor tho maters, how thai had sped in ham, and who was ayen ham. How mey \n  \u00fee kyng be counsellyd to restrayne gyvinge a wey off his londe, off gyvinge off offices, corodeis, or pencions off abbeyis, by suche grete lordes to o\u00feer menys seruantes, sithyn thay most desire such giftes ffor thaim selff, and thair seruantes? Wich thynges considered, and also mony o\u00feer wech shall be shewid hereaftir, hit is thought gode, that \u00fee kynge had a counsell chosen and estableshed in the fourme that ffolowith, or in some o\u00feer ffourme like \u00feerto. Ffirst, \u00feat ther were chosen xij spirituell men, and xij temporell men, off \u00fee wysest and best disposed men \u00feat can be ffounde in all the parties off this lande; and that thai be sworne to counsell the kynge aftir a ffourme to be devysed ffor \u00feer owthe. And in especiall, \u00feat thai shall take no ffee, nor clothynge, nor no rewardes off any man, except only off \u00fee kynge; like as \u00fee Justices off \u00fee kynges benche, and off \u00fee Common place be sworne, when thai take ther offices. And \u00feat thes xxiiij. be alway counsellers, but yff \u00feer be any defaute ffounde in hem, or \u00feat hit lyst the kynge, be the advise off \u00fee more parte off hem, chaunge any off hem. And \u00feat euery yere be chosen be \u00fee kynge iiij. lordes spirituell, and iiij lordes temporall, to be ffor \u00feat yere off \u00fee same counsell, in like ffourme as \u00fee said xxiiij ti shall be. And that thai all haue an hed, or a cheeff to rule \u00fee counsell, on off \u00fee said xxiiij ti , and chosen be the kynge, havynge is office at the kynges pleasur; wich mey thanne be callid, Capitalis consiliarius . It shall not be necessarie, \u00feat the xij spirituell men off this covnsell, haue so gret wages as the xij temporall men; be cause thai shull not nede to kepe an houshold in thair contray, while thai ben absent, as the temporell men moste nedes \n  doo, ffor thair wyffes and childeren. By wich con|sideracion the spirituell juges in the courte off par|liment off Parys, taken but cc. ffrankes by \u00fee yere, where as \u00fee temporell juges \u00feeroff taken by the yere ccc. ffrankes. The said viij. te lordes also, wich be reason off \u00feer baronyes and estates bith to \u00fee kyng, consiliari nati , and \u00feerfore awghton to counsell hym at all tymes when he woll, nede not to haue gret wages ffor thair attendance to is covnsell, wich shall last but ffor a yere. Ffor temporell men, wich be reason off \u00feer enheritaunce and livelod bith made shyreffes ffor a yere, taken off \u00fee kynge litle, and all most nothyng ffor thair seruice off \u00feat yere. And thoughe \u00feat wages off the said xxiiij. ti coun|sellers seme a newe and a grete charge to \u00fee kynge, yet when hit is considered, how gret wages the grete lordes and other men, wych were off the kynges counsell in tymes passede, toke ffor thair attendance therto, wich maner off counsell was nothynge so behouefull to the kyng and to his reaume as this will be, wich wages shall than forthwarde cesse; \u00fee wages off \u00fee xxiiij. ti counsellours shall apere no gret charge to the kynge. And I can suppose, \u00feat some kynges be ffor this tyme, haue gyven to some on man \u00feat hath serued hym, also moche livelod yerely, as the said wages wyll com to. And if the same wagis be thought to grete charge vnto \u00fee kyng, \u00fee forsaid counsellours mowe be in lesse nowmbre, as to be xvj counsellours off privatis personis, with ij lordes spirituell, and ij lordes temporell; so as then thai be in all but xx. ti persones. Thies counsellors mowe contenually, at soche owres as shal be as|seigned to thaym, comune and delibre vppon the materis of defeculte that ffallen to the kynge; and \n  then vppon \u00fee materes off \u00fee pollycye off \u00fee reaume; as how \u00fee goyng owt off \u00fee money may be re|strayned, how bullyon mey be brought in to \u00fee lande, how also plate, juelles, and mony late borne owt, mey be geytun ageyn; off wich right wyse men mowe sone fynde the meanes. And also how \u00fee prises off marchaundise growen in this lande mey be holde vp and encressed, and the prises off mer|chandyses browght in to this lande abatid. How owre nauy mey be mayntened and augmented, and vppon suche o\u00feer poyntes off police, to the grettest profyte and encresse, \u00feat euer come to this lande. How also \u00fee lawes mey be amendet in suche thynges as thay neden reformacion in; wher through \u00fee par|lementes shall mowe do more gode in a moneth to \u00fee mendynge off the lawe, then thai shall mowe do in a yere, yff \u00fee amendynge \u00feeroff be not debatyd, and be such counsell ryped to thair handes. \u00feer mey be off this covnsell, when thai liste come \u00feerto, or \u00feat thai be desired be \u00fee said counsellours, \u00fee grete officers off \u00fee lande, as Chaunceler, tresourer, and prive seell; off wich \u00fee chaunceler, when he is present, mey be presydent, and haue \u00fee suppreme rule off all \u00fee counsell. Also the Juges, the Barones off \u00fee exchequier, \u00fee clerke off the rolles, and suche lordes as \u00fee forsaid counsellours woll desire to be with thaym for materes off gret deficulte, mey be off this counsell when thai be so desyred, and ellis not. All o\u00feer materes wich shall conserne this counsell, as when a Counsellour dyeth, how a new counsellour shall be chosen, how mony owres off the day this counsell shall sytt, when thai shall haue any vaca|sion, how longe any off hem mey be absent, and how he shall haue his leue, with all o\u00feer artycles \n  necessarye ffor the demeynynge and rule off this counsell, mowe be conseyued be layser, and putt in a boke, and that boke kept in this counsell as a registir or a ordinarye, howe thai shall doo in euery thynge.", "15": "CHAPTER XVI. HOW THE ROMAYNES PROSPERED WHILES THAI HADE A GRETE COUNSELL. THE Romaynes, while thair counsell callid \u00fee senate was gret, gate, through \u00fee wysdome off that counsell, the lordshippe off gret partye of the world. And aftirward Julyus, thair ffirst emperowre, coun|selled by \u00fee same senate, gate the monarchie ner|hande off all \u00fee world. Wherthrough Octavian, \u00feer secounde emperour, commounded all \u00fee world to be discribed as subget vnto hym. But aftir this, when yll dysposed emperours, as Nero, Domician, and o\u00feer had slayn grete parte off \u00fee senatours, and dyspiced the counsell off \u00fee senate, the estate off \u00fee Romans and off \u00feer emperours be ganne to fall doune, and hath ffallen alwey sythyn, in to suche decay, \u00feat nowe the lordeshippes off \u00fee emperour bith not so gret, as be \u00fee lordeshippes off some kynge, wich, while \u00fee senate was hole, was subget to \u00fee emperour. Be wich ensample it is thought, \u00feat yff the kyng haue such a Counsell as is beffore specified, his lande shall not only be ryche and welthy, as were \n  \u00fee Romans, but also is hyghnes shalbe myghty, and off poiar to subdue his ennemyes, and all o\u00feer that he shall liste to reygne uppon. Off such ensamples mony of the bokes off cronycles be full; and in especiall \u00fee cronycles off \u00fee Lacidemonies, and off \u00fee Authenences, wich, whill thai prospered, were best counselled, and most dyd aftir counsell off any people off \u00fee world, excepte the Romayns. But when thai lafte such counsell, thai ffell into non poiar and pouerte; as off the Cite off Athenes it mey well apere, be that it is nowe but a poure vilage, and some tyme was the moste worshipfull Cyte off Grece.", "16": "CHAPTER XVII. HERE FOLOWETHE ADUERTYSMENTES FOR THE GEUYNG OF THE KYNGES OFFYCES. YFF it woll lyke \u00fee kyng to gyff non office, in to the tyme \u00feat his entente therin be comened with his counsell, and thair opiniyon by his hyghnes vnder|stonde in the same, he shall mowe so rewarde his seruantes with offices, as ther shall be lityll nede to gyff hem moch off his livelod, and his offices shall then be geuen to soche as shall only serue hym selff. Wher through he shall haue than a greter myght, and a garde off his officers, when he liste to call thaym, than he hath nowe off his o\u00feer ffeed men vndre the astate off lordes. Ffor the myght off \u00fee lande, aftir the myght off \u00fee grete lordes \u00feeroff, \n  stondith most in \u00fee kynges officers. Ffor thai mowe best rule \u00fee contreis wher as \u00feer offices ben, wich is in euery partie off \u00fee lande. A pouere baylyff mey do more in his bayille, then any man off his degre dwellynge with in his office. Some fforester off \u00fee kynges, that hath non o\u00feer livelod, mey brynge moo men to \u00fee ffelde well areyed, and namely ffor sho|tynge, then mey some knyght or Squyer off ryght gret lyuelod, dwellynge be hym, and hauynge non offyce. What than mey gretter officers do, stewardes off gret lordeshippes, reseyvors, constables off Castels, maystir fforesters, and such o\u00feer officers; be sydis the hygher offycers, as Justices off fforestes, Justices and Chambirlayns off Contreis, \u00fee warden off \u00fee portes, and such o\u00feer? Ffor sothe it is not lyghtly estymable, what myght \u00fee kynge may haue off is officers, yff euery off hem hade but on office, and serued non o\u00feer man but \u00fee kynge. Nor hit is ease to be estemed, howe mony men mey be rewarded with offices, and how gretly, yff thai be discretly geuen. The kynge givyth mo than M ll offices, be sydes tho \u00feat my lorde \u00fee prince geuyth, off wich I reken \u00fee officers, as the kynges officers. Off thes officers some mey dispende by \u00fee yere, by reason off is office, cc. li., some a c.li., some a c. marc, some xl. li., some l. marc, and so downwarde. So as \u00fee lest off hem, \u00feough he be but a parker, takynge but ij d on a dey, yet he hath be \u00fee yere iij. li. x d , be sydes his dwellynge in \u00fee logge, his cowe ffor is mylke, and such o\u00feer thynge goynge abowte hym, and the ffees off is office, so as \u00feat office is to hym also profitable as wolde be a c.s. off ffee or rente, wich is a feyre lyuynge ffor a yoman. How mony men then off euery estate, and off euery degre, and how gretly, \n  mey the kynge rewarde with offices, with owt gyuynge awey off his livelod. Ffor soth the grettest lordes livelod in Englande mey not suffice to rewarde so many men, though he wolde departe hit euery dell amonges is seruantes; nor ij. the gretteste lordes off Englond mey make so gret a myghte as \u00fee kynge mey haue only off his officers, yff thai were holliche and only is seruantes, and euery off hem had but on office. To this sane suche lordes and o\u00feer men, such as axen off \u00fee kyng offices ffor thair seruantes, that thai and all thair seruantes shall alwey serue \u00fee kynge, and is officers shul do hym the bettir seruyce, by reason thei bith in \u00feer seruice; ffor thai woll helpen hym to do so, and suffre non in thair companye, but suche as woll do so. Wher to may be said, that it is trewe thai shall do the kyng seruice while thai be in thair companie; but so shulde thai haue done, though the kynge had neuer made thaym his officers. Wher fore \u00fee kynge shal not be the bettir served, \u00feat he hath yeuen his offices to thair seruantes, but ra\u00feer worse. Ffor owre lorde said, Remo potest duobus dominis seruire . And so \u00fee kynge shall lese the offices, as ffor any syngular service he shall haue ffor hem, or \u00feat the same officers shulde thynke them selff by hold vnto the kynge ffor \u00feer offices, wich is hyghnes hath yeuen them at \u00fee contemplacion off \u00feer maisters, and ffor no reward off any seruice \u00feat thai haue done, or shul doo vnto hym selff. Be consideracion wher off \u00feer olde maistirs shall be bettir serued be thaym than thei were be fore; and so be more myghty in thair contraes to do what them liste; and the kynge in lasse myght, and haue the ffewer officers to represse hem when thai do a mysse. And this hath causyd mony men to be suche braggers and suytours \n  to \u00fee kyng, ffor to haue his offices in \u00feer contraes to thaym selff, and to \u00feer men, \u00feat almost no man in sume contray durste take an office off \u00fee kyng, but he ffirst had \u00fee good will off \u00fee said bragers and engrossers of offices. Ffor yff he dyd not so, he shuld not aftir \u00feat tyme haue pease in his contray; wheroff hath comyn and growen mony gret trowbels and debates in dyuerse contraes off Englond. Wich materes thrugly considered, it semyth verely good, \u00feat no man haue any office of \u00fee kynges yefte, but he be ffirst sworne that he is seruant to non o\u00feer man, or woll serue any o\u00feer man, or take is clothynge or ffee while he seruyth \u00fee kyng. And \u00feat no man haue mo offices then on, except \u00feat the kynges bretheryn mowe haue ij offices; and suche men as serue \u00fee kyng abouute his person, or in his counsell, mowe haue in \u00feer contrays a parkershippe ffor \u00feer disporte when thay come whom, or such an o\u00feer office, as thai mey wele kepe by \u00feer deputes.", "17": "CHAPTER XVIII.

This maner off ffundacion mey not be ayenste \u00fee kynges prerogatyff, or his liberte, no more than is \u00fee ffundacion off an abbey, ffro wich he mey take no parte off \u00fee possescions wich he hath onis geve hym, with owt \u00fee assent off \u00feer covent.
