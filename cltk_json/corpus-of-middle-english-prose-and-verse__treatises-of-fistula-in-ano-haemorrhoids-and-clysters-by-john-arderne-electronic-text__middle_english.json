[I, I]ohn Arderne fro the first pestilence that was in the &yogh;ere of oure lord 1349 duellid in Newerk in Notyngham-shire vnto the &yogh;ere of oure lord 1370, and ther I helid many men of fistula in ano.  Of whiche the first was Sire Adam Eueryngham of laxton-in-the-clay byside Tukkesford; whiche Sire Adam, forsoth, was in Gascone with sir Henry, that tyme named Erle of derby and aftir was made duke of lancastre, a noble and worthi lord.  The forsaid sir Adam, forsoth, suffrand fistulam in ano, made for to aske counsel at a&llbar; the leche&yogh; and cirurgien&yogh; that he my&yogh;t fynde in Gascone, at Burdeux, at Briggerac, Tolows, and Neyrbon, and Peyters, and many other places.  And all forsoke hym for vncurable; whiche y-se and y-herde, \u00fee forseid Adam hastied for to torne hom to his contre.  And when he come home, he did of al his kny&yogh;tly clothinges and cladde mornyng clothes, in purpose of abydyng dissoluyng, or lesyng, of his body beyng ni&yogh; to hym.  At last I, forseid Io&hbar;n Arderne, y-sou&yogh;t and couenant y-made, come to hym and did my cure to hym and, oure lord beyng mene, Domino mediate. I helid hym perfitely within half a &yogh;ere; and aftirward, hole and sounde, he ledde a glad lif by 30 &yogh;ere and more, ffor whiche cure I gatte myche honour and louyng \u00feur&yogh; al ynglond.  And the forseid duke of lancastre and many othir gentile&yogh; wondred ther-of.  Aftirward I cured hugon derlyng of ffowick of Balne by Snay\u00fee. Aftirward I  cured Io&hbar;n Schefeld of Bri&yogh;twell a-side Tekyll. Aftirward I cured sir Reynald Grey, lord of Wilton in Wale&yogh; and lord of Schirlond biside Chesterfelde, whiche asked counsel at the most famose leches of yngland, and none availed hym.  Aftirward I cured sir Henry Blakborne, clerk, Tresorer of the lord Prince of Wale&yogh;.  Aftirward I cured Adam Oumfray of Shelforde byside Notyngham, and sir Io&hbar;n, preste of the same toune; and Io&hbar;n of holle of Shirlande; and Sir Thomas hamelden, parsone of langare in the Vale of Beuare. Aftirward I curid frere Thomas Gunny, custode of the frere Mynours of &yogh;orke. Aftirward, in the &yogh;ere of oure lord 1370, I come to. london, and ther I cured Io&hbar;n Colyn, Mair of Northampto&ntail;, that asked counsel at many leche&yogh;.  Aftirward I helid or cured Hew Denny, ffisshmanger of londo&ntail;, in Briggestrete; and William Polle, and Raufe Double; and oon that was called Thomas Broune, that had 15 holes by whiche went out wynde with egestious odour; that is to sey, 8 hole&yogh; of the to[ne] party of the ersse, and 7 on the tothir side; Of whiche some hole&yogh; was distant fro the towell by the space of the handbrede of a man, so that bothe his buttokis was so vlcerat and putrefied with-in that the quitour and filthe went out ich \n day als mych as an egg-shel mi&yogh;t take.  Afterward I cured 4 frere&yogh; prechours, that is to sey ffrere Io&hbar;n Writell, ffrere Io&hbar;n haket, ffrere Petre Browne, ffrere Thomas Apperley, and a &yogh;ong man called Thomas Voke.  Of whiche forseid som had only on hol y-distaunte fro the towel by oon ynche, or by two, or by thre.  And other[s] had 4 or 5 hole&yogh; procedyng to the codde of the testicle&yogh;; And many other maners of whiche the tellyng war ful hard.  All thise forseid cured I afore the makyng of this boke.  Oure lord Ihesu y-blessid God knoweth that I lye not, and therfore no man dout of this, \u00feof-al old famous men and ful clere in studie haue confessed tham that thei fande nat the wey of curacio&ntail; in this case. ffor god, that is deler or rewarder of wisdom, hath hid many thingis fro wise men and sli&yogh;e whiche he vouchesaf aftirward for to shewe to symple men.  Therfore al men \u00feat ar to come aftirward witte thai that old maistre&yogh; war no&yogh;t  bisie ne pertinace&yogh; in sekyng and serchyng of this forseid cure.  But for thai mi&yogh;t no&yogh;t take the hardnes of it at the first frount, thei kest it vtterly byhinde \u00feair bak.  Of whiche, forso\u00fe, som demed it holy for to be incurable; o\u00feer applied doutful opinions.  Therfore for-als-miche in hard thingis it spedith to studiers for to perseuere and abide, and for to turne subtily thair wittes. ffor it is opned not to \u00feam that ar passand but to tham \u00feat ar perseuerand. non transeuntibus sed perseverantibus pulsantibus aperitur. Therfore to the honour of god almy&yogh;ti that hath opned witte to me that I shuld fynde tresour hidde in the felde of studiers that long tyme and [with] pantyng breest I haue swette and trauailed ful bisily and pertinacely in diuanudiis. \" diu avidius \" says the best Latin text. As my faculte suffice\u00fe without fair spekyng of endityng, I haue brou&yogh;t for to shew it openly to tham that cometh aftur, our lord beyng me[ne] and this boke. No&yogh;t that I shewe myself more worthi of louyng of suche a gifte than other, but that I greue not god, and for the dragme that he hath giffen to me that I be not constreyned for treson.  Therfore I pray that the grace of the holy gost be to this werke, that he vouch-saf for to spede it; that tho thingis whiche in wrokyng trewly I am ofte tymes experte, I may plenerly explane tham in this litel boke. And this I sey that I know no&yogh;t in al my tyme, ne hard not in al my tyme, of any man, nou\u00feer in yngland ne in partie&yogh; bi&yogh;ond \u00fee see, that kouthe cure fistula in ano; outake a frere minour that was with the prince of Wale&yogh; in gascon & gyan, whiche rosed & bosted hym that he had cured the forseid sekenes. And at london he deceyued many men; and when he mi&yogh;t no&yogh;t cure som man, he made suggestion to tham that no man mi&yogh;t cure tham, and that affermed he with sweryng that &yogh;if the fistule war dried, that the pacient at the next shuld no&yogh;t eschape dethe; whiche, forso\u00fee, y-lefte & forsake of hym I cured perfitely. And to remoue false opinions of ignorant men, for witnes I putte experience.  Auicen, forso\u00fe, sei\u00fe, 'experience ouercome\u00fe reson'; and galien in pantegni sei\u00fe, 'No man ow for to trust in reson al-oon but &yogh;it it be proued of experience.'  And he seith  \nin ano\u00feer place, 'Experience without reson is feble, & so is reson withoute experience fest vnto hym.'  Ne\u00feerlesse I afferme no&yogh;t that I mi&yogh;t hele al ffistulae in ano. ffor som ben vncurable as it shal be seid [more fully] \" Plenius \" says the Latin text. within when I shal trete of tham. ffirst it bihoueth hym that wil profite in this crafte that he sette god afore euermore in all his werkis, and euermore calle mekely with hert and mouth his help; and som tyme visite of his wynnyngis poure men aftir his my&yogh;t, that thai by thair prayers may gete hym grace of the holy goste.  And that he be no&yogh;t y-founden temerarie or bosteful in his seyingis or in his dedes; and abstene he hym fro moche speche, and most among grete men; and answere he slei&yogh;ly to thingis y-asked, that he be no&yogh;t y-take in his wordes.  fforsoth &yogh;if his werkes be oft tyme knowen for to discorde fro his wordes and his byhestis, he shal be halden more vnworthi, and he shal blemmyssh his oone gode fame.  Wherfore sei\u00fe a versifiour, ' vincat opus verbum, minuit iactantia famam '; 'lat werke ouercome thi worde, for boste lessene\u00fe gode lose.'  Also be a leche no&yogh;t mich laughyng ne mich playing.  And als moche as he may withoute harme fle he \u00fee felawshippe of knafes and of vnu[n]este persones.  And be he euermore occupied in thingis that biholdith to his crafte; outhir rede he, or studie he, or write or pray he; for the excercyse of bokes worshippe\u00fe a leche.  ffor why ; he shal bo\u00fe byholden and he shal be more wise.  And aboue al \u00feise it profiteth to hym that he be founden euermore sobre; ffor dronkenne&yogh; destroyeth al vertu and bringith it to not, as seith a wise man, ' Ebrietas frangit quicquid sapiencia tangit ': 'Dronkenes breketh what-so wisdom toucheth.'  Be he content in strange places of metes and drinkes \u00feer y-founden, vsyng mesure in al thingis.  ffor the wise man seith, ' Sicut ad omne quod est mensuram ponere prodest, Sic sine mensura deperit omne quod est ': 'As it profiteth to putte mesure to al thing that is, So without mesure perisshe\u00fe all \u00feing \u00feat is.'  Skorne he no man.  ffor of that it is seid, ' Deridens alios non inderisus abibit ': 'He that skorne\u00fe other men shal not go away vnskorned.' &yogh;if ther be made speche to hym of any leche, nouther sette he hym at nou&yogh;t ne preise hym to mich or commende hym, but thus may he curteysly answere; 'I haue \n\n no&yogh;t vrey knowleche of hym, \" non habeo de eo veram notitiam \" says the Latin version. but I lerned no&yogh;t ne I haue not herd of hym but gode and honeste.'  And of this shal honour and thankyngis of eche party encresse and multiplie to hym; aftur this, honour is in the honorant & no&yogh;t in the honored.  Considere he no&yogh;t ouer openly the lady or the dou&yogh;ters or o\u00feer fair wymmen in gret mennes in domibus magnatum. [houses] ne profre tham no&yogh;t to kisse, ne touche not priuely ne apertely thair pappes, ne thair handes, ne thair share, aut pubem. that he renne no&yogh;t into the indignacion of the lord ne of noon of his.  In as moche as he may, greue he no seruant, but gete he thair loue and thair gode wille.  \nAbstene he hym fro harlotrie als wele in wordes as in dedes in euery place, for &yogh;if he vse hym to harlotery in priue places som tyme in opene place ther may falle to hym vnworship of yuel vsage; aftir \u00feat it is seyde, 'Pede super colles pedes vbi pedere nolles.'  'ffart vpon hille&yogh; and thou shalt fart whar thou wolde no&yogh;t agayn thi wille&yogh;.'  And it is seid in ano\u00feer place, 'Shrewed speche colloquia mala. corrumpith gode maners.'  When seke men, forsoth, or any of tham bysyde come\u00fe to the leche to aske help or counsel of hym, be he no&yogh;t to tham ouer felle ne ouer homely, but mene in beryng aftir the askyngis of the persone&yogh; nimis severus nec nimis familiaris sed in gestu mediocris secundum exigentiam personarum. ; to som reuerently, to som comonly.  ffor after wise men, Ouer moche homelynes brede\u00fe dispisyng. Also it spede\u00fe \u00feat he haue semyng excusacions that he may not incline to \u00feair askyngis, without harmyng or without indignacion of som gret man or frende, or for necessarie occupacion.  Or feyne he hym hurt, or for to be seke, or som other couenable cause by whiche he may likely be excused.  Therfor, &yogh;if he will fauoure to any mannes askyng, make he couenant for his trauaile, and take it byforehande&yogh;.  But avise \u00fee leche hym-self wele that he giffe no certayn answer in any cause, but he se first \u00fee sikenes and the maner of it; and whan he ha\u00fe seen and assaied it, \u00feof-al hym seme that the seke may be heled, ne\u00feerlesse he shal make pronosticacion to \u00fee pacient \u00fee perile&yogh; to come &yogh;if the cure be differred.  And &yogh;if he se \u00fee pacient persewe bisily the cure, et si viderit patientem attentius curam prosequi. \u00fean after that \u00fee state of \u00fee pacient aske\u00fe aske he boldly more or lesse; but euer be he warre of scarse askyngis, ffor  ouer scarse askyngis sette\u00fe at not both \u00fee markette and the thing.  Therfore for the cure of fistula in ano, when it is curable, aske he competently, of a worthi man and a gret an hundred marke or fourty pounde, wi\u00fe robe&yogh; and fee&yogh; cum robis et feodis . of an hundred shillyng terme of lyfe by &yogh;ere .  Of lesse men fourty pounde, or fourty marke aske he without fee&yogh;; And take he no&yogh;t lesse \u00fean an hundred shillyngis.  ffor neuer in all my lyf toke I lesse than an hundred shillyng for cure of that sekenes.  Ne\u00feerlesse do another man as hym \u00feink better and more spedefulle.  And &yogh;if the pacientes or thair frende&yogh; or seruaunt&yogh; aske by how moche tyme he hopeth to hele it, euermore lat the leche byhete \u00fee double \u00feat he supposeth to spede by half; that is &yogh;if the leche hope to hele \u00fee pacient by twenty wekes\u2014that is the comon course of curyng\u2014adde he so many ouer.  ffor it is better that the terme be lengthed \u00fean the cure.  ffor prolongacion of the cure giffe\u00fe cause of dispairyng to the paciente&yogh; when triste to the leche is moste hope of helthe.  And &yogh;if the pacient considere or wondre or aske why that he putte hym so long a tyme of curyng, si\u00fee \u00feat he heled hym by the half, answere he that it was for that the pacient was strong-herted, and suffrid wele sharp \u00feingis, and that he was of gode complexion and hadde able flesshe to hele; & feyne he othir causes pleseable to the pacient, ffor paciente&yogh; of syche worde&yogh; are proude and delited.  Also dispose a leche hym that in clothes and othir apparalyngis be he honeste, no&yogh;t likkenyng hymself in apparalyng or berying to mynistralle&yogh;, but in clothing and beryng shew he the maner of clerkes.  ffor why; it semeth any discrete man y-cladde with clerkis clothing for to occupie gentil menne&yogh; borde&yogh;. \u00b6 Haue the leche also clene handes and wele shapen naile&yogh; & clensed fro all blaknes and filthe. And be he curtaise at lorde&yogh; borde&yogh;, and displese he no&yogh;t in wordes or dedes to the gestes syttyng by; here he many \u00feingis but speke he but fewe. \u00b6 For a wise man seith, 'It semeth more to vse the eres than \u00fee tunge'; And in an-o\u00feer place, '&yogh;if thou had bene stille thou had bene holden a philosophre.'  And whan he shal speke, be the worde&yogh; short, and, als mich as he may, faire and resonable \n\n and withoute sweryng. \u00b6 Be war that ther be neuer founden double worde dupliciter sermo. in his mouthe, ffor &yogh;if he be founden trew in his wordes ffewe or noon shal doute in his dede&yogh;.  Lere also a &yogh;ong leche gode prouerbe&yogh; pertenyng to his crafte in counfortyng of paciente&yogh;. \u00b6 Or &yogh;if pacientes pleyne that ther medicynes bene bitter or sharp or sich other, than shal the leche sey to the pacient thus; \"It is redde in the last lesson of matyns of the natiuit\u00e8 of oure lord that oure lorde Ihesus criste come into this world for the helthe of mannes kynd to the maner of a gode leche and wise.  And when he cometh to the seke man he sheweth hym medicynes, som li&yogh;t and som hard; and he sei\u00fe to the seke man, '&yogh;if \u00feou wilt be made hole \u00feise and \u00feise shal thou tak.' \u00b6 Also in another place in an omely vpon the gospel of the sone&yogh; of Zebedee, wher \u00feer moder askid seying, 'lord, sey \u00feat my two sones sitte in thy kyngdome, \u00fee tone on \u00fei ri&yogh;t hand and the to\u00feer on the left.'  And Ihesus answeryng seide, '&yogh;e wote neuer what &yogh;e aske'; \u00fean seid he to the sone&yogh; of Zebedee, 'May &yogh;e drink \u00fee chalice \u00feat I am to drink?' \u00deai seid to him, 'We may'; as &yogh;if he seid to \u00feam, '&yogh;if &yogh;oure soule or mynd couaite \u00feat delite\u00fe, drinke \u00fee first \u00feat sorowe\u00fe or ake\u00fe.'  And so by bitter drinkis of confeccion it is come to the ioyes of hel\u00fee.\" Si mens vestra appetat quod demulcat, prius bibite quod dolet et sic per amarum poculum confectionis pervenitur ad gaudia salutis. Ouer that hym ow to comforte \u00fee pacient in monysshyng hym that in anguisshe&yogh; he be of gret hert.  ffor gret hert make\u00fe a man hardy and strong to suffre sharp \u00feingis and greuous: And it is a gret vertue and an happy, ffor Boecius sei\u00fe, De disciplina scolarium, 'He is no&yogh;t wor\u00fei of \u00fee poynt of swetnes that kan no&yogh;t be lymed with greuyng of bitternes.  ffor why; a strong medicyne answerith to a strong sekenes.'  And \u00feeron sei\u00fe a wise man,  'Be no cure sene heuy or greuous to the to whiche folowe\u00fe ane heleful effecte.' \u00b6 And in ano\u00feer place it is seid, 'happy or blessid be \u00feat day \u00feat ordeyne\u00fe mery &yogh;eres.' And ano\u00feer seith, 'he may neuer be in reste of body \u00feat is oute of reste of soule; I wil suffre lesse \u00feingis \u00feat I suffre no&yogh;t more greuous.'  It seme\u00fe a gret herted man for to suffre sharp \u00feingis; he, forso\u00fe, \u00feat is wayke of hert is no&yogh;t in way of curacion, ffor why; for so\u00fee in al  my lyf I haue sene but fewe laborante in \u00feis vice heled in any sikenes: \u00feerfore it is to be-war to wise men \u00feat \u00feei entremette no&yogh;t with sich.  ffor whi; \u00dee wise man sei\u00fe, 'All \u00feinges ar hard to a waik hert man, for \u00feai trow euermore yuelle&yogh; to be ny&yogh;e to \u00feam; \u00feei drede euermore, \u00feai suffre no \u00feingis, \u00feai are euermore vnstable and vnwise; \u00feerfore a versifiour sei\u00fe of tham, ' Quominus Quamvis . nil pacior paciendi me tenet horror ': \u00feat is \u00feof-al I suffre no-\u00feing, vgglynes of suffryng holdeth me. \u00b6 Also it spedeth \u00feat a leche kunne talke of gode tale&yogh; and of honest that may make \u00fee pacientes to laugh, as wele of the biblee as of other tragedie&yogh;; & any othir \u00feingis of which it is no&yogh;t to charge while&yogh; \u00feat \u00feey make or induce a li&yogh;t hert to \u00fee pacient or \u00fee sike man. \u00b6 Discouer neuer the leche vnwarly the counselle&yogh; of his paciente&yogh;, als wele of men as of wymmen, ne MS. \u00fee. sette no&yogh;t oon to ano\u00feer at no&yogh;t, \u00feof-al he haue cause, \u00feat he be no&yogh;t gilty of counsell; ffor &yogh;if a man se \u00fee hele wele ano\u00feer mannes counsel he wil trist better in \u00fee.

Aftur al \u00feise it houeth that he knowe \u00fee names of \u00fee instrumentis \u00feat perteneth to \u00fee cure of \u00fee fistule, withoute whiche a leche may no&yogh;t wele spede hym.

If any one wishes to know and to discover in which sign of the heaven the moon is on any day, he must first discover in the almanac the sign in which the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun and the day of the conjunction.  When this is found you know the first day of the moon because it is from that hour of the day or night when the conjunction occurs to the same hour of the next day.  Then calculate by the almanac the number of days from the new moon thus obtained to the day you want.  Look next in the previous table where the number is found, and when it is found look in the upper line of the table for the sign in which the moon is.  Coming straight down from this you cross until you come directly to the sign corresponding lineally with the number of the age of the moon, and this gives the sign of the moon on that day.  And note that in this calculation the natural day begins at midday according to the Astronomers.  If any one wishes therefore to be sure of the time let him learn and understand the following table of the 12 signs.  It begins thus\u2014Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, &c. [The Table given on pages 18, 19 follows here in Latin Text.] The highest Astrologers, viz.: Ptolomy, Pythagoras, Rhasis, Haly, &c., aver that a surgeon ought not to cut or to cauterise any member of the human body nor to breathe a vein so long as the moon is in the house ruling that member.  For the 12 signs of the Zodiac rule the twelve parts of the human body, as is clear from the aforementioned drawing, where Aries, which is a fiery sign moderately dry, governs the head with its contents.  But when the moon is in Aries beware of operating upon the head or face and do not open one of the head veins.  When the moon is in Taurus refrain from operating upon the neck or throat and do not bleed from a vein in these parts.  When the moon is in Gemini beware of operating on the shoulders, arms or hands, and do not [Table for finding the Moon's house.] open a vein in these parts.  When the moon is in Cancer refrain from operating upon the breasts or chest or stomach and from injuring the lungs, neither open an artery or a vein in their neighbourhood. When the moon is in Leo take care not to injure the flanks or the ribs, and do not operate upon the back either by cutting or by cupping.  When the moon is in Virgo take care not to operate upon the belly or the internal parts, and do not bleed from the veins supplying the womb in women.  When the moon is in Libra refrain from operating upon the navel or upon the buttocks or upon the kidneys, and do not open the vein supplying the kidneys, nor apply a cup.  When the moon is in Scorpio refrain from operating upon the testicles, the penis and the neck of the bladder; do not open the testicular vein and do not apply a cup.  When the moon is in Sagittarius do not operate upon the thighs, do not remove spots or superfluous parts occurring in any part of the human body.  When the moon is in Capricornus refrain from the knees and from injuring the veins and nerves in these parts.  When the moon is in Aquarius do not operate upon the legs or upon their nerves from the knees to the bottom of the calves.  When the moon is in Pisces do not operate upon the feet and do not open the vein in their extremities.", "2": {"0": "[3.] Of diffinicion of a fistule, and places \u00feat it is bred in, and when it is curable or no&yogh;t.", "1": "[N]ow it is to procede to \u00fee curyng of \u00fee fistule.

Quia in collo est origo omnium morborum.  Et spasmus est contractio musculorum ad suas origines.  Istud carmen sequens contra spasmum expertissimum est a multis inventis eo utentibus, tam in partibus transmarinis quam in istis.

Because the source of all diseases is in the neck: And spasm is a contraction of the muscles at their origin.  The following charm against spasm has been found most sovran by many who have used it both at home and abroad.  For amongst the Mediolani [i.e.] the Milanese, in Lombardy at the time when the Lord Lionel, son of the king of England, married the daughter of the lord of Milan, the English there were troubled with spasm due to their potations of the strong & hot wines of the country & to too many carouses.  Whereupon a certain knight, the son of Lord Reginald de Grey de Schirlond near Chesterfield, who was at Milan with the Lord Lionel & had with him the following charm, & saw a certain gentleman so troubled with the spasm that his head was drawn backward nearly to his neck just like a crossbow, & he was almost dead from the pain and starvation.  And when the said knight saw this he brought the charm written on parchment & placed it in a purse & put it upon the neck of the patient whilst those who stood by said the Lord's prayer and one to our lady Mary, and, as he swore faithfully to me, within four hours or five he was restored to health.  And afterwards he freed many there from spasm, & the great report of that charm spread throughout that state.

And if any one carries that charm written fairly in the name of God almighty, & believes, without doubt he will not be troubled with cramp.  Let it be held in respect on account of the Lord who gave virtue to words, to stones & to herbs, & let it be made secretly that every one should not know the charm lest perchance it should lose the virtues given by God."}}}, "sourceLink": "http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/browse.html", "fname": "./sgml/ArderneFistula.sgm", "originalTitle": "Treatises of fistula in ano : haemorrhoids, and clysters / by John Arderne [electronic text]", "language": "middle_english", "author": "Arderne, John, fl. 1307-1370", "source": "Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse"}
