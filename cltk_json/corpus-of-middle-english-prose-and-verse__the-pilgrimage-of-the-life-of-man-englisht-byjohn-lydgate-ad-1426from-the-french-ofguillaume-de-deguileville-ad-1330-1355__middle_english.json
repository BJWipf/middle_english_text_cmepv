Ex maria , ergo, pium Pacis traxit commercium, Noua reparans federa, Et reddens Arbitragium Se Sed, Pr. ad patris arbitrium Obtulit, propter scelera, Mundi beata viscera Huius matris, et vbera, Suum-que puerperium. Felix ipsa puerpera, Seruiant ei sydera, Et totus grex fidelium. Virgine ipsa firmiter Seruante, et Seruantque, Pr. stabiliter Sancti pudoris lilium filium, Pr. Suum, Venus et Iupiter, Et totum celum pariter Mirantur puerperium, Etas quoque viuencium, Et Iuuentus & senium, De hoc stupent perhenniter. 'Miror,' dicit, 'ingenium, Et virginem et filium Hic studerem inaniter.' Passus est ipse filius, Licet peccati nescius, Penas & contumelias, Factus-que est propicius, Qui ferus fuerat prius. Iam expertus miserias, Nunquam inuentus alias, Fuit pater-familias, Qui contulerit plenius Suas misericordias Pro suis, & angustias Sustinuerit durius. Sub, qui supra est, ponitur, Et subdito subicitur, subijcitur, Pr. Rex celorum altissimus Coram iudice ducitur, Et iudicio sistitur, Qui Iudex est equissimus, Superior sit infimus, Et virorum nouissimus, A suis-que relinquitur, De maximo fit minimus, Et licet sit sanctissimus, Reus mortis condicitur; Poncio Pilato, Feram, Ferente et mortiferam Contra ipsum sentenciam. In cruce manum dexteram Affigendam, et alteram Extendit in angariam; Tunc secundum Ieremiam Hieruniam. Pr. Transeuntibus per viam, Potuit suam asperam Monstrare contumeliam, Illatam per inuidiam, Cum nil egisset perperam. Crucifixus ille fuit, Et soluit quod non rapuit, Dans animam in precium. Sua pena non latuit, Sanguis fluens edocuit, Et latus suum peruium, Anime-que diuorcium. Quantum graue supplicium Pro homine sustinuit! Suum quoque obprobrium Factum oculis omnium, Euidenter hoc innuit. Mortuus est, eum tradidit Deo patri, et reddidit, Fuso sanguine, spiritum. Moriens, artem condidit, Qua sibi mortem subdidit, Sibi tollens ius solitum, Hostis per hanc depositum Quod tenebat ad libitum. Confusus totum perdidit, Infernus-que dans gemitum, Videns suorum exitum, Sibi dolorem addidit. Et ideo dum moritur, Et dum per hoc reuiuitur, Fletus miscetur gaudio, Pro morte fletus oritur, Cum innocens occiditur, Pro alieno vicio. Fit autem exultacio, Cum mentali tripudio, Dum per mortem mors vincitur Pio tamen arbitrio Videtur-que compassio Satis in plus intenditur. Sepultus est per triduum, Vsu sopito sensuum, Sicut mortui seculi, Suum erat irriguum, Exhaustum atque arcuum; Exhausti omnes riuuli, Deleti erant tituli Visu wlgaris vulgaris, Pr. oculi. Vincisse fuisse suum, Fuisse caput Anguli, Ductor uel rector populi, Aut deus exercituum. Descendit eius anima, Corporis sancta victima, Relicta in sudario, Ad acherontis infima Venit pro dragina decima, Longo perdita senio, Non illa que de gaudio Lapsa est a principio Ad inferni nouissima. Sed illa procul dubio, Que, in primo pomerio, Rapta est fraude pessima. Ad inferna, cum lumine Veniens, & in numine, Genus Adam visitauit, A baratri voragine, Desentos ? Descensos. in caligine, Suos omnes liberauit, Ille hostem tunc mactauit, Et mactatum spoliauit Sua consuetudine. Ne furiat in quos pauit Sicut prius, et quos lauit, Fuso corporis sanguine. Tercia die redijt, Et tempus non preterijt, Datum ante diuorcium. Regrediens, introijt Potenter vnde exijt Corporis domicilium, Lapis magnus ad hostium ostium . . . ostiarium, Pr, Datus in hostiarium ostium . . . ostiarium, Pr, Hunc ingressum non Egressum suum, Pr. nescijt, Custodum-que astancium Sellercia Sollentia, Pr. et studium Percipere non nequijt. Resurrexit a mortuis, Resumptis viribus suis, Vltra morti non subditus, Clausis venis irriguis Et tersis plagis profluis, Impassibilis penitus, Vita sibi est habitus, Priuacio interitus, Realteratis mutuis. Thome testis est digitus, Vulneribus appositus, Ex iussu, clausis Ianuis. Ascendit supra sydera, Et supra celi supera, Rediens de incolatu, Transeundo per aera, Findens redemptis ethera Potentyssimo volatu. Tunc Rachel, cum apparatu On margin : Rachel interpretata, vidua domini, & signat cecum . . qui in morte [? MS.] slantes dicit ysaias [xxxiii. 7] 'Angeli pacis a[mare] flebunt.' In assensu eius [?

Ad celos, sic quando fuit Regressus, et rehabuit Honoris primi solium, Quando vnitam statuit, Carnem nostram et posuit, Caput esse celestium; Tunc homo in exilium Datus, & in obprobrium, Luctum tergere debuit, Et relevare cilium Demissum propter vicium, Regraciando potuit. Sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris , cocqualis ei, Hominem sic magnificans, Tempus sui Iubilei Cognoscens, et requiei. Plus se penis non implicans, Modus suus est indicans Quod Iam iudex sit iudicans, Ne presumant nimis rei. Quodque Neque, Pr. deuotus supplicans, Cicius-que ius vindicans. vendicans, Pr.

Omnipotentis filium Potencie non nescium, Hunc anima mea credit; Et si quid est contrarium Potencie vel obuium, Huic inesse non concedit, Imbecillis si accedit, Ad eum nunquam recedit, Non reportans auxilium. Totum posse suo cedit. Deus pater, sibi dedit Regni celi dominium. Inde venturus, In fine, Cum ferula discipline Et vlcionis gladio, Eductis tecto vagine Pro iusticie diuine Exercendo iudicio.

Credo, cum precedentibus, Et cum predictis omnibus, Quosdam adhuc articulos, Quos in mundi campestribus Totis anime viribus Colligo ut manipulos, Fidei namque flosculos, Hos sicut et preambulos, Cognosco ex coloribus, Ad ipsos habens oculos, Vt discurram per singulos, Non exceptis aliquibus. In spiritum sanctum credo, Licet fex sim, et putredo, Et vilis esca vermium. Ipse patris est dulcedo, Est filij, & atque, Pr. mulcedo; Et consolator cordium, Dicere potest omnium. Artifex sum per et, Pr. proprium, Patre nato-que procedo; Digitus sum errancium, Tercia persona trium, Procedens, nunquam recedo. Sanctam ecclesiam dei Credo esse matrem mei, Cunctorum-que fidelium. Qui contrariantur ei, Facti sunt omnino rei; Erit eis opprobrium.

Pater, creator omnium, donans cuncta per filium, accepta nostros genitus per dona sancti spiritus O unitatis trinitas et trinitatis unitas! pro tuo sancto nomine, emunda nos a crimine! Mundatos a criminibus, dona virtutum floribus, et in polorum sedibus fac jungi cum fidelibus. Sit laus patri per s\u00e6cula, agnoque sine macula, atque sancto spiritui, quo mereamur perfrui. Amen!

Origo et principium A quo causantur omnia, Ad te, tuarum ouium, Tuorum grex fidelium, Alta mittit suspiria, In fletu et miseria, Captiuati per deuia, Non habemus remedium, Nisi tua clemencia, Tua paterna gracia Nobis ferat auxilium. A Gap for the first word of every stanza was left blank for the Rubricator to fill in; but he hasnt fild it. I therefore insert the words from the old printed book, ab. 1500. Noster voluisti esse, Ne nobis esset neccesse, Extra te quicquam querere Non poteras plus prodesse, Neque de maiori messe Nobis vnquam tribuere; Solus debes sufficere, Quia solus reficere Potes mentes plebis fesse, Aliud quam te temere; Auernus nam deficere Restat, si velis abesse. Qvies Fuisti, et eris; Pater, succurre miseris, Qui non manemus in idem, Idem ipse tu diceris, Qui nunquam permutaberis, Manens semper in ibidem, id idem. Sicut hoc credimus quidem, Fac, pater, per istam fidem, Vt noxas nostri sceleris, Dimittas nobis totidem, Quotiens promisit pridem, Redemptor nostri generis. In celis sursum habitas, Qui in terris nos visitas, Dominus exercituum, Si non feris aut excitas, Nos remissos non suscitas Ad ullum opus strenuum, Ad volandum in arduum, Et altam messem fructuum, Alas habens irritas, Laboramus in vacuum, Nec habemus irriguum, Nisi tua det bonitas.

Tuum pater est proprium, Non annexum per alium, Misereri et parcere De te, suum tentorium Et suum diuersorium, Debent filij facere Mortem non vis, sed viuere, Vis omnes qui conuertere Se volunt per suspirium. Nunquam uis tuos perdere, Nec pullos milus tradere, Quorum tu es refugium. Adueniat ergo deus, Aliquando iubileus, Nobis datis exilio, Si quisquam nostrum est reus, Nec est ibi Machabeus, Qui fortis sit in prelio, Non propter hoc intencio Tua sit ut nos gladio, Vastet, Golyath, Getheus, Etheus, Pr.

Sicut, pater, hoc credimus, Sicut de hoc confidimus, Sic nobis auxiliaris, Aliunde non querimus Auxilium, nec petimus, Quia solus tu mederis, Si non aliquando feris Pro nostris culpis et teris.

Et ideo requirimus, Et devote assistimus Ante tuum sanctum thronum; Vt nobis, qui peccauimus, Sis, vt de te presumimus, Memor miseracionum. Panem nostrum In sudore Vescendum, et in labore, Dedisti a principio, Vsque modo tali more Ipso mixto cum merore, tali more, Pr. Nostra fuit refectio; Sed, ne esset fastidio, Prouidisti de alio, Longe satis meliore; Hoc est, de tuo filio, In quem panis conuersio Fit, ipso institutore. Quotidianum petimus Hunc panem, et requirimus, Cotidie indigentes, Primum exactor proximus Secundum petit animus; Sine ipso morientes, Primo uiuunt omnes gentes, Sed secundo penitentes Quia panis est azimus, Ideo, accipientes Omni fermento carentes, Debent esse, Esse debent, Pr. vt credimus. Da panem istum, domine, Vtrumque qui pro homine, Vtroque fuit pensatus, [111/2] Sustentet moderamine, Vnus vnum, sed minime Fiet alter saciatus, Si in nobis sit reatus, [?

Et quia digne lugere Non possumus, neque flere, Si exigunt demerita, Nec habemus quo supplere Nisi solum miserere, Quia non valent merita, Nostra quoque sunt irrita [111/3] Anima nostra perdita; Ideo clamamus vere, [?

Lamentari nos fac fac nos, Pr. ita Ne scribantur perpetuo. Non sunt vnum, non sunt duo, Nec numeranda biduo; triduo, Pr. Sed sunt quasi infinita, Non habita ex mutuo, Neque facta in triduo, Sed in tota nostra vita. vita nostra, Pr. Debita ipsa nouimus, Nam pro peccatis tradimus dedimus, Pr. Animas in obsidium. Penes nos non habuimus, Nec in domo inuenimus Vllum carius vadium. Deus, nostrum refugium, Tu, nosti vsurarium, Cui nos obligauimus, Nisi feras auxilium, Vel eum cogas nimium, Totum nostrum amisimus. Nostra esse hec debita Propter que sic est subdita Anima vsurario, Non negamus, ne irrita, Et tibi ingratuita Esset illa negacio. Talis tamen confessio Nunquam dicit sufficio, Neque tibi sit placita Nisi feruens deuocio Et amara contricio Dicat fleo deperdita. Sicut ergo debitores Et miseri peccatores, Egemus indulgencia; Sic quoque condonatores Rancoris, et quittatores, Volumus vti venia; In tua namque curia, Rancor et iracundia Non sunt boni petitores. Nam vindicte pro gracia Et pro misericordia Noscuntur reportatores. Et Ideo indulgemus Iniurias, vt vellemus Eas nobis indulgeri. Nil rancoris retinemus In cordibus, nec habemus Quod non sit amoris veri. Si fuimus nimis feri, Et ad indulgendum seri, Et vltores si possemus, Nostri velis misereri, Et cordibus sic mederi, Vt in charitate stemus. Nos scimus quod non aliter taliter, Pr. Nostre preces vtiliter Ascendunt ad te, domine. Credimus quoque firmiter Quod ascendunt velociter Si sint sine rubigine, Si lacrimarum flumine, Corda cum penitudine Lauentur efficaciter, Et munda mens a crimine, Vt vis valet in homine, Te requirat humiliter. Dimittimus, si corditus Cunctis dicamus penitus, Hoc totum ualet supplere, Si spiritus paraclitus, Dextere tue digitus, [? MS.] Ad hoc velit nos docere. Sine ipso, nunquam vere Iniurias indulgere Potest arrogans spiritus; Nam nimis credens valere, Admodum cornute fere, Monstrat quod sit indomitus. Debitoribus ideo, Quandoque nimis ferreo Corde, dat indulgenciam, Dicens, satis indulgeo, Et satis supersedeo, Vsque in horam aliam; Sed tu hanc hanc tu, Pr. fraudulentiam Deus nunquam ad veniam Conuertis vel das pro eo. Immo, ad iracundiam, Te, per equipollenciam, Prouocatum, reddis reo. Nostris igitur mentibus, Induratis et rudibus, Tria sunt necessaria, De commissis reatibus, Atque iniquitatibus Crebra reminiscencia; Frequenter pati tristia, Cum pena et angaria angustia, Pr. Et cum infirmitatibus, Sancti spiritus gracia, De cella vnguentaria Fundens amorem cordibus. Et ideo, te et illum Qui rubricatum vexillum Gerit, et arma rubea, Qui mare facit tranquillum, Et nostrum portat sigillum Exaratum a lancea, [? MS.] Qui veste rectus lutea Strauit in sua area Infernalem cocodrillum Petimus, vt sic ferrea Corda franguntur per ea Que sunt pretacta paxillum, pauxillum, Pr.

This French edition was 'corrected' by a Monk of DeGuilleville's monastery, and was printed in or about 1500 by \"Maistre Barthole et Jehan petit\" (title, last line), and \"A paris, Au soleil d'or / en la maison Maistre bertholde\" (Fo. j. back, col. 1), as the \"Correcteur,\" P. Virgin, says. Prof. Paul Meyer refers me to three other Acrostics by DeGuileville on his own name: 1. in Le P\u00e8lerinage de l'Ame , Roxburghe Club, 1895, p. 57-64, in alternate French and Latin lines, beginning Grace Dieu, du ciel royne, Semper regnans sine fine, Cognoissant pous et orine, Et magistra medicine . . . and making the writer's name \"Guillermus de Guillevilla\" as above; 2. in the same volume, an Acrostic in French only, in three separate sections\u2014the third in but a few MSS.\u2014p. 348-53, 376-8 (see note, p. 356 there), having the guile with one l only: \"Guillermus de Guilevila\"; this begins, p. 348:\u2014 Gracieuse est l'assembl\u00e9e Qui n'est onques dessembl\u00e9e, Et en rien n'est descordable, Qui en .iii. est distincter . . . 3. In the P\u00e8lerinage Jhesucrist , Roxburghe Club, 1897, p. 119-130, in French only. This begins:\u2014 Glorieus Dieu, dont te vint il Qu'envoias ci aval ton fil, Et que pelerin le f\u00ebis Bien savoies, qu'en tel courtil, N'avoit pour li May ne Avril, Et son soulas point n'i v\u00ebis. This Acrostic makes the name \"Guillermus de Deguilevilla\"; but the editor of the Roxburghe volume, the late Prof. St\u00fcrzinger, notes on p. 125 that ten MSS. leave out one couple of the De stanzas, thus reducing the name to \"Guillermus de Guilevilla.\" I may add here that the prose treatise on the Virgin as the sinner's Refuge from Tribulation, and the Consolation of Afflicted Hearts, p. 437, etc., above, is substituted by Lydgate for about a page of DeGuileville's French verse, Foeillet. lvij., cols. 2-4, which I shall print in the Forewords to this Part II.", "12": "now I ha told myn \u00e1dventure of all that evar I dyd endure, of Scilla and her hound\u00ebs fell, and eke (as ye ha hard me tell) of Envy and of Treason, and of falce Detract\u00efon. how they ha wrought to my hyndrynge In the absens of the kynge and of his portar, in sertayne.

[Corresponds to English line] 24751 Ta vie, tantost faulcher entent, [Corresponds to English line] 24753 Et la mectre du tout \u00e0 fin; Et puis ton corps en vng cofin [Corresponds to English line] 24756 Elle mectra, pour le bailler [Corresponds to English line] 24758 Aux vers puans, pour le manger. [Corresponds to English line] 24759 Ceste chose est toute commune [Corresponds to English line] 24761 A tout chascun et a chascune: [Corresponds to English line] 24762 Homme, en ce monde, est expos\u00e9 A la mort, comme l'herbe au pr\u00e9 [Corresponds to English line] 24765 Est a la faulx / aussi est feyn, [Corresponds to English line] 24769 Qui huy est verd / et sec demain; Or as est\u00e9 verd vng long temps, [Corresponds to English line] 24772 Et si as receu pluyes et vens; [Corresponds to English line] 24766 Mais fault maintenant te faulchier, [Corresponds to English line] 24780 Et en deux pieces despiecer. [Corresponds to English line] 24782 L'huys est estroit / l'ame / et la cher [Corresponds to English line] 24783 Ne pourroient ensemble passer. [Corresponds to English line] 24786 L'ame premiere passera, [Corresponds to English line] 24787 Et puis apres la chair yra. [Corresponds to English line] 24788 Mais si tost ne sera ce mie; Auant sera la chair pourrie, [Corresponds to English line] 24790 Et autre fois regener\u00e9e [Corresponds to English line] 24792 En la grant commune assembl\u00e9e. Doncques regarde se apoinctey [Corresponds to English line] 24794 Deuement tu es, et appareilley. S'\u00e0 toy ne tient, tantost verras [Corresponds to English line] 24795 La grant cit\u00e9 ou tendu as. [Corresponds to English line] 24796 Tu es au guichet et \u00e0 l'huys [Corresponds to English line] 24800 Que ou mirouer piec\u00e0 tu vis. [Corresponds to English line] 24802 Se tu es despoill\u00e9 et nuz, Dedans tantost seras receuz. Celle entr\u00e9e tu auoies moult chier, Lors quant tu la vis au premier; Et toutesfois, tant ie te dy, [Corresponds to English line] 24807 Qu'\u00e0 mon p\u00e8re tu cryes mercy, [Corresponds to English line] 24808 En prometant \u00e0 penitence, [Corresponds to English line] 24809 Que, se n'en as \u00e0 souffisance [Corresponds to English line] 24810 Fait / volentiers tu la feras [Corresponds to English line] 24813 En purgatoire, ou tu iras. [Corresponds to English line] 24816 LE PELERIN. OR vous dy ie / que lors se i'eusse Peu bien parler / que ie luy eusse [Corresponds to English line] 24821 Fait des demandes dont i'auoye [Corresponds to English line] 24824 Grant doubte / et que pas ne sauoie, Folie est d'actendre au besoing, [Corresponds to English line] 24822 Car souuent on cuide que loing Soit la mort; qu'elle est aux postis, [Corresponds to English line] 24826 Bien ie le sceu / ie fuz soubzpris. La mort laissa sa faulx courir, [Corresponds to English line] 24827 Et me fist du corps departir. [Corresponds to English line] 24830 Ce me sembla en ce moment, Si que, de l'espouentement Esueill\u00e9 et desdormy fu, [Corresponds to English line] 24832 Et me trouuay si esperdu, [not englisht] Qu'auiser ie ne me pouoie Se ia mort ou en vie i'estoie, Jusqu'\u00e0 tant que i'ouy sonner L'orologe de nuyt, pour leuer: Et aussi lors chantoient les cocqs; Pour quoy, leuer me cuiday lors; Mais ne peu / car fuz retenu De la grant pens\u00e9e ou ie fu Pour le myen aduentureux songe, Ou quel, se quelque vne mensonge Estoit mesl\u00e9e ou contenue, Ou qui fust de peu de value. Nul esmerueiller ne s'en doit, Car iamais froment on ne voit Croistre / qu'entour paille n'y aye, Jusques que dehors on l'en traye; Par quoy, s'en mon songe y a grain, Et auecques paille ou estrain y ait / ce qu'est bon / soit gard\u00e9; Ce que n'est bon, soit hors venn\u00e9. Que ne dy pas tant seulement Pour ce premier liure present, Dont cy endroit ie feray fin, Pour me reposer en chemin, Mais aussi pour ce que s'ensuit, Ou tout le grain en paille gist, Que recommande aux bons venneurs, Qui sceuent hors venner erreurs. \u00b6 La fin du premier p\u00e8lerinaige De l'homme durant qu'est En vie.
