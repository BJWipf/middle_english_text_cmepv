THE MANOR OF BIERTON [ c. 1360?] Richard Fitzjohn, who died in 1297, left the manor of Aylesbury and hamlet of Bierton to his wife Emma. His heirs were his four sisters, Maud, wife of William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Isabel, wife of Robert de Vipont (whose daughters were Isabel, wife of Roger Clifford, and Idonea, wife of Roger Leyburne), Avelina, wife of Walter de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, and Joan, wife of Theobald le Botiller ( d. 1285), great-grandfather of James le Botiller, 1st Earl of Ormonde ( Calend. Genealogicum , ii, 540-1, 563; Cal. Inq. , iii, p. 283; Cal. Close Rolls , Ed. III, ii, 429). The genealogy of the following document is therefore hopelessly wrong. John de Stonor, the chief justice, held Bierton by knight-service of the Earl of Ormonde ( Feudal Aids ). From A.C. , xlvi, 6. Domina Emmota le Mohaute, domina de Beerton, habuit quatuor filias, quarum Dux Lancastrie unam duxit, alteram dominus de March duxit, terciam dominus Warre duxit, quartam Beket, dominus de Or|mond, duxit; et sic quatripartum fuit illud dominium de Beerton. Unde dicit dictus Johannes Dalby, senior, quod omnia terra et tene|menta que fuere domini Johannis Stonor deveniebant a domino de March pro antecessore dicti domini de Stonor perquisita, et excepta una prepostura jacente inter le Beerton Grene, aliter terre nec prata, neque pasture tenementa de Beket, dominus de Ormond, per redditus et ser|vicia nec racione alicujus tenoris alterius.", "5": "6.

ACCOUNT OF JOHN WAREFELD, RECEIVER FOR THOMAS STONOR 1416-17 This account is of sufficient interest to justify a fairly full summary.

HURLEGH TO THOMAS STONOR 28 SEPTEMBER [1424 or earlier] The writer, who was clearly connected with Salisbury, is probably the John Hurlegh, who was prebendary of Ramsbury in 1414, Warden of the Hospital of St. Nicholas, Salisbury, from 1418-20, and rector of Kingston Deverell; he died in 1425 (Wordsworth, Cartulary of St. Nicholas Hospital , p. 211; for another reference to him see Cal. Pat. Rolls , Henry VI, i, 234). Golafre, Warfield and Hurlegh were three of Stonor's feoffees of Ermington (see p. 36 below). Warfield was also Stonor's receiver (see No. 41). A Nicholas Cassy of Gloucester occurs in 1427-29, and a John Cassy of Gloucester in 1434 ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Henry VI, i, 376, 515; ii, 372).

THE INDENTURE FOR RICHARD AND AGNES FORTESCU 29 SEPTEMBER, 1424 This is a draft, on paper, of the deed which Thomas Stonor enclosed in the following letter. The original ( Ancient Deeds , C. 3015) has some altera|tions which it was not worth showing. The last three lines are added in another hand. The deed has a certain interest as having been drafted by the famous Sir John Fortescue, then quite a young lawyer: it is perhaps too much to assume that any part of the draft is in his handwriting. Richard Fortescue was the third son of Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice; he was killed at St. Albans in 1455 (Stow, Annales , p. 399); the deed shows that it was he who married Agnes, daughter of Richard Holcombe, and not his son as commonly stated ( Works of Sir J. Fortescue , ii, 151-2, ed. Lord Clermont). This Indenture was possibly the sequel of an earlier dispute, as to which there was a Petition in Chancery by Thomas Chaucer, John Golafre, John Hurlegh, \"chapeleyn,\" John Warefeld, and Thomas Berdelegh, showing that they were seised of the manor and hundred of Ermington, till one Richard Fortescu of great malice and forethought made a forcible entry and broke down hedges and ditches. The Petition mentions \"John Fortescu, pier a dit Richard, et John Bosan, son frier en ley\" ( Early Chancery Proceedings , 69/24 P.R.O.). Hec Indentura facta apud Ermyngton in Comitatu Devon. in festo sancti Michaelis Archangeli, anno regni Henrici sexti post conquestum Anglie tercio, inter Thomam Chaucer, Johannem Golafre, Hamonem Belknap, dominos Manerii de Ermyngton predicto, ex parte una, et \n  Ricardum Fortescu et Agnetem uxorem ejus ex parte altera: testatur quod cum iidem Ricardus et Agnes, ut in jure ipsius Agnetis, clama|verunt communam pasturam in grosso ad omnia animalia sua temporibus apertis depascenda per totum dominium Manerii predicti in parte occidentali cujusdam fossati, quod vocatur la Yalthadych, quod vero fossatum jacet per divisa de aqua de Ermyn versus terram de Prutaston inter dominium de Ermyngton et sanctuarium ejusdem luci, Probably an error for \"loci\". et ultra linaliter a capite ejusdem fossati versus ad terram de Prutaston, ex con|cessione cujusdam Johannis Peverell, nuper domini Manerii predicti, facta cuidam Ricardo de Holecombe antecessori predicte Agnetis, cujus heres ipsa est, prout in eodem scripto inde confecto plenius continetur, ubi predictus Ricardus de Holecombe nec aliquis heredum vel assigna|torum suorum unquam aliquam communam pasturam in Manerio pre|dicto habuerunt seu de jure habere debuerunt, prout ex parte predictorum Thome Chaucer, Johannis Golafre, et Hamonis Belknap asseritur.

THOMAS STONOR TO [SIR JOHN FORTESCUE] [30 OCTOBER, 1424] The reference to \"my uncle Belknap\" shows that the writer of this letter was Thomas Stonor ( d. 1431), whose mother was a daughter of Sir Robert Belknap. The previous document (which is clearly \"your son Richard's\" in|denture) gives the date 1424, and shows that the letter was addressed to Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice: the Chief Justice first appears as \"gubernator\" at Lincoln's Inn in 1425, so that this letter is perhaps the earliest extant reference to him in his legal career. Richard Fortescue, the judge's younger brother, is noticed on p. 36 above. Wytbury is probably the John Wydbury of Cornwall, who occurs in conjunction with John Crokker of Lyneham, near Ermington, in February, 1422 ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Henry V, ii, 423); he may be the same as the John Wydbury of Southampton, squire, who died before February, 1423 ( ibid. , Henry VI, i, 48). The letter like the foregoing deed seems to be a draft kept by Stonor for reference; this explains the absence of any endorsement. From A.C. , xlvi, 37.

TO THOMAS STONOR [ c. 1425] This is a fragment of a letter, which from the mention of \"master Chaucer\" (Thomas Chaucer, who died in 1434) must have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor. The reference to \"Dymmok\" indicates that the letter had to do with Ermington. \"Wonard\" may possibly be William Wynnard, grandfather of Agnes Stonor (see No. 261). John Cottesmore, who was afterwards (1429-1439) a judge of the Common Pleas and chief justice in 1439, was on the commission of peace for Devonshire from 1424 to 1427; he had lands in Berks and Oxfordshire, and his grandson married a grand|daughter of Thomas Stonor (see No. 107). From A.C. , xlvi, 87. . . . so Wonard sende me yn a letter that he koude not speke wyth Dymmok att noe leyser sethen my last beyng at home; boot att the assisis, yf he koude entrete hym to an ende resonable, he and I wuld make an ende alle so wel after oure day as afore: which assis begynnyth a goode while after the decollacion above said: boot I may not be there: wherefore my conceile ys fully that ye yn alle hast doe sende thether letters, or froe my maister Chauceire, or froe my lord of Wyn|chester, or rather than to faile froe your selve, by good avice concevid, and that my maister Cotysmore, that is there justeice &c., may do your erant by mouthe unto Wonard, and so I wote. . . . .

JOHN HAMME TO [THOMAS STONOR] [ c. 1425] There is no indication of date in this letter, nor is the name of the person to whom it was written given. But the writer is probably the John Hampne who was bailiff at Horton in 1419-20 ( Ministers Accounts , 1250/2, see vol. ii, p. 179). It must therefore have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor. With this the reference to John Martyn agrees, for there was a John Martyn on the commission of peace for Kent from 1413-36. In any case it would have been difficult to assign the letter to the time of the second Thomas Stonor; for Alice Drayton owned Horton till her death in October, 1468, and John Forth was bailiff in October, 1469 (see No. 101). The letter is now separated from the Stonor papers, to which it no doubt belongs, and is in A.C. , li, 63. To my Worshipful lord. I recomaunde me to &yogh;ow with alle my herte.

Misc. , 37, ix, 8-9, contains an abstract\u2014in Latin\u2014of Thomas Stonor's will, with a valuation, on four pages, the last being blank. Though reproducing no doubt the whole substance and often the exact words it does not appear to be a complete copy. It will be sufficient to give its purport. \"Voluntas T. de S. scilicet quod\"\u2014Alice his wife to have in dower the Manor of Ermington, the Manor of Harnhull with the advowson, the Manor of Beerton juxta Ailesbury, and the Manor of la Mote in West|minster, their value being \u00a3402. 13. 4. His wife is to have for life all lands and tenements acquired in Clyve, Westbere, Chestelet, Hopelond, Stureye, and Horton in Kent, and the Manor of Penyton Meysy with the advowson, for the sustinence and finding in food, clothes and education ( in victu, vestitu et doctrina ) of his daughters. Thomas Chaucer, whilst alive, is to have the governance and supervi|sion of his son and heir Thomas, with the issues and profits of the Manor of Hembury for his sustinence till the age of twenty-one. The marriage of his said son is to be sold by Chaucer, his wife Alice, his brother John Hampden, and John Warfeld. The proceeds are to be applied for the marriages of his daughters, Elizabeth, Maud, Philippa, Joan, and Anne, together with the issues and profits of the Manors of Dodecote, Sottewell, and Bensheves, Berks, and Stonor, Watlyngton and Cleyore in Oxfordshire. His daughters are during their minority to be in the governance of his widow, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld. Each daughter is to have 200 marks at least for her marriage. They are to be married in order of age. If one or more should die unmarried ( quod absit ), her portion is to be divided equally amongst the survivors. If through the death of his said sons \"Predicti filii mei;\" but only Thomas has so far been named. under age without legitimate issue, his daughters inherit his lands, the payments of the said 200 marks are to lapse. His wife, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld are then to dispose of the profits of the marriages of his male heirs and of the said Manors during the minority of his heirs in discharge of his conscience, according to the will and ordinance of his parents and ancestors as in their last wills more fully appears. In the event of his wife's death his son John is to have the reversion of the Manor of Burewardescote on condition that he release to his brother Thomas his right in gavelkind to all lands in Kent, as well those which Thomas Stonor held in right of his wife as those newly acquired.

ALBANS 21-22 MAY, 1455 Amongst the Ch. Misc. , 37, iii, 4-11, there is an English narrative of the Battle of St. Albans, which seems to have been written and circulated in the interest of the Yorkist party. It was communicated to Arch\u00e6ologia (vol. xx, pp. 519-22) in 1822 by John Bayley, keeper of the Records in the Tower, who attributed it to Sir William Stonor, misled as it would seem by the fact that Sir William Stonor was 24 years afterwards steward of St. Albans Abbey at Wallingford (see No. 244). The presence of the document amongst the Stonor MSS. seems to be accidental. Dr. Gairdner reprinted the text from Arch\u00e6ologia in the Paston Letters , No. 283. There is thus no need to re|print it here, though it seems right to record the source whence it was derived. Apart from some slight variations in spelling the printed text is accurate, ex|cept at two points. The name of the place in St. Peter's Street, where the King's banner was pitched, should be \"Goslawe\" not \"Boslawe\". In the list of Lords who were hurt there should be inserted between Buckingham and Stafford: \"the lord of Dudle with an arowe in the vysage\". The original is on a large sheet of paper folded to make 16 pages; the narrative is written on the first 6\u00bd pages.", "59": "60. JOHN ELMES TO THOMAS STONOR 6th FEB. [? 1457] The 6th of February fell on a Sunday in 1452, 1457, 1463, and 1474. If the writer may be identified with John Elmys, the merchant of Henley, who occurs in 1443 ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Henry VI, iv, 169), the most likely date is 1457. \"My lady your sister\" is clearly Isabel, wife of Thomas Sackville of Falley or Fawley, which is halfway between Stonor and Henley. Thomas Sackville died in 1466, and if this letter is read as implying that Isabel Sack|ville was a widow, the date must be 1474. From A.C. , xlvi, 43.

THOMAS HAMPTON TO THOMAS STONOR [1462] The history of Mistress Swete's case is too complicated for treatment here and has therefore been given at length in an Appendix to the Introduction\u2014see pp. xlviii-lvi above. This and No. 67 were clearly written whilst the litiga|tion was pending,.and since No. 67 is dated 31st August both letters must be ascribed to 1462; after July, 1463, Mistress Swete's friends could no longer have believed that Thomas Romesey was son of Sir Walter and his first wife Joan. The writer was Hampton of Kimble\u2014see Nos. 68 and 76. It is diffi|cult to tell why he calls Mistress Swete his sister, unless Hampton's wife was a sister of Thomas Swete. Stapulham (now Staplefarm) was a vill or tithing in the Hundred of South Damerham, Wilts. I have not discovered what place is meant by Sylverton. From A.C. , xlvi, 54.

And but because off him the parish wer like to have more favor off the straw, the said parson toke to him Richard Colleman and Williham Harries to be parcenars with him after the price he bought itt, and fully agreed: and the next day after the parson denyed it, and wrongly to put hem from the bargeyne.

THOMAS AND MARGERY HAMPDEN TO THOMAS STONOR [ c. 1465] Since Thomas Stonor, the elder, had not been dead (as it would seem) forty years, this letter cannot be later than 1470, whilst the reference to \"your sons\" makes it unlikely that it was earlier than 1465.

Perhaps they may be a draft of some contemplated proceedings in 1466, when the complaint of John Frende was presented in Chancery\u2014see No. 80. More is possibly Sir John More, the father of Sir Thomas More. For Reyny, who was a Devon|shire lawyer, see No. 100. Exst is possibly the Thomas Hext of Nos. 263 and 284. From Ch. Misc. , 37, iii, 15. Memorandum of divers Artycles ayenst Richard Fortescu. First, where that ther was award made by More, Reyny, and Huddysfild, and in that award among othyr thynggis to be done the seyde Richard shuld relese all manere of accion personall to suche per|sonys as shuld be deliveryd to the seyde Richard by byll by the hondys of Thomas Stonore: the seyde Thomas deliveryd to the seyde Rychard a bylle endentyd of certeyne namys, the wyche where never relest unto: and for defaute of suche reles many of the personys where sore amercyd and troubyld to the charge and coste of the seyde Thomas &c.

RICHARD FORTESCUE [1466] Though these documents do not form part of the Stonor Papers they are important for the history of the dispute at Ermington. The date is fixed by the proceedings in the King's Bench, where it appears that the date of the assault on Frende was in December, 1465. The appearance of Stonor and Thomas Mulle (who no doubt represented Richard Drayton) shows that \"plegii de prosequendo\" were in some cases at all events genuine persons, although it has been argued that the pledges were usually fictitious persons (like John Doe and Richard Roe); the Richard Gryme and William Lyme of p. 79 below may be such a fictitious instance. From Early Chancery Proceedings , 31/34-36. To the right reverend ffader in God, tharchebusshop of Yorke and Chaunceller of Engelond. Mekely besecheth and peteously complayneth your poor and con|tinuell Oratour, John Frende, graciously to concydre that Richard Fortescu of Ermynton in the Counte of Devonshir, squyer, with other riotus persones to hym assembled to the nombre of iiij xx persones and moo, ryotously arrayed in fourme of warre, that is to sey with Jackys, Bowes, Arrowes, Swerdes, Gleyves, and other defencible wepyns, the xij day of Decembre laste passed ayenste the pees of our sovereign lord \n  the Kynge at Ermynton aforsaid ryotusly and ayenste the lawe come and tooke your seid Oratour oute of his hows as his prisoner, and hym ladd unto the hows of the seyd Richard Fortescue, and ther hym in pryson kepte by the space of iiij dayes unto the tyme your seid Oratour had payed for the delyveraunce and raunsom to the seid Richard Fortescue v. marc. And gracyous lord, your seid Oratour is in such poverte that he is not of power to sue for his remedy accordyng to the cours of the comone lawe of the londe, and so standyth as withowte remedy withowte your good grace be shewed to hym in this behalf. Wherfore, plese it your good lordeship gracyusly to concydre the pre|misses, and ther uppon to graunte a writte sub pena to be directed to the seid Richard Fortescue, commaundyng hym by the same to appere before the Kynge in Chauncerye at a certene day and under a certene peyne by you to be lymytyd ther to answer to the premisses, and to do and resceyve as concyence askyth and requyreth, and this for the love of god and in the wey of charyte. Plegii de prosequendo; Thomas Stonour de London, armig.; Thomas Mulle de London, gent. This is the answere of Richard Fortescue to the bill putt ageynst hym by John Frende. Fyrst, the seid Richard seith bi protestacion that the mater conteyned in the seid bill is mater determinable by the comon lawe of the land and noght in this Courte: bott for his answer and pleyn declaracion of the same he seith that he longe tyme before the seid arrest had a Wryte of Supplicavit oute of this Courte ageynst the seid John, directed to the Shyrryf of Devonshyr, the which Shyrryf made a Warraunte uppon the same Wryte to John Hillyour, John Saundre, William Screch, and Thomas Horne, jointly and severally to tak and arrest the seid John accordyng to the content of the seid Wryte: bi vertue of which Warraunte the seid John, John, William and Thomas arrestyd \u00fee seid John in pesible wyse at Ermyngton, beyng oute of his hows, and hym from thens had toward the Kynges comon Jale by the howse of the seid Richard, and thair taried with hym bi the space of half an houre: and the same John so beyng in the howse of the seid Richard, the same Richard fortunyd to come home fyndyng the seid John in his howse undre arrest as is afforseid, withoute that the seid Richard in riotous wyse or in such fourme tok and imprisonyd the seid John in \n  maner and fourme as he hath allegyd, and withoute that \u00fee seid Richard tok or made to be takyn the seid John or hym kepyd in prison in house langer or in eny othere maner and fourme than the seid Richard hath before rehersyd &c. Moreover, the seid Richard seith that the seid John hath an accion of faux imprisonment hangyng ageynst \u00fee seid Richard in the Comon place, The record of this action appears in Hilary Term 1466, in Placita de Banco , Roll, 818, m. 251: Devon. Johannes Frende per attornatum suum optulit se iiij to die versus Ricardum Fortescu de Ermyngton in comitatu predicto, gentilman, Thomam Horne de Ermyngton in comitatu predicto, husbondman, Willelmum Screche nuper de Ermyngton in comitatu predicto, grome, et Johannem Saunder de Ermyngton in comitatu predicto, souter, de placito quare vi et armis in ipsum Johannem Frende apud Ermyngton insultum fecerunt et ipsum verberaverunt, vulneraverunt, imprisonaverunt et male tractaverunt, et ipsum ibidem sic in prisona contra legem et consuetudinem regni Regis Anglie diu detinuerunt, et alia enormia &c., ad grave dampnum &c, et contra pacem Regis &c. Et ipsi non venerunt, et preceptum fuit Vicecomiti quod attachiet eos &c. Et de prefato Ricardo mandat Vicecomes'quod attachiatus est per plegia Johannis Lok et Ricardi Cok. Ideo ipsi in manu &c.

Ideo tam predictus Ricardus sicut prius dis|tringatur, quam predicti alii defendentes capiantur quod sint hic in crastino Sancti Johannis Baptiste. There appears to be no entry in the Roll for Trinity Term, and the proceedings in the Common Pleas were presumably dropped. bi reason the seid arrest, which is ageynst all consciens he to be vexed here and in the Comon place and all for on thyng. All which maters the seid Richard is redy to profe as this Courte will reule hym, and prayeth \u00feat he may be dismissed out of this Courte with his costes and damages for his wrongfull vexacion. This is the Replicacion of John Frende unto the aunswere of Richard Fortescu. The seid John Frende by protestacion nat knowyng ony writte of Supplicavit had ageyn hym nor ony warant made be the seid Shyryve to John Saundre and other to arreste the seid John Frende in maner and fourme as ys supposed by the seid aunswere: but for aunswere the said John Frende seith in dede that he was arested and taken in riotous wise by the said Richard Fortescu and other, and lad to the hous of the same Richard and as a prisoner kept in maner and fourme specified in the seid bill: and over that he seith that he was atte that tyme ther putte in dures in to Stokkes and gretly manassed and thretenyd and put in fere of bodily harme: and many tymes sithen the seid em|prisonement \n  the seid Richard Fortescu hath thretened the seid John Frend and putte hym in greate feere boith of his persone and losse of his goodis, so that he thurst nat attend his husbondrye, to his import|able losse, hurte, and greff, havyng in his hand as moche land in ferme as he paiethe therfor xl. li.; withoute that atte the tyme of the seid takyng, arestynge or imprisonement of the seid John Frend ony warant from the seid Shirive to him was shewed: which mater the seid John Frend is redy to prove like as the Courte will award: and prayeth that the seid Richard for the seid riote may be commytted to ward, and that he may be compellid to yeld to the seid John Frend reson|able damages for his seid grete hurtys and wrongefulle vexacion, and also the costys of his suyte.", "80": "81. JOHN YEME TO THOMAS STONOR 11 JUNE [? 1466] Since Frende was still bailiff in Dec., 1465\u2014see p. 79 below\u2014the year is probably 1466. From the reference to Plympton and Trematon Courts it would seem likely to be of about the same date as the Articles\u2014No. 79. Thomas Stonor was apparently in London in May, 1466\u2014see pp. 79, 80; but the date may possibly be 1467. For Yeme as bailiff, see further No. 126.

PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUIT OF STONOR VERSUS FORTESCUE 1466-68 The Stonor Manuscripts in Chancery Miscellanea , 37, iii, 44, include a copy, of the pleadings in the King's Bench in Trinity Term, 1467, reciting the pro|ceedings in Chancery of the previous year. To complete the history of the case extracts are given from the Coram Rege Rolls down to Michaelmas, 1468, at which time Thomas Stonor's letter\u2014No. 91\u2014shows that Richard Fortescue was finally dismissed. The reason for the description of Thomas Stonor as a servant of the Archbishop of York is obscure\u2014but see No. 97; he may have been steward of one of the archbishop's manors.

Et quoad insultum, capcionem, et imprisonacionem, et in prisona detencionem, illos idem Ricardus dicit quod predictus Thomas Stonore accionem suam predictam inde versus eum manutenere non debet. Quia dicit quod diu ante predictum tempus quo supponitur transgressionem predictam fieri, scilicet sextodecimo die Octobris, anno regni domini Regis nunc quinto, idem Ricardus Fortescu prosecutus fuit quoddam breve domini Regis de supplicavit extra curiam cancellarie domini Regis Vicecomiti Devon. directum Christoforo Wurs|ley, armigero, nunc et tunc vicecomiti comitatus predicti existenti, ad capiendum predictum Johannem Frende, ac quosdam Willelmum Lusshe, Willelmum Willyng, Robertum Frende, et Thomam Martyn, necnon eos ad proximam gaolam domini Regis in comitatu predicto ducendos, quousque ipsi invenissent, et eorum quilibet invenisset eidem domino Regi sufficientem securitatem de pace gerenda erga dominum Regem et cunctum populum suum, et precipue erga ipsum Ricardum Fortescu.

HUMPHREY FORSTER TO THOMAS STONOR 21 OCTOBER [1466] This seems to have reference to the death of Thomas Sackvile of Falley or Fawley in 1466\u2014see Nos. 88 and 89. Sackvile's wife Isabel was a sister of Thomas Stonor and of Forster's wife. Rokes was Sackvile's nephew and heir (see note on No. 89). In Ch. Misc. , 37, ix, 38-39, there is the rough draft of a contract of marriage between Thomas, eldest son and heir-apparent of Thomas Rokes, and a daughter (unnamed) of Stonor. If the said daughter died \"before flesshly knowleche had\" another daughter, if unmarried and of convenient age, was to take her place. Rokes bargained to make a grant of the reversion of the lands which Isabel, late wife of Thomas Sakevyle, held for life, to the value of 20 marks a year, and of other lands to the value of 10 marks. If Rokes' son at the age of fourteen and Stonor's daughter at the age of thirteen disagree the contract was to be void. The marriage does not seem to have ever taken effect though it was still being discussed in 1477\u2014see No. 179. The marriage contract was probably drafted about the date of this letter.

The second Thomas Sakeville had a son Thomas and a daughter Margery. The third Thomas is probably the husband of Isabel, sister of Thomas Stonor ( d. 1474). Margery married Thomas Rokes, no doubt the Thomas Rokes the elder of Ascot and Wing who died in 1457, and mentions in his will Margery his wife, and his sons John Rokes and Robert Rufford. For a lawsuit by his executors see Placita de Banco , 818, m. 41. He was presumably the father of Thomas Rokes the writer of this letter, who calls Isabel Sackville his aunt, for in an inquisition held in 1487 it was found that Thomas Rokes son of Margery Sakeville inherited property granted to N. Kentwood as heir of Sir Thomas Sakeville. Thomas Rokes the younger calls Thomas Stonor his brother, and must therefore have been married to his sister or half-sister; from No. 182 it appears that his wife's name was Alice, and since Alice daughter of the elder Thomas Stonor was married to Humphrey Forster, it is probable that Alice Rokes was a daughter of Alice and Richard Drayton (Wrottesley, Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls , pp. 438, 441, 458; Cal. Inq. , Henry VII, i, 317; P.C.C. , 12 Stokton, will of T. Rokes, 1457; Sede Vacante Wills , Kent Records, will of T. Rokes, 1500). A pedigree in Harley MS. , 1139, f. 45, makes the second Thomas Rokes of Falley marry a daughter of Fowler of Ricote, and his son, a third Thomas, marry a daughter of Sir William Stonor; the last statement is certainly incorrect. See p. 93 above. From A.C. , xlvi, 70.

THOMAS STONOR TO JANE STONOR 8 OCTOBER, 1468 This was clearly written by Thomas Stonor to his wife, on the occasion of the death of his mother and her second husband, Richard Drayton, in October, 1468; it shows that Alice died on 1st October and Richard on 3rd October. \"My adversary of Devonshire\" is of course Richard Fortescue (see No. 82), where it appears that the lawsuit finally ended in Michaelmas Term, 1468. The \"xliij gentylmen\" were presumably the panel for the jury of twenty-four who were summoned to appear on the octaves of Michaelmas. From A.C. xlvi, 243. Myne oone good Jane, as hertely as I can I recumaunde me to yow.

JOHN CROOCKER TO THOMAS STONOR 18 OCTOBER, [1468] In Michaelmas Term, 1467, a writ was issued to the Sheriff of Devon to bring up William Saunder, Hugh Helyer, John Roberd and William Skryche \n  of Ermyngton on the morrow of St. Andrew (1 Dec.) to show cause why they should not pay 10l. damages which Richard Drayton had lately recovered against them for trespass. They failed to appear, and were cited for Hilary Term, when it was ordered that Drayton should have execution. In Trinity Term, 1468, a writ of exigi facias was issued to the Sheriff against them. ( Coram Rege Rolls , 826, m. 41, and 829, m. 105; see also p. 83 above.) Thus the date of this letter is 18 Oct., 1468, a fortnight after Drayton's death. Lyneham is in Yealmpton, not far from Ermington. The writer is no doubt the John Crocker who was knighted in 1471 and died in 1508-9, and is commemorated on a brass in Yealmpton Church. From A.C. , xlvi, 40. Ryght worshipful cosyn and frende, I commawnde me unto you.

ACCOUNTS BY NICHOLAS WENDOVER 1468-72 Wendover may possibly have been in the service of Thomas Stonor.

RICHARD QUATERMAYNS TO THOMAS STONOR AND HUMPHREY FORSTER [? 1467 or 1468] In the absence of any clue to the commission referred to, and of any certainty as to the feast intended by St. Thomas Day, it is difficult to fix the \n  date of this letter. But Richard Croft, Stonor and Forster were not on the commission of peace for Oxfordshire or the town of Oxford in the reign of Henry VI. Quatermayns, William Marmyon and Croft appear on a special commission in the county in 1463 ( C. P. R. , Edw. IV, i, 278), but I have not found any commission relating to the town. Since Stonor was not sheriff, 1465-66 is impossible. If St. Thomas Day means 7 July (Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr) the year is probably 1467, when 7 July was a Tuesday; if it means 21 Dec. (St. Thomas the Apostle) the year is probably 1468, when 21 Dec. was on a Wednesday. There were sessions of Parliament in June, 1467, and in May, 1468. The subsidy voted on the latter occasion was being collected in Nov.-Dec. following ( Rot. Parl. , vi, 233). From A.C. , xlvi, 66.

THOMAS STONOR TO WILLIAM STONOR [1468 or 1469] Since the Archbishop of York must be George Neville, who was in prison from April, 1472, till late in 1475, the date of this letter cannot be later than 1471. In 1471 St. Peter's Day was on a Saturday, and in 1470 on a Friday; therefore neither of those years are probable. As the letter is written to William Stonor the date is not likely to be earlier than 1468 or 1469. Thomas Stonor is styled \"one of the servants of George, Archbishop of York\" in No. 82.

The reference to William Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarren ( d. 1471) and to his brother, the Earl of Essex, indicates that the date was between 1462 and 1470.

THOMAS MULL TO THOMAS STONOR [1469] The reference to \"my moder and your\" shows that this was written to Thomas Stonor. Mull had presumably married a daughter of Alice Drayton by her second husband.

The letter may perhaps imply that Stonor had been present in the Parliament; the second Thomas Stonor was M.P. for Oxfordshire in 1447 and 1449, but the reference to his wife makes the first of these years unlikely; it may, however, belong to 1449. There are, however, no Returns of Members of Parliament for 1455, 1461, 1463 and 1470, and Stonor may have sat in one of these Parliaments. But Richard Restwold was a party to the deed of 1 Dec., 1432\u2014No. 56\u2014and the letter may have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor, who sat in the Parliaments of 1429 and 1431.

[? 1470] The chief subject of this letter was clearly the marriage of Thomas Stonor's ward, John Cottesmore, to one of his daughters\u2014probably Joan\u2014see Nos. 128 and 136. I cannot explain why Harcourt addresses Stonor as \"my ffadyr\". The letter would naturally imply that Harcourt was married to a daughter of Thomas Stonor, and that a son or daughter of his by a former wife was going to marry a daughter or son of Thomas Stonor. But Richard Harcourt is said to have married (1) Edith, daughter of Thomas Sencler or St. Clere, by whom he had a son Christopher and a daughter Anne; (2) Eleanor, daughter of Sir Roger Lewknor, by whom he had a son John, who married Margaret, daughter of William Bray; and (3) Katherine, \n  daughter of Sir Thomas de la Pole, and widow of Sir Miles Stapleton, by whom he had a son William. Christopher Harcourt married Joan, younger daughter of Sir Miles and Katherine Stapleton. Anne Harcourt married Henry Fiennes, Lord Say. In his will Harcourt mentions two other daughters, Isabell, and Alice, wife of William Besillys. He mentions his two wives, Edith and Katherine, but there is no reference to Eleanor nor to her alleged son John. (See Collins' Peerage , iv, 436-7, ed. Brydges; Harcourt Papers , i, 73-6; Blomefield, History of Norfolk , ix, 320-21; P.C.C. , 27 Logge.) It would be a simple solution to the difficulty if we could suppose that the Richard Harcourt of this letter was a different person to the well-known knight. But the writer of No. 145 was certainly Sir Richard Harcourt, and the signatures of both letters are in the same hand, and have paraphs of identical design. Moreover, Sir Richard Harcourt and Thomas Stonor were co-feoffees for Katherine Arundel (see No. 125). The pretended relationship must therefore remain a mystery. In his letter to William Stonor (No. 145) Harcourt signs himself as \"your loving cosyn,\" but in this letter refers to \"my brother William Stonor\". If there had been a child-marriage between children of Harcourt and Stonor it would explain \"my daughter and yours\"; but even of this there is no evidence, though if one of the parties had died young that would be not unnatural. As to the date of the letter the reference to Harcourt's business about the King's matters would suggest 1467, when he was sheriff of Oxon and Berks. But since Sir Miles Stapleton only died in October, 1466, Harcourt is not very likely to have married his widow before 1 Feb., 1467. Moreover, the marriage of Cottesmore to Thomas Stonor's daughter was some time later than October, 1468\u2014see No. 137. This letter is therefore probably not later than 1 Feb., 1470. Dame Katherine Harcourt was niece by marriage to Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which makes the reference to \"our own good lady\" natural. This letter may just possibly be holograph; but probably is signed only, like No. 145. From A.C. , xlvi, 57. My Ryght worshepfull fadyr, I recumaund me to &yogh;ow as hertely as I can: and it leke &yogh;ow to wete, acordyng to &yogh;owr wrytyng I send Cottys|more to London to have his aray made ther after &yogh;owr desyer, a long goune of cremesyn clothe and a nothyr long goune of blew clothe: and I prey &yogh;ow \u00feat my servaunt may know wher \u00fee clothe schal be bowth for my dowter and yours, \u00feat Cottysmore may have of the same clothe, and a frend of myn schal pay \u00feerfor tyl \u00feat I come to London, as for hys part.

WADEHILL TO THOMAS STONOR 17 JANUARY [1471?] This letter from a servant of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was clearly written after the birth of the Duke's eldest son, John, who was probably born in 1464, and before the death of his mother, the Duchess Alice, in May, 1475. The only intervening years in which 17th January fell on a Thursday were 1465 and 1471. The former seems precluded by the mention of \"the young ladies,\" since Suffolk's daughters were probably younger children; though the fact that an adjourned Parliament met in 1465 on 21st January would make this date otherwise suitable. The date 1471 is difficult, since it involves a reference to an otherwise unknown meeting of the Parliament of the Lancastrian Restoration. The Chancellor in both years was George Neville, Archbishop of York, with whom the Stonors had friendly relations. Suffolk, who was married to a sister of Edward IV., would naturally desire to keep away from Court in 1471. From A.C. , xlvi, 85.

Barantyne also had a dispute with Thomas Mylle or Mull as executor of Richard Drayton, with reference to a bond in surety for an annuity on the manor of Churchill; this was not earlier than 1469 ( id. 45/98).

After Stonor's death, and the death of Sir John Arundell, Katherine filed a petition in Chancery showing that Harcourt had refused to make an estate to her; \"William Menwynnek de Lostwythyell, gentilman,\" was then one of her sureties ( Early Chancery Proceedings , 66/140, P.R.O.). \"Wynyanton\" or Winnington is in the parish of Gunwalloe, and Kennall in the parish of Stithians; for deeds relating thereto, see Ancient Deeds, A. 10303, A. 10409. In 1481 Sir James Tyrell and Anne his wife brought an action against Sir Richard Harcourt for the manors of Nansladron, Carmynowe, Kenell and Wynyanton; Harcourt in his reply stated that Kenell and Wynyanton were held by Richard Tomyowe; Edward Grymston was then dead ( Placita de Banco , Roll 876, m. 458).

WILLIAM STONOR TO THOMAS STONOR [? 20 APRIL, 1473] The most probable year is 1473. In 1471 St. George's Day was on a Thursday, so that year is out of the question. In April-May, 1472, William Stonor seems to have been at Horton and in London (see Nos. 121 and 122); in this letter he proposes to come home by Henbury. The letter has to do with the dispute about the water of Erme, of which we hear first in the pre|vious letter, and get the conclusion in No. 184. Selenger is probably Thomas St. Leger, who was on the commission of peace for Devonshire. As to Lady Arundell, see No. 125. From A.C. , xlvi, 74.

A BAILIFF AT BRIDPORT TO HIS MASTER, TOGETHER WITH AN AGREE|MENT BETWEEN CRISTINE AND ROB|ERT BATTESCOMB 8 DEC., 1473 Ancient Correspondence , xlvi, 88, is a sheet of paper containing copies of three documents which do not appear to belong properly to the Stonor Papers. The first is a copy of the Latin Letters of Presentation addressed on 20 July, 1473, by William Olyver and John Hille, bailiffs of the town of Bridport, to Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, on behalf of John Wikes, chaplain, for his admission to the Chantry of St. Katherine in the parish church of Bridport, in their presentation and now vacant through the resignation of John Lugge. The second is a letter written apparently by a bailiff to his master, of which there are two drafts written on the back of the paper; the date of this is 8 Dec., 1473. The third document consists of Memoranda written on the same side as the Letters of Presentation; they are probably of about the same date as the other two. These latter documents seem to have sufficient interest of their own to justify their inclusion.

THOMAS GATE TO THOMAS STONOR [ before 1474] Thomas Gate of Brutewell (i.e. Britwell, between Farnham and Hitcham), Bucks, alias of Wycombe, was escheator of the counties of Beds and Bucks before 1467 ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Edw. IV, ii, 390; cf. Lists and Indexes , xi, 268, P.R.O.). A pedigree of Ramsey, ap. Harley MS. , 1533, f. 57, gives the descent of Thomas Ramsey from Richard Nernute. According to this pedigree Nernute had a son Myles, whose daughter Isabel married Reginald Beauchamp; the Beauchamp line of descent was Myles, Myles, John, Richard, Myles of Hicham, and Robert; Robert's daughter Isabel married Thomas Ramsey, father of the Thomas Ramsey who married Isabel Hampden, half-sister of \n  the first Thomas Stonor. The early part of this pedigree seems to be un|trustworthy. Miles de Beauchamp held Hucham or Hitcham at his death in 1336 ( Cal. Inq. , viii, 149). He was probably the husband of the daughter of Richard Nernute (or Noirnute). His heir was his grandson Miles (son of his son Richard), who held Hucham in 1346 ( Feudal Aids , i, 116). This Miles was probably the father of Robert de Beauchamp, who was great-grandfather of the Thomas Ramsey of 1474 and brother of Elizabeth, the ancestress of Thomas Gate. In 1382 Isabella (or Elizabeth) de Beauchamp held Hucham as heiress of Miles de Neirnut ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Richard II, ii, 193). Thomas Worley occurs as a servant of Edward IV in 1465 ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , Edw. IV, i, 437). The date of this letter must be earlier than 1474 and later than 1460. From A.C. , xlvi, 52.

PALMER TO [THOMAS] HAMPTON [ before 1474] Though this is not strictly a Stonor letter, and is now detached from the Collection, it may probably have been sent to Master Stonor by Hampton, and so have formed part of the Stonor Papers. Hampton is Thomas Hampton of Kimble (cf. No. 236), and \"master Stonner\" is more likely to be Thomas than William. Thus the probable date is before 1474.

HEIRLOOMS IN THE CHAPEL AND HOUSE AT STONOR [1474?] The reference to Mistress Jane suggests that this document was drawn up after the death of Thomas Stonor in 1474. The mother of Thomas Stonor \n  ( d. 1431) was also called Joan or Jane, but she had married again and died long before 1431, and is hardly likely to have been referred to as \"Mastres Jane Stonor\". On the alabaster tables, see English Medi\u00e6val Alabaster Work (Society of Antiquaries, 1913), p. 35, and Plates V and XIX; retables dealing with the Passion seem to have been characteristic of the period 1420 to 1460.

BOND BY WILLIAM STONOR TO RICHARD FOWLER 9 MAY, 1475 Richard Fowler, besides being Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was a prominent man in Oxfordshire. He was a nephew of Richard Quatermayns (see Nos. 93 and 116). Leland states that Quatermayns had \"a servant caullid Thomas Fowler, his clerk, a toward felowe that after was Chauncelor of the duchy of Lancastre,\" and was godfather to his son and \"namid hym Richard Quatermains Fowler\"; the second Richard Fowler was Quatermayns' heir, but proved \"a very onthrift and sold al his landes\" ( Itinerary , i, 115). The elder Richard Fowler was an arbitrator between William Stonor and his mother (see No. 156); he may be the \"Master Fowler\" of Nos. 71 and 174, and \"Cousin Fowler\" of Nos. 170 and 172. Quatermayns calls Thomas Stonor his cousin in No. 92. Fowler died in Nov., 1477 (Will, P.C.C., 32 Wattys). For this Bond, which has been cancelled by cutting, see Nos. 144 and 145. From Ch.

Thomas seems to have been of a jocular turn, and there may be some private jest in the use of the name. No. 153 shows that the writer had lately been in trouble, and this letter may perhaps be a little earlier in date.

WILLIAM STONOR] OCT., [?1475] In the absence of any endorsement it is impossible to be certain whether this was addressed to Thomas or to William Stonor. But the reference to John Fortescue the younger (Sir John Fortescue of Punsborne, who was a son of the elder Richard Fortescue, and died in 1500) suggests a late date. Either 1475, when St. Luke's Day was on a Wednesday, or 1476, when it was on a Friday, are possible. These dates fit with the mention of Stracchelegh in No. 279.

ELIZABETH STONOR TO WILLIAM STONOR 22 OCTOBER [1476] From the allusions it is clear that this was written shortly before the next letter; so the year is fixed for 1476, and the day was a Tuesday. \"My lady of Southfolke\" is Elizabeth of York, wife of John de la Pole, the second Duke of Suffolk. \"Cossyne Rokyse\" is presumably Thomas Rokes (see No. 89). \"My Cyster Barantyne\" is William Stonor's sister Mary, whose hus|band John Barantyne was under age (see No. 294). Elizabeth Stonor, the third sister, was apparently unmarried. John Barantyne's mother Elizabeth had married as her second husband Sir John Boteler, who died on 14 June, 1477 ( Chancery Inq. p.m., Edward IV, file 61, No. 25). As to Fowler see No. 169.

A RIOT AT FAWLEY 9 JUNE, 1477 In the Baga de Secretis , Bundle 1, m. 23 (K.B. 8, 1.) there is the record of an Inquisition held at Wycombe on 16 June, 1477, before Richard Fowler, Thomas Hampden of Hampden, John Gyfford, Richard Lovell, and Richard Maryot, justices of the peace, and justices appointed to hear and determine felonies, etc. The subject was a riot caused by William Stonor, and though not part of the Stonor Papers it seems well to give the finding of the jurors for its illustration of other matters.

JOHN CROKE TO WILLIAM STONOR [? 1477] Elizabeth Stonor had two brothers called John; the writer must be John the elder, since John the younger was apparently under age when their father died in the autumn of 1477 (between 26 Sept. and 19 Nov.). John Croke, the elder, married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Coton, Esq., of Warwick|shire (will ap. P.C.C. , 21 Logge). Since his father was still alive the date of this letter cannot be later than September, 1477. From the reference to the Fenns and Stepney it was probably not more than a year earlier than No. 213. The John Fenn of this letter is presumably the father of Stonor's wards\u2014see vol. i, p. xxix. Hugh Fenn was his cousin and overseer of his will, and is perhaps to be identified with the Hugh Fenn of the Paston Letters. From A.C. , xlvi, 92.

HENRY MAKNEY TO WILLIAM STONOR [ before 1478] Henry Makney of Makney or Mackney, near Wallingford, in Berkshire, had a lawsuit between 1467 and 1472 with John Colyngrygge. Colyngrygge and his wife Isabell, together with John FitzRobert, and his wife Agnes, pleaded that William Makney, great-grandfather ( besayll ) of Isabell and Agnes, was seised of the manor of Makney and levied a fine in 1350 entailing it on him and his wife Elyn and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to his right heirs; and that Henry Makney, son of Richard, son of William, son of the said William and Elyn, and whole brother of Isabell and Agnes, saying that he had been married 15 years and had no issue, had covenanted with Thomas Stonor, esquire, for 20 l. , part of a great sum to be paid, that the \n  manor should be made sure to Stonor and his heirs. To this Henry Makney replied that his father Richard was seised in his demesne as of fee, and so enfeoffed Sir Robert Shotebroke and others, who granted the manor to Richard and Margaret his wife. After Richard's death Margaret made an estate in a moiety of the manor to Henry for her life; she was still alive and seised of the manor, Henry not holding by the fine. He denied the alleged bargain. Colyngrygge replied asking for Makney to be bound not to defeat the fine ( Early Chancery Proceedings , 40/87-89). The litigation may have been pro|longed, but seems from these letters to have been decided in Makney's favour. This letter is earlier than 1478; it is convenient to place it here in conjunc|tion with the next two documents. From No. 192, William Stonor would seem to have acquired some right in the manor; in the Arbitrament between him and his mother he was awarded Makney's obligacion of \u00a340, whereof \u00a320 was yet due (see vol. i, p. 164 above). Leland describes Mackney as \"a pratie manor place of brike,\" builded by one Courte, \"uncle to Molines that now dwellith there\" ( Itinerary , i, 120). From A.C. , xlvi, 103.

VALUATION OF LANDS AT HENLEY [1478?] The purpose of this valuation is not clear, but it may have relation to two suits for trespass which Sir William Stonor, Richard Page, and John Matthew brought against Margaret Fyssher of Henley, widow, and Thomas Pratte of Henley, yeoman, in Trinity Term, 1478 ( Coram Rege Roll , 868, m. 43). The dispute with Pratt was as to the possession of Le Boull in the High Street of Henley, which he claimed was his own property. Pratt was accused of having broken the close of the complainants there on 10 May. There was another suit against him at the same time for breaking a close of Sir W. Stonor at Stonor on 1 May ( ibid. , Roll 869, mm. 48, 77; see also Placita de Banco , Roll 867, m. 253, Trinity 1478).

RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 7 JULY [? 1478] This letter clearly belongs to the same time as Nos. 219 and 221. Since Stonor is a knight the date cannot be earlier than 1478. Otherwise the only clue to the date is the statement in this letter that the King was to be at Windsor on 8 July, and was going thence to Nottingham. Edward IV was at Nottingham in 1478, 1481, and 1482. In 1482 he went north at the end of May\u2014see No. 313\u2014and during July was in Kent\u20143rd, Manor of Knoll, 7th and 8th, Canterbury, 9th to 18th, Dover ( Chancery Warrants , Series I, File 882). In 1481 he seems to have been at Southwell on 28th June to 5th July, and at Scrooby on 13th to 19th July ( Cal. Pat. Rolls , iii, 279-80). The Chancery Warrants (for Privy Seals) do not give clear evidence for move|ments in July, 1481, which year the evidence of the Patent Rolls makes un|likely. If the year is 1481 there is the further difficulty that Stonor must have married his third wife within two months of the death of his second. In 1478 Edward IV was at Greenwich from 2nd to 6th July, was perhaps in \n  London on the 7th and 8th, was at Ditton on 12th and 13th, Windsor on 15th to 18th, Berkhamstead on 20th, Higham Ferrers on 26th, and Notting|ham on 7th August ( Chancery Warrants , Series I, File 866). In No. 247 and all subsequent letters Page addresses Stonor as \"knight for the King's body\"; he does not do so in this letter nor in No. 221, an omission which suggests that they were earlier than 1479. So on the whole 1478 seems to be the most likely date, but the point is of no great importance. The Chamber|lain is William Hastings. From A.C. , xlvi, 186.

RICHARD BRYAN TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [29 SEPT. 1479] In his next letter Bryan gives the report of Betson's illness for Thursday, 30th Sept., and Friday, 1st October; this letter was therefore probably written on 29th Sept. Betson's uncle is perhaps Sir William Stocker, whose wife was sister to Lady Stonor. Mistress Jane is probably Jane Ryche, the younger sister of Betson's wife. Humphrey Starkey was Recorder of London \n  1471-83 ( Dict. Nat. Biog. , liv, 108). Robert Tate was sheriff in 1481-82, and mayor in 1488-89. For Richard Page see Nos. 220 and 247, and for Fenn and Fyncham see vol. i, p. xxix. The amount of money is large but compare the list of obligations due by Betson in No. 264. From A.C. , xlvi, 142. Sir, according to the commaundement of your mastership we were at Stebenhith by ix of the Clok: at suche tyme as we come thider we sawe the gentilman forthwith. And in gode feith he made us gode chere as a sike man might by countenaunce notwithstonding: for in gode feith we sawe by his demenour that he might not prospere in this world: ffor mastres Bevice and o\u00feer Gentilwomen, and his Uncle were of the same oppynyon. And we desired and praide him to be of gode comfort and so comfortid him as hertely as we coude in your name and in my ladies. And so we departid from the Chambre downe into the halle: and he felle into a grete slombering, and was besily movid in his spirites. And at a xj of the Clok I Bryan first wrote \"he\". callid his Uncle out of his bedde into the gentilman's Chambre, and I asked his advice and my maystresse his wyf of the stok and of the demenure therof for the yere and the half that is last past. And as touching the stok he confessid that it was xj. c li. iij. xx li. Wherin at the sight of your acquietaunce in discharging of him and alle his doers that shalbe be hinde him the seid stok shalbe redy.

Forther|more, as touching to John Fennys prentice alle thing is according in suerte, which shalbe delivered into the handes of Laurence Fyncham and o\u00feer of the same company. I have sent James to Page, and I trust to God he wilbe here this day by none.

[1479] This clearly relates to the stewardship of Thame. In Ancient Deeds , C. 5623, there is a copy of a grant by the dean and canons of Lincoln, at the request of Thomas, bishop of Lincoln, to Sir William Stonor and the heirs of his body, of the office of Steward of the lordships of Thame and Dorchester, in Oxfordshire, and of Wooburn and Tynghurst, Bucks., at a fee of \u00a36 1s. 8d. On the same paper is a copy of another deed dated 6 Dec., 1479. The grant of the stewardship may fairly be assigned to the same time. This letter suits well with 1479, for in that year 16th Nov. was on a Tuesday; Carnebull was going to Leicester on the following Monday, would stay there till the 26th, and then would be at Newark till 4 Dec., and at Lincoln till 12 Dec. Quatermayns and Fowler, who seem to have held the stewardship of Thame, both died in 1477. As Stonor was a knight this letter could not in any case be earlier than 1478, so that there must have been an interval between Fowler's death and Stonor's appointment. William Lenthall lived at Lachford, near Rycote\u2014see No. 297. Henry Davers was one of Fowler's executors ( P.C.C. , 32 Wattys). From A.C. , xlvi, 144.

John Wynnard died in 1468, having ap|pointed Richard Wydeslade as one of his executors and trustee for his daughter. John Wydeslade, the younger, was apparently a son of Richard, who seems to have been alive at the date of this letter (see Wynnard's will, P.C.C. , 25 Godyn, and Early Chancery Proceedings , 10/257, date 1467 to 1472. Since Elizabeth Stonor died about the end of 1479, and Agnes was married before May, 1480, this letter must have been written early in the latter year. From A.C. , xlvi, 222.

[WALTER ELMES TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR] [1480] This letter, which is unsigned and apparently intentionally obscure, seems to be in the writing of Walter Elmes, who we know from Nos. 282, 287, and 288 periodically visited Stonor's Devonshire estates. On this occasion his business would seem to have been to make arrangements for the care of Agnes Wydeslade's estates; the date is therefore probably some time in 1480; since there is no reference to the trouble at Wolveston (see Nos. 266-68) it was per|haps written in March or April. On the repairs at Clist, see No. 285. The Wydeslade mentioned in this letter is probably the father of Lady Stonor's first husband. As to Germyn see No. 268.

RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR OCTOBER [1480] The reference to All Hallow-tide shows that the month was October, and since the letter refers to the affairs of Agnes Stonor the year must be 1480. The reference to Colet points to a date later than that of No. 273. Since Lestan has ceased to be farmer of Horton, it must be later than Nos. 247 and 259.

RICHARD GERMYN TO DAME AGNES STONOR 1 MAY [1481] This was clearly written to the second Lady Stonor, and no doubt in the same year as No. 285. Agnes Stonor died on 5 May, and can never have received the letter. Her grandfather, William Wynnard, who died in 1447, founded an Almhouse at Exeter for twelve poor men, to be chosen by his heirs.

THOMAS RESTWOLD TO [SIR WILLIAM STONOR] [1480-81] This letter was no doubt addressed to Sir William Stonor, probably after the death of his first or second wife. The age (\"xxvij yere\") of the lady to \n  whom it refers would suit Agnes Wydeslade, who had more than 500 marks of land; but since she was a widow when Stonor married her, it probably does not refer to her. The age shows that it cannot refer to Anne Neville, who was only about twenty years of age when she married. Probably there|fore this letter refers to some other lady altogether.

MARY BARANTYNE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [13 NOV. 1481] John Barantyne of Little Haseley, Chalgrove and Churchill, son of Drue Barantyne by Jane, daughter of Sir John Wroughton, married Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Sir Stephen Popham. He died on 30 June, 1474 ( Chancery Inq. p.m. , Edward IV., file 50, no. 36). On 5 Aug., 1475, Richard Frebodie and others were accused of having abducted Elizabeth, widow of John Barantyne, by force from the House of the Friars Preachers in London ( Early Chancery Proceedings , 52/3). In his will (dated 28 June, 1474, proved 8 April, 1477) John Barantyne directed that his sons, John the elder, Austyn, and John the younger, and his daughter Anne, should \"be ruled and guyded by Elizabeth, my wife,\" who was to hold all his lands for life, except lands in Chalgrove purchased of Sir Richard Harcourt, and lands in Goldore called Symyuns lands, purchased of Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which John his son and heir was to have ( P.C.C. , Wattys, 34). All the children were under age; John the elder was returned as fourteen years of age and more in October, 1474. A document in Ch. Misc. , 37, iv, 20 gives particulars \"for the astate to Marie Barantyne\" which are thus summarised: \"Of Seyntcleres lond in Chalgrove, lx. s. Symeons in Goldore, lxvj. s. viij. d. And of Atyndon in the paroch. of Thame, lxxiij. s. viij. d. Summa, x. li. For my mastres Marie Barantynes joyntour.\" From No. 172 it would appear that the marriage took place before 22 Oct., 1476, when John Barantyne's widow seems to have been married to Sir John Boteler; in No. 310 it is implied that it took place before the death of John Barantyne the elder. Mary Barantyne's son William was born on 31 Dec., 1481; John Parson remembered that at his christening there was a fire in the belfry, by which the midwife stripped the child, and that Sir William Stonor, who was godfather, said the child loved it ( Cal. Inquisitions , Henry VII., ii, 6). This points to 1481 as the probable \n  year for this letter; in 1481 the feast of St. Hugh (17 Nov.) was on a Saturday. It is probable that John and Mary Barantyne were both at this time still under age and so under the control of Elizabeth Barantyne (or Boteler)\u2014see Nos. 310 and 311. In May, 1482, there was a suit brought in the Common Pleas by Thomas Danvers against John Barantyne as to the manor of Wynnale and lands in Wynnale and Henton, which was settled by the sale to Danvers on 8 May, 1482, of the manor together with lands in Wynnale, Shynnor and Henton ( Placita de Banco , Roll 880, m. 481, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2). Mary Barantyne's letter probably has reference to this transaction. John Barantyne and his mother were involved in much litigation at this time; as to \"Seynclere's lands\" in a friendly suit with Sir Richard Harcourt; and with John Nowers as to the manor of Churchill ( id. , Roll 881, mm. 296, 451, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2; see also Roll 876, mm. 443, 444 as to lands in Aston Torold and Northmorton, and the manor of Attyndon). The body of the letter and the signature are all in the same hand, which is unusually good and probably that of a professional scribe. From A.C. , xlvi, 134.

William Abell, fishmonger, of Queenhithe, was dead before the summer of 1482, when his wife Elizabeth had married again ( Placita de Banco , Roll 881, m. 528; cf. Letter Book , L., p. 214).

JOHN SHYNNER TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [? 1481] John Shynner was a Modbury man (see list in No. 71) who, as these letters show, received the living of Penton Mewsey from Sir William Stonor. Some light is thrown on this letter by Early Chancery Proceedings , 40/227, where Robert Shynner, the younger, shows that his father, Robert Shynner, the elder, was seised in his demesne as of fee of 3 messuages and 2 acres of land in \"Mychell Modbury,\" and enfeoffed John Rous, John Legh, Walter Torryng, and William Stenlake to the entent that after his death they should make an estate to the petitioner; Legh, Torryng, and Stenlake had done so, but Rous refused, and Shynner therefore prayed for a writ of sub p\u0153na. These proceedings took place between 1467 and 1472. John Shyn|ner was apparently another son of Robert Shynner, the elder. Cristina, widow of Robert Shynner, and John Shynner, as executors of Robert Shyn|ner, sued Richard Fortescue of Valepitte in Michaelmas Term, 1478, for 8 marks ( Placita de Banco , Roll 868, m. 96). John Shynner of Modbury, chaplain, had a suit for debt with Robert Tolloke ( Early Chancery Pro|ceedings , 66/86, date 1475-80).

As to Crendon see No. 239; the farm of the manor of Crendon belonged to the abbey ( Monasticon , vi, 280). From A.C. , xlvi, 184.

THOMAS BANKE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 16 JANUARY [1482] Thomas Banke was an Oxford D.D., who was Rector of Lincoln College 1493-1509, and Commissary of the University in 1501 and 1502. \"My lord Edward\" was one of the younger sons of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. In Oct., 1480, the University desired of Edward IV that he would send his nephew, \"the lord Edward Pole,\" to study at Oxford. They also asked the Bishop of Salisbury to use his influence. In March, 1481, it was reported that the Bishop would bring him there. On 28 March, 1482, the University wrote to the King praising his nephew's gifts of intellect and heart. In another letter in the same year they repeated their praise, and thanked the King \"quod Magistrum Stanley, infantem etiam nobilem atque litterarum studiosum illi prenobili nepoti tuo studiorum suorum comitem adjunxeris\". Edward de la Pole cannot have been more than fourteen when he went to Oxford. He was Archdeacon of the East Riding from 15 Oct., 1480, to 6 Jan., 1485, when he became Archdeacon of Richmond; he died not long after. (See Epistolae Academicae , ii, 454-6, 462-3, 478, 484.) Master Stanley was James, son of Thomas Stanley (afterwards Earl of Derby). He was first cousin to Sir William Stonor's third wife, Anne Neville, and was somewhat older than Edward de la Pole. He was bishop of Ely from 1506 till his death in 1515 ( Dict. Nat. Biog. , liv, 70). As to Sutton see No. 280. For Master Edmund see No. 194. The references show that the date of the letter must be either 1482 or 1483. Comparison with the reference to the troubles of Stonor's servants at Oxford in the next letter suggests that the former year is the more likely. From A.C. , xlvi, 133.

HENRY MAKNEY TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [? 29 JAN. 1482] From the mention of Clerk of Nurselyng and of the troubles of Stonor's servants at Oxford (see Nos. 303 and 305) it seems probable that the year \n  is 1482. \"Your children\" must in that case mean some wards of Stonor's. Since Stonor is a knight the date cannot be earlier than 1478; but neither that year, when 2nd Feb. was on a Monday, nor 1479, when it was on a Tuesday, are likely. In those years \"your children\" might have meant Eliza|beth Stonor's daughters, but in any later year can only mean dependent wards. From A.C. , xlvi, 178.

RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [1482] From the reference to Lady Stonor being with child the date is probably early in 1482. This letter appears to be later than No. 309 and earlier than No. 321. John Barantyne, who married Stonor's sister Mary (see No. 294), was returned as 14 years of age and more in October, 1474; at the date of this letter he seems to have been still under age, so cannot have been born before 1461; the Inquisition is quite possibly inaccurate. \"Lady Botiller\" is his mother, who married as her second husband Sir John Boteler; she is called \"my lady Barantyne\" in the next letter. The Barantyne manor of Chalgrove was held in part of the Prince of Wales as of the manor of Wal|lingford ( Chancery Inq. p.m. Edward IV., file 50, no. 36); hence the refer|ence in these letters to the ravishment of his ward.

MOLEYNS TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [1482] This apparently refers to the same matter as the previous letter, and is therefore to be dated early in 1482. \"My lady Barantyne\" no doubt means Elizabeth, Lady Boteler, John Barantyne's mother.

SIMON STALLWORTH TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 1 MAY [1482?] Stallworth's other letters (Nos. 330 and 331) to Sir W.

Stallworth was afterwards sub-dean of Lincoln, and pre|bendary of St. Stephen, Westminster; he died in 1511 (will ap. P.C.C. , 21 Fetiplace). As to Christopher Holand, see No. 283.

HUGH UNTON TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [11 MAY, 1482] From the reference to the King's going northwards, the date would seem to be May, 1482. Edward went to Fotheringhay about the end of May in that year (Ramsay, Lancaster and York , ii, 443). The intended date given in this letter is Whit-Tuesday, i.e. 28 May. The probable date for the letter itself is therefore Saturday, 11 May. As to the Worthe lawsuit, see Nos. 266-8, and 272. There is no reference to it in the \"De Banco\" Rolls for Easter and Trinity terms, 1482. Nor in the corresponding Rolls for 1480 or 1481. There is, however, a record in Easter term of a successful suit brought by Worthe against Humphrey Veysy claiming messuages and lands in Crowthorne and Kynecote Hille, as heir of Agnes, daughter of John Wynnard; these lands had descended to her from John and Agnes Bevyle ( Placita de Banco , Roll 880, mm. 447, 448; see also Coram Rege , Rolls 868, m. 141, and 869, m. 98; Trinity and Michaelmas terms, 1478, as to Elizabeth, wife of Thomas Worth, and Agnes, wife of John Wydeslade, heiresses of Humphrey Bevyle). In Trinity term, 1482, Sir \n  William Stonor had suits against Henry Felowe of Huchynden, Oxfordshire, and John Barell of Princes Risborough for trespass, and against Robert Emond of Hembury also for trespass ( Placita de Banco , Roll 881, mm. 71, 197). His \"mater anendes the Qwene\" is explained by a suit which was pending against him for payment of 1000 marks under a bond dated 20th February, 1477 ( id . Roll 881, m. 431). This suit which was already threatened in 1481 ( id . Roll 877, m. 26) was then postponed to Michaelmas and finally to Hilary Term, 1483, see also Nos. 319 and 320. Sir Thomas Bryan was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1471 to 1500. From A.C. , xlvi, 218. Right worshipfull Maister, I recommaunde me unto you.

MARMION 20 DEC. 1482 Apart from its genealogical details the interest of this document consists chiefly in its relation to Ancient Deeds , C. 2747 and C. 2320\u2014see p. 175 below. The original is only a rough draft. The dispute seems to have originated in the purchase by Sir William Stonor (in 1479) from Peter Mar|myon of the manor of Beamys with manors, lands, and tenements in Shenyng|feld, Swalowefeld, Farley, Sydenham, Tronkewell, Foxhill, and Sheperygge in Berks. and Wilts, and of the manor of Nustelyngis in Hampshire. Part of the consideration was the grant by Stonor of an annual rent of 5 marks for life from Horton to Eleanor, wife of Peter Marmyon. There were similar grants of 100 s . to Robert, and of 40 s . each to John and Peter, sons of Peter Mar|myon (see Ch. Misc. , 37, ix, 40). The \"Requests\" here given come from Ch. Misc. , 37, v, 13.

SIMON STALLWORTH TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 21 JUNE, 1483 Printed in Excerpta Historica , pp. 16, 17. The greater part of the letter, down to \"menne of my lord,\" is not in Stallworth's writing. Sir Clements Markham ( Life of Richard III , p. 214) has argued that: \"As Saturday was the 21st, Friday last was the 20th. We have here evidence that Lord Hastings was not beheaded until a week after his arrest. . . . The story of Morton about the hurried execution on the 13th, and the log of wood, is there|fore false.\" Dr. Gairdner ( Eng. Hist. Review , vi, 454) contested this con|clusion. But the fact that the letter was written in two hands affords an easy explanation; the first part may well have been written on Friday, the 20th, and the end added by Stallworth on the Saturday. This also explains the \n  change of Stallworth's opinion as to the likelihood of the early release of the bishops. Compare, however, the dating of No. 174 on \"All Soules dai last past\". From A.C. , xlvi, 207. Worschipfull Sir, I commend me to you, and for tydynges I hold you happy that ye ar oute of the prese, for with huse is myche trobull, and every manne dowtes other.
