[A.D. 1400] [ Digby 102, leaf 98.] [21 stanzas of 8, abab bcbc .] (1) Eche man be war, that bereth a state, Of counseil of double entendement, Of tyrauntrye, and preuey hate, And synguler profit by fals assent, And &yogh;ong to &yogh;yue Iugement. In Euenhede, Lawe &yogh;e lede. Worche be good auisement. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (2) \u00b6 Drede god, and knowe thy selue, That ouer puple hast gouernaunce. Noght for the loue of ten or twelue, Brynge not a Comone in greuaunce. Make vnyte ther was distaunce. Weye o lawe in euenhede, Bytwen ffauour and vengeaunce. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (3) \u00b6 Eche mannys gouernours Of hous or lordshipe or cite, The puple is godes, and not &yogh;oures, Thow they be soget to &yogh;oure degre. Gouerne the puple in vnyte, In the comaundements that god bede, And &yogh;e wole lyue in charite. Knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (4) \u00b6 Eche man wot, that hath wyt, These worldes goodes beth not his. Alle is godes; he oweth hit, And land and see, and pyne and blis. God wole haue rekenyng, ywys, Of men and cloth, the leste shrede, Thy getyng, thy holding, thy spendyng mys. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (5) \u00b6 Man of his owen hath no thyng; Man is goddis, and al god sent. God wole haue rekenyng Of ryht and wrong, how it is went. Man, not nys thyn, alle god lent, And borwed thyng mot home ful nede; And &yogh;ut thy soule is goddis rent: Quyte that wele in loue and drede. (6) \u00b6 Serue god for helle drede, ffle fro synne and al vys. And &yogh;e loue god for heuen mede, &YOGH;yue hym thyn hert fro fleschly delys. ffor worldly wys is gostly nys, And fooles erande may not spede. In begynnyng to be wys Knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (7) \u00b6 And &yogh;e wole wyte, thus mowe &yogh;e lere: What man pursueth his soule to saue, &YOGH;if hym be lef of god to here, He ableth hym self mercy to haue. Richesse and hele maketh wylde men raue, That to vertues take non hede. Er thy soule be fendes knaue, Knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (8) \u00b6 That man that wole be gouerned by wyt, ffle fro foly, and worldis delys; Loke his charge how it is knyt, And take counseil that is wys; ffolwe mesure in euene syse; Lete no falshed blome ne sede. And lawe be kept, no folk nyl ryse. Than seruest god in loue and drede. (9) \u00b6 Whanne a fool stereth a barge, Hym self and al the folke is shent. There as conscience is large, By wrath or mede the doom is went. The bowe of goddis wrath is bent On hem that deth not that god bede. War wordes of dowble entendement, Knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (10) \u00b6 Gif a kyngdom falle a chaunce That al the rewme myght greue, A&yogh;en that make an ordinaunce, To kepe &yogh;ow euere fro suche myscheue; And chastise hem that matere meue: Make othere take ensaumple treuth to hede. Who so is wys, his werkys preue. Loue god, and &yogh;e thar not drede. (11) \u00b6 Goddis bowe of wratthe on vs was bent; There we thenke al to lyte. His &yogh;erde of loue on summe is lent, With swerd of vengeaunce he summe doth smyte. The brydell with teeth thay byte That of god taken non hede. Or fendys alle &yogh;oure werkys wryte, Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (12) \u00b6 Why pore men don riche reuerence, Two skylles y fynde therfore: To tyrauntes don hem greuaunce, To rewe and a&yogh;en restore. Goode men for loue they worshipe more, That don hem good, and help at nede; ffor god seeth thurgh euery bore. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (13) \u00b6 Eche man wot, that bereth estate, Why they hit resceyue, and to what wyse. Worship for drede is preue hate; Suche worship of frendes men schold refuyse. In loue and drede worshipe the wyse. Be suget to resoun in lengthe and brede, ffor god seeth thurgh eche mysse. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (14) \u00b6 As long as man doth wrong, He maketh god his ful foo; The more he dwelleth theryn long, To his soule he encreseth woo. Er he fele het, y rede say hoo, Er his soule glowe as glede. Haue heuene, or helle: chese of two. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (15) \u00b6 The man withoute charitee May neuere wynne heuen blisse. As thou wolde men dede for the, Do thou so liche eche man haue hisse; ffor all that euere is goten mysse, Mot be rekened, a drope &yogh;e shede. Thes worldis good and thou mon kysse. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (16) \u00b6 ffalse men bye helle ful dere. That taken with wrong, are goddis theues; They han here heuene in this world here; After in helle, huge myscheues. What they byleue, here werkys preues Arn heretikes, and out of the Crede. Why god doth loue, why god doth greues, Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (17) \u00b6 Man, synne not in ouerhope; Thou wynnest not goddis mercie with fight; Hit wolde brynge the in wanhope, To wene no mercy thou hauen myght. Alle thyng is nombred in goddis sight, The leste tryp that euere &yogh;e trede. His mercy is medled with his right. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (18) \u00b6 Mannes conscience wil hym telle, Riche and pore, fool and wyse, Whether he be worthi heuene or helle To resceyue, after his seruyce. Eche man auyse hym, that is wys, Pore, and prynce styf on stede, Or vyces ouer vertues rys. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (19) \u00b6 Who that take\u00fe fro pore to eke with his, ffor that wrong is worthy wo; A-nother, richer than he is, Of the same shal serue hym so. That &yogh;eueth to that li&yogh;e or go, Mete or drynke, herborwe or wede, God sendes y-now to tho That louen god, and hym wolen drede. (20) \u00b6 He is a fool, that doth answere To a man er tale be told; But after the dede deme there; Lete not lawe be fauoured ne sold. Suche maken fals men be bold, And false men myghte stroye a thede. Er charitee in hert wexe cold, Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede. (21) \u00b6 &YOGH;if a man do a-nother mys, Neighbores shuld hem auyse, The trespasour amende and kys, Do bothe parties euene assise. Old horded hate maketh wratthe to rise, And ofte gilteles blod to blede. ffle fro fooles, and folwe wise. Man, knowe thy self, loue god, and drede.", "1": "II. Mede and muche thank. [ Digby 102, leaf 99, back .] [11 stanzas of 8, abab bcbc .] (1) IN blossemed buske I bode boote, In ryche array, with ryches rank, ffaire floures vnder foote, Sauour to myn herte sank. I sawe two buyrnes on a bank. To here talkyng I tok hede. That on preysede moche thank, That other held al with mede. (2) \u00b6 That on, a trauaylyng man had ben, He was but in mene array; That other clothed in gawdy gren, Blasande bri&yogh;t, embrowdid gay. \"Loo, felow, chese y may To ryde on palfray or on stede.

Thou getest the thonke with spere and launce, Ther-with thou might the clothe and fede; I gloser wil stonde to my chaunce, And mayntene my men al with mede.

[Early in 1401] [ Digby 102, leaf 100.] [21 stanzas of 8, abab, bcbc .] (1) FOr drede ofte my lippes y steke, ffor false reportours, that trouhte mys-famed. &YOGH;ut Charitee chargeth me to speke. \u00deou&yogh; trou\u00fee be dred, he nys not ashamed. Trou\u00fee seche\u00fe non hernes ther los is lamed; Trou\u00fee is worschiped at euery des. In that kyngdom ther trou\u00fee is blamed, God sendes vengeaunce to make trou\u00fee haue pes. (2) \u00b6 Trou\u00fee is messager to ry&yogh;t, And ry&yogh;t is counseille to Iustice; Iustice in goddis stede is dy&yogh;t. Do euene lawe to fooll and wyse. Set mesure in euene assise, The ri&yogh;te weye as lawe ges. And lawe be kept, folk nyl not ryse. That kyngdom shal haue reste and pes. (3) \u00b6 &YOGH;if suche a tale-tellere were, To a kyng apayre a mannys name, The kyng shulde bo\u00fee partyes here, And punysche \u00fee fals for defame. \u00dean fals men wolde ases for blame; ffor falshed, body and soule it sles. ffalshed endes ay in shame; And trou\u00fee, in worschipe and in pes. (4) \u00b6 Whanne lawe is put fro ri&yogh;t assise, And domes man made by mede, ffor fawte of lawe &yogh;if comouns rise, \u00dean is a kyngdom most in drede. ffor whanne vengeaunce a comouns lede, \u00deei do gret harm er \u00feey asses. There no man o\u00feer do\u00fe mysbede, That kyngdom shal haue reste and pes. (5) \u00b6 Whan craft rise\u00fe a&yogh;ens craft, In burgh, toun, or citee, \u00deey go to lordes whan lawe is laft, Whoche party may strengere be. But wyse men \u00fee sonere se By witles wille \u00feey gedre pres, Or lordis medle in foly degre, Let lawe haue cours in reste and pes. (6) \u00b6 &YOGH;it \u00feere is \u00fee \u00feridde distaunce Brynge\u00fe a kyngdom in moche noy&yogh;e: Ofte chaunge of gouernaunce Of all degre, lowe and hy&yogh;e. A kyng may not al aspie. Summe telle hym so\u00fe, summe telle hym les. \u00dee whete fro \u00fee chaf &yogh;e try&yogh;e, So mowe &yogh;e leue in reste and pes. (7) \u00b6 I speke not in specyale Of oo kyngdom the lawe to telle; I speke hool in generale In eche kyngdom the lawe to telle. Also is writen in \u00fee gospelle A word \u00feat god hym-seluen ches: Ra\u00feere \u00fean fi&yogh;te, a man go selle On of his clo\u00fees, and bi&yogh;e hym pes. (8) \u00b6 A wor\u00fei kny&yogh;t wol worchip wynne; He wil not &yogh;elde hym \u00feou&yogh; me \u00feret, But ra\u00feere as Malice do\u00fe begynne, Quenche hit at \u00fee firste het. ffor, and &yogh;e lete it growe gret, Hit brenne\u00fe breme as fyre in gres. Laweles nouellerye loke &yogh;e lete, So mowe &yogh;e lyue in reste and pes. (9) \u00b6 Old speche is spoken &yogh;ore: What is a kyngdom tresory? Bestayle, corn stuffed in store, Riche comouns, and wyse clergy; Marchaundes, squyers, chiualry That wol be redy at a res, And cheualrous kyng in wittes hy&yogh;e, To lede in were, and gouerne in pes. (10) \u00b6 Among philosofres wyse, In here bokes, men writen fynde \u00deat synne is cause of cowardyse; Wel lyuyng man, hardy of kynde; Wikked lyuere, graceles blynde; He drede\u00fe de\u00fe, \u00fee laste mes. \u00dee good lyuere ha\u00fe god in mynde; \u00deat mannys counseil make\u00fe pes. (11) \u00b6 What kyng that wol haue good name, He wol be lad by wys counsayle \u00deat loue worschip, and dreden shame, And boldely dar fende and assayle. \u00deere wit is, corage may not fayle, ffor wysdom neuere worschip les. Corage in querell do\u00fe batayle, And ende of batayle bygynne\u00fe pes. (12) \u00b6 Defaute of wit make\u00fe long counsayle; ffor witteles wordes in ydel spoken, \u00dee more cost, \u00fee lesse auayle; ffor fawte of wyt, purpos broken. In euyl soule no grace is stoken, ffor wikked soule is graceles. [nota] In good lyuere goddis wille is loken, \u00deat mannys counsell make\u00fe pes. (13) \u00b6 To wete &yogh;if parlement be wys, \u00dee comoun profit wel it preues. A kyngdom in comouns lys, Alle profytes, and alle myscheues. Lordis wet neuere what comouns greues Til here rentis bigynne to ses. \u00deere lordis ere, pore comons releues, And mayntene hem in werre and pes. (14) \u00b6 Make god &yogh;oure ful frend; Do \u00fee comaundement \u00feat he bede. \u00deou&yogh; all \u00fee world a&yogh;en &yogh;ow wend, Be god &yogh;oure frend, &yogh;e thar not drede: ffor \u00feere as god his frendis lede, He saue\u00fe hem bo\u00fee on lond and sees. Who so fi&yogh;te\u00fe, god do\u00fe \u00fee dede, ffor god is victorie and pes. (15) \u00b6 What kyngdom werre\u00fe hym-self wi\u00fe-ynne, Distroye\u00fe hym-self, and no mo. Wi\u00fe-oute here enemys bygynne On eche a syde assayle hem so. \u00dee comouns, \u00feey wil robbe and slo, Make fyere, and kyndel stres. Whan ryches and manhode is wastede and go, \u00dean drede dryue\u00fe to trete pes. (16) \u00b6 The world is like a fals lemman, ffayre semblaunt, and moche gyle. Wi\u00feouten heire dye\u00fe no man: God is chief lord of toun and pyle. God make\u00fe mony heire in a whyle, ffor god ressayue\u00fe eche reles; God kan breke hegge and style, And make an hey wey to pes. (17) \u00b6 God made lordis gouernoures To gouerne puple in vnyte. \u00dee puple, ne ryches, nys not &yogh;oures: Al is goddis, and so be &yogh;e. Eche day &yogh;e may &yogh;oure myrrour se. Eche man after o\u00feer deses; &YOGH;oure auncetres arn gon, after shal &yogh;e, To endeles werre, or endeless pes. (18) \u00b6 Eche kyng is sworn to gouernaunce To gouerne goddis puple in ri&yogh;t. Eche kyng bere\u00fe swerd of goddis vengeaunce To felle goddis foon in fi&yogh;t. And so do\u00fe euerons honest kny&yogh;t That bere\u00fe \u00fee ordre as it wes; The plough, \u00fee chirche, to mayntene ry&yogh;t, Are goddis champyons, to kepe \u00fee pes. (19) \u00b6 The world is like a chery fayre, Ofte chaunge\u00fe all his \u00feynges. Riche, pore, foul, and fayre, Popes, prelates and lordynges, Alle are dedly, and so ben kynges; Or de\u00fe lede &yogh;ow in his les, Arraye by tyme &yogh;oure rekenynges, And trete wi\u00fe god to gete &yogh;ow pes. (20) \u00b6 What brynge\u00fe a kyngdom al aboue? Wys counseil, and good gouernaunce; Eche lord wil other loue, And rule wel labourrers sustynaunce. God make\u00fe for his frendis no destaunce, ffor god kan skatre \u00fee grete pres. God for his frendis ma\u00fe ordynaunce, And gouerne\u00fe hem in werre and pes. (21) \u00b6 Good lyf is cause of good name; Good name is worthi to haue reueraunce. . . . . . Synne is cause of greuaunce. Eche kyngdom honge\u00fe in goddis balaunce; Wi\u00fe hym \u00feat holde\u00fe, wi\u00fe hym \u00feat fles. &YOGH;e haue fre wille; chese &yogh;oure chaunce, To haue wi\u00fe god, werre or pes.", "3": "IV.

[ Douce MS. 322, At the beginning, a coat of arms painted: gules, a chevron azure, between three garbs or, 2 and 1. leaf 10.] [57 stanzas of 12, abab, abab , and baba or bcbc , with Latin subjects.] Here begynneth the nyne lessons of the Dirige whych Job made in hys tribulacion, lying on the Donghyll, and ben declared more opynly to lewde \n  mennes vnderstanding by a solempne, worthy, and dis|crete clerke, Rychard Hampole , and ys cleped pety Job, and ys full profitable to stere synners to compunccion. (1) Parce michi, domine, nichil enim sunt dies mei. Lyef lord, my soule thow spare, The sothe I sey now sykerly, That my dayes nought they are; ffor though I be bryght of ble, The fayrest man that ys oughware, Yet shall my fayrenesse fade and fle, And I shalbe wormes ware. . . . . . no gap in the MS. And when my body ys all bare, And on a bere brought shal be, I nat what I may synge thare But Parce michi, domine. (2) Quid est homo, quia magnificas eum? What ys a man, wete I wolde, That magnifyeth hymself alway, But a marke, made in molde, Of a clyngyng clot of clay? Thow shopest vs for that we shulde Haue ben in blysse for euer and ay; But nowe, allas, bothe yong and olde fforyety\u00f1 hit bothe nyght and day. A, good lord, what shall I say, I that stande in thys degre? I wote nothyng that helpe may But Parce michi, domine. (3) Aut quid opponis erga eum cor tuum, visitas eum diliculo, et subito probas illum? Or why puttist thow thyn hert ayenst man That thow hast so dere bought? Thow vysyteste hym, and art full fayne Sodenly to preue yef he be ought. To longe in synne we haue layne; ffor synne hath so oure soule thorow sought, To helpe oureself haue we no mayne, So moche woo hit hath vs wrought. But to the pyt when we be brought, Then men woll wepe for the and me. But certes all that helpeth nought But Parce michi, domine. (4) Vsquequo non parcis michi nec dimittas me vt gluciam saliuam meam? peccaui. Or why so longe or thow wolt spare Me in synne that depe dyue? Thow woldest suffer neuer more Me to swolowe my salyue? I haue the gylt, and greuyd sore, ffor synne with me hathe ben to ryue. But, lord, now lere me with thy lore That dedly synne fro me may dryue. And Ihesu, for thy woundes fyue, As thow becammest man for me, When I shall passe oute of lyue, Than Parce michi, domine. (5) Quid faciam tibi, o custos hominum? quare posuisti me contrarium tibi, et factus sum michimet ipsi grauis? What shall I do vn-to the, O thow kepar of all mankynde? Of suche a matiere why madest thow me, To the contrarious me for to fynde? O fader of heuen, fayre and fre, As thow art bothe good and hende, Yet be kynde as thow hast be, And spare me, lorde, that am vnkynde. Thy frenshyp, fader, late me fynde, As thow art god in trinite. Of thy mercy make me haue mynde Wyth Parce michi, domine. (6) Cur non tollis peccatum meum, et quare non aufers iniquitatem meam? Why takest thow nat my syn away, A, thow god of all goodnesse? And why also, as I the say, Dost nat awey my wykednesse? Thow madest me of a clot of clay, That breketh ofte thorough brotylnesse. ffull brotyll I am, hit ys no nay; That maketh me ofte to do amysse. But good Ihesu, I pray thys ffor thy grete benygnyte: Thy mercy, lorde, late me nat mys, But Parce michi, domine. (7) Ecce, nunc in puluere dormio; et si mane me quesieris, non subsistam. Loo, in pouder I shall slepe, ffor owte of poudere furst I cam, And into poudere must I crepe, ffor of that same kynde I am. That I ne am pouder I may not threpe, ffor erthe I am, as was Adam; And nowe my pytte ys doluen depe. Though men me seke, ryght nought I am. O thow, fader Abraham, ffor Mary loue, that mayde so fre, In whos blode thy son swamme, So Parce michi, domine. (8) TEdet animam meam vite mee; dimittam aduer|sum me eloquium meum; loquar in amari|tudine amime mee; dicam deo, \"noli me condempnare; indica michi cur me ita iudices.\" Hyt forthynketh my soule y-wys, The lyfe that I haue lad alway; ffor now my speche ayenst me ys, Sothly my lyfe I shall dysplay. In sorow and in bytternesse Of myn oune soule, thus shall I say: Now, good Ihesu, kynge of blysse, Dampne me nat at domesday. And, good Ihesu, to the I pray, Telle how thus thow demest me. Nowe yeue me mercy, and say nat nay, Wyth Parce michi, domine . (9) Nunquid tibi bonum videtur si calumpnieris et oprimas me, opus manuum tuarum, et consilium impiorum adiuues? Semeth hit good, lorde, vnto the, To thryste me doune, and me accuse? I am thy werke, thow madest me: Thyne oune handwerk thow nat refuse. Wythyn the close of cheryte, Good god, thow me recluse, And yef I gylte the in any degre, With thy mercy thow me excuse, Ne late me neuer of maters muse That fallen vnto dyshoneste. Thys prayer thow nat recuse, But Parce michi, domine . (10) Nunquid oculi carnei tibi sunt aut sicut videt homo et tu vides? Whether thyne eyen flesshly be, Or yef thow seest as seeth a man? Nay, forsooth, but oonly we Of outeward thynges beholdyng han; But inward thynges dost thow se, That non other may se ne can; Therfore, lorde, I pray to the, Warne me when I am mystan, That I may flee fro foule sathan, That ys aboute to perysshe me. Lese nat thow ones wan, But Parce michi, domine . (11) Nunquid sicut dies hominis dies tui et anni tui sicut humana sunt tempora? Whether thy dayes, lord, be syke As mennys dayes, that dwellen here, Or thy yeres be ought lyke To the tymes of mannes yere? That day a man ys fresshe and fryke, And sheweth forth a gladsom chere; But to-morow he wexeth syke, And haply borne forthe on a bere. Thus mannes tyme ys in a were; But thy tyme stondeth in oo degre. Therfore, I pray in thys manere: Lorde, Parce michi, domine . (12) Vt queras iniquitatem meam, et peccatum meum scruteris, et scias quia nichil impium fecerim, cum sit nemo qui de manu tua possit eruere. ffor to seche my wyckednesse, And for suche thus all my synne, Me thynketh hit commeth of grete hardnes, With me, lorde, so to begynne. Shewe thow forth thy grete goodnes, And thyne hardshyp vp thow pynne. Thynke opon the brytylnesse That alwey worcheth me withynne. And sythen I may nat fro the twyn, Ne from thyne hande warysshed be, Though I offende more or mynne, Euer Parce michi, domine . (13) Manus tue fecerunt me, et plasmauerunt me totum in circuitu, et sic repente precipitas me. Thyne handes, lorde, haue made me, And formed me in shape of man, And me thow settest in degre Of grete nobley after than. But whan I, thorough the sotylte, Deceyued was of foule sathan, Thow puttedyst me fro that dignite, Heldyng doune on my brayn pan. Noon other cause alege I can, But that synne hathe depryued me. Now, for the blood that from the ranne, So Parce michi, domine . (14) Memento, queso, quod sicut lutum feceris me, et in puluerem reduces me. Haue mynde, therfore, I the pray, O thow god, almyghty kynge. Thynke thow madest me of clay, And in-to clay thow shalt me brynge. Suche ys thy myght, and hath be ay. And sythen thow madest furst all thynge, Who dare sey ayene the nay, To lette thy wyll or thy lykyng? There ys man olde ne yonge That stryue dar ayenst the. Therfore, nede maketh me synge, Lorde, Parce michi, domine . (15) Nonne sicut lac mulsisti me, et sicut caseum me coagulasti? Mylkedest nat me, lorde, as mylke, With nesshe blood whan thow me made? And sythen, lord, that ylke, Ryght as the hardnesse of chese ys hade? My bloode ys nessher than ys sylke, In reyny weder that sone woll fade, And thus me made do dedys swylke With whyche my goste ys ofte vnglade. And thus in sinne full depe I wade, That nygh I droune thorow freelte. Although I can of synne nat sade, Yet Parce michi, domine . (16) Pelle et carnibus vestisti me, ossibus et neruis compegisti me. With flesshe and felle thow hast me cladde, With bones and synewes togeder knyt. Lyfe and mercy of the I hadde. To gouerne me thow yaue me wyt. To kepe thyne hestes thow me bade, And seydest that I shuld, for hit, In heuen blysse be euer gladde; And yet I woll nat fro syn flytte, But freelte, lord, so me smytte, Vnnethe kepte ys oone for me. Nat for than I pray the yet ffor Parce michi, domine. (17) Vitam et misericordiam tribuisti michi. Lyfe and mercy thow yaue me ay. When I wold thy mercy craue, Thow seydest to me nat ones nay, But glad was when I wold hit haue. Thow were redy nyght and day With mercy, lord, me to saue; But I denyed hit alwey, So woodly syn made me to raue. I seruyd syn, and was hys knaue. I dyd that was ayenst me. Now, lord, when I am leyde in graue, Than Parce michi, domine. (18) Et visitacio tua custodivit spiritum meum. Thy vysitacion, lorde, hath kepte My spyryte, that ys me withyn. ffor when I wolde to syn haue lepte, Than holy grace made me to blyn. And ofte tyme I haue sore wept, The more grace of the to wyn. And thus with wepyng haue I wypt My soule, lord, from dedly synne. Lord, late me neuer werke begynne That in any wyse may displese the; And, som tyme though I fro the twyn, Yet, lord, Parce michi, domine. (19) Quantas habeo iniquitates et peccata, scelera mea atque delicta ostende michi. What wykednes all that I haue, With my synnes all on an hepe, Shewe me hem, or I go to graue, That I for hem may sore wepe; My soule, lord, that I may saue ffrom the pyt of hell so depe, Where synful soules tumble and raue, In endeles woo ataketh good kepe. Toodes of hem doth crowde and crepe, In suche peynes the soules be. ffrom that place I may nat kepe Withouten Parce michi, domine. (20) Cur faciem tuam abscondis, et arbitraris me inimi|cum tuum? Why hydest thow fro me thy face That ys so full of all fayrenesse? I mene thys somtyme thy grace, That thow withdrawest and yeuest me lace. As thyne enemy thow dost me chace, Demyng me in grete hardnesse. Thy loue fayne wold I purchase Yef thow wolt me hit graunte of thy goodnes. Now graunte me, lord, suche stedfastnes, That I may stande in oo degre, And though I fall thorow brotylnes, Lorde, Parce michi, domine. (21) Contra folium quod vento rapitur, ostendis poten|ciam tuam, et stipulam siccam persequeris. Ayenst a leefe, that lyght ys to blowe, To me that am freel of kynde, Thy myght and power dost thow showe, As though I myght beres bynde. With wyndes ofte I ouerthrowe, Suche fondyng of the I fynde. I renne forthe fro rowe to rowe, Som-tyme before, somtyme behynde. I grope as a man that ys full blynde; But though I stomble, thow folowest me. A, lord, though I to the be vnkynde, Yet Parce michi, domine! (22) Scribis enim contra me amaritudines, et consumere me vis peccatis adolescencie mee. Thow wrytest, lord, ayenst me Bytternesse, that I shall rede, At domesday, in syght of the, And all the worlde in length and brede. That I dyd in pryuyte, There opynly hit owte shall sprede; And thys thow wylt full well y-se, And distroy me for my wyked dede. But, lorde, to the I clepe and grede, As thow art lorde of all pyte, That day when I shall drope and drede, Than Parce michi, domine! (23) Posuisti in neruo pedem meum, et obseruasti omnes semitas meas, et vestigia pedum meorum con|siderasti. In a synew thow hast my feet sette, With the whyche that I go shall, And all the pathes thow hast mette That euer I yede in wey or walle. There ys nothyng that the may lette To knowe my steppes grete and smalle, Wycked and worse, good and bette, I wote well thow considerest alle. But, lorde, to the I clepe and calle; When I slyde, supporte thow me; And though somtyme I take a falle, Yet Parce michi, domine! (24) Qui quasi putredo consumendus sum, et quasi vestimentum, quod commeditur a tinea. The whyche as rotyng shall consume, And fare as mowthe eten cloth; And as from the fyre departeth fume, So body and soule asundre goth. I am made of a lothly hume; Hit ys a thyng to man most loth. Wherof than shulde I presume To be hygh-herted or lyghtly wroth? Though I be he that ofte mys doth, Of mercy art thow large and fre. As I leue that thys ys soth, So Parce michi, domine! (25) HOmo natus de muliere, breui viuens tempore, repletur multis miserijs, A man that ys of a woman bore, But lytell whyle he lyueth here, And euery day more and more Replenysshed ys with synnes sere; With hote and colde, and hungor sore, Turmented ys from yere to yere, And ofte hym wanteth goddys lore, That gostly wey, he shuld lere. And thus he wandreth in a were, As a man blynde, and may nat se. Therfore I pray the, with louely chere, ffor Parce michi, domine! (26) Qui quasi flos egreditur et conteritur, et fugit velud vmbra, et nunquam in eodem statu permanet. The whyche spryngeth oute as a floure, That groweth fresshe, all men to glade; But when he with a sharpe shoure Ys smyten, begynneth sone to fade. So lese I the fayre coloure That god almyghty furst in me made, And thus I chaunge in euery shoure, And fle away ryght as a shade. And herewith I am full lade With synnes of diuerse degre. Of heuen blysse me nought degrade, But Parce michi, domine! (27) Et dignum ducis super huiuscemodi aperire oculos tuos, et adducere eum tecum in iudicium. And, lord, thow lettest that hit be dygne Thyne eyen to opene vppon suche on, And hym thow shewest, by that sygne, That he, with the, to dome shall gone. Haue mercy on me, Ihesu benygne! Me thynketh myn hert ys harder than a ston, And besyed with a spiryte maligne. My flesshe, the worlde, then ben my fone. These ben myn enemyes, lord, echone, Euer aboute to perysshe me. Lorde, for the loue of Mary and Iohn Euer Parce michi, domine! (28) Quis potest mundum de immundo conceptum semine? nonne tu, qui solus es? But, lord, who may clene make Conceyued thyng of seede vnclene? Nat thow? A, yes, I vnderstande, Yef the lyste to make hit clene. Allas, I walke in a lake Of dedly synne that doth me tene. But, lorde, for the loue of Maryes sake, Amende the harme that I of mene. Y-wys I am nat worthe a bene, Of my sylfe, to commendyd be. Yet helpe me, lorde, with thy grace shene, And euer Parce michi, domine! (29) Breues dies hominis sunt, numerus mensium eius apud te est. Mennes dayes ben shorte, beware, And therto take good entente; ffor in respyte of tyme euermare They beth nothyng equipolent. The nombre of hys monthes are Alwey at the, lorde, verament. Oure lyfe ys nought but sorow and care Tyll we be passed iugement. My wyttes, lorde, I haue myspent, That thow me yaue to rewle with me. But that I may ryse vp, and here repent, Lorde, Parce michi, domine! (30) Constituisti terminos eius, qui preteriri non pote|runt. Hys termes, lord, thow hast ordeyned, How longe he shall now lyue here; That may he nat passe, ne be refreyned, But by thyne absolute power. Thys sentence may be well susteyned By a story, as we may here, Howe Ezechye to deth-ward peyned, And yet god addyd ouer xv yere. Hys kyndly tyme was comen full nere, But for hys synnes tho wepte he. Lorde, yeue me grace, that I may here Haue Parce michi, domine! (31) Recede ergo paululum ab eo, vt quiescat, donec optata veniat, et sicut mercenarij dies eius. Therfore, lord, a lytell go awey. Withdrawe thyn hande, that man may rest Tyll he desyre hys dethe day, And wylne to be shut vp in hys cheste, And late hym lyue, yef hym lust ay. Thys holde I, lorde, for the beste. All disease from hym delay Tyll the careyn in erthe be keste. Allas, all thys world now ys myswrest, To carpe thys, lorde, ayenst the. Make me to thy mercy trest, ffor Parce michi, domine!

But woldest thow, lorde, me vnbynde Thorough the vertew of thy pyte, Than were I glad, and lyght as lynde, To haue Parce michi, domine . (34) Putasne mortuus homo rursum viuat? Trowest thow nat that man shal ryse Ayene to lyfe, that dyed onys? Yes, and that in a wonderful wyse, With flesshe and felle, bloode and bones. Than shal god hys dome deuyse, And to hym take the good att ones; But dampned soules shullen sore gryse, And yeue a shoute with hydous grones. Thys make they shull wofull mones; All that shullen dampned be, That I may dwelle withyn the wones Of Parce michi, domine! (35) Cunctis diebus quibus nunc milito, expecto donec veniat immutacio mea.

But, good Ihesu, to the I pray, Thynke alwey with full entent Thow madest me of a clot of clay; Thyne handwerke helpe, as thow furst ment; And with my thought I haue myspent, Thorough malyce, here, of frealte: Here, leof lorde, late me repente, But Parce michi, domine!

Whan I am closed in that cage, Than Parce michi, domine! (39) Non peccaui, et in amaritudinibus moratur oculus meus. I haue nat synned wylfully Thorow my feynt, feble nature, Ne greued the so greuosly, Wherfore I shulde thys wo endure. Thow punysshest me, and I not why, Passing resoun and good mesure. Hit ys my flessh, lorde, and nat I, That grocheth ayenst thyn hard reddure. But, lorde, as I am thy creature, And that ylke god that boughtest me, So my care recouere and cure With Parce michi, domine! (40) Dies mei transierunt, cogitaciones mee dissipate sunt, torquentes cor meum. My dayes, lorde, passed are, And olde I am, I am no faunt. My thoughtes wandre wyde whare, ffor they ben, lorde, full variaunte. Myne herte they greuyn wonder sare, ffor euer aboute hym they haunte. Thys maketh me to drowpe and dare That I am lyke a pore penaunte. Though I be, lorde, vnsuffisaunte, Any helpe to gete of the, Yet, for I am thy creaunte, Lorde, Parce michi, domine! (41) Noctem verterunt in diem, et rursum post tenebras spero lucem. The nyght they turned in-to the day, ffor they maden me to wake all nyght. I myght nat slepe by no way, Suche thoughtes were in myn hert plyght. In derkenesse dymme as I so lay, Yet hoped I after the clere day lyght; But thoughtys me so trobled ay, That I was than a wofull wyght. But, lorde, as thow art mekyl of myght, All euyll thoughtes put fro me, And that I of the may haue a syght, Lorde, Parce michi, domine! (42) Si sustinuero, infernus domus mea est; in tenebris straui lectulum meum. Lorde, yef I shall suffre thys grete disese, Hit woll me brynge vnto my graue. And yet ywys I may nat chese, Whether I be kyng, knyght or knaue. In derkenesse dymme, all oute of ese, My lytell bed spred I haue; That bed shall I neuer lese, Though I wolde for angor raue, Tyll the day of dome, that of my graue I shall aryse, and mo with me. My soule, lorde, I pray, thow saue With Parce michi, domine! (43) Putredini dixi, pater meus es; mater mea et soror mea, vermibus. To roten erthe, ryght thus sayde I, \"Thow art my fader of whom I cam,\" And vnto wormes sekurly, \"Thow art my moder, thy son I am; [MS. am I] My systren all ye bene, for why, None other then ye, forsoth I am.\" I shall call hem sustres, lo, for thy, ffor I shall roote amonge hem. Of the lowest erthe god made Adam, Of whyche my kynde I had, as he. Now, lorde, that art lykened to a lambe, So Parce michi , domine! (44) Vbi est ergo nunc prestolacio mea et paciencia mea? tu es, domine, deus meus. Where ys myn abydyng nowe, And all my pacience therto? They ben away, I wote neuer howe, ffor sothe me wanteth bothe two Yef myn hert be styf and towe, To thanke the in wele and woo, Hit ys nat I, but only thow, Thow art my lord and god also. O thow grete lord, alpha and oo, Helpe me, for thy grete pyte! I haue y-nowgh, I pray the, hoo, And Parce michi, domine! (45) PElli mee consumptis carnibus adhesit os meum, et derelicta sunt tantummodo labia circa dentes meos. TO my skyn my mouth ys, lo, And cleued fast, as ye se may; And wasted ys my flesshe also, And bothe my lyppes ben away. My whyte tethe, they ben full bloo. Ye wolde be agaste, yef ye me say.

My frendes namly, now helpe\u00fe at nede! ffor I am there I may nat fle. The hande of god ful sore I drede. And frendes, seeth that I am he, Thys other day that on the erth yede. Now helpe, yef that youre wyll be, With prayer, fastyng, and almes-dede. ffor these mowen best gete me mede With Placebo And Dirige. Herewith my soule I pray yow fede, With Parce michi, domine! (47) Quare persequimini me sicut deus, et carnibus meis saturamini? Why, as god, do ye pursewe Me that suffre these sharpe shoures? Ye lat me peyne here in a peynfull pewe, That ys a place of grete doloures. Yow I chese for frendes trewe, And made yow myne executoures. But tyme shall come that ye shall rewe That euer ye were to me so false treytoures. My good ye spent, as hit were youres, But nat a peny yeuyn ye me. Nowe for all suche faytoures, Lorde, Parce michi, domine! (48) Quis michi tribuat, vt scribantur sermones mei? Who may graunte me thys boone, That my wordes wreten were In ensample of euerychon That hap may to ben in care? ffor yef they wolden make moone, Eyther groche with hert sare Ayenst god, that sytteth in troone, Because, yef they wolden spare, And make nat so ferly fare, But take ensample wolden of me. Now, lorde, as I am but wormes ware, So Parce michi, domine! (49) Quis michi det vt exarentur in libro stilo ferreo, aut plumbi lamina vel celte sculpantur in silice? Who shall graunt me, or I be dede, To wryte hem by oon and oone, My booke with ynke blak or rede, Made with gumme and vermylone? Or ellys yet in plate of lede, Or grauen in harde flynte of stone, That all men, where euer they yede, Myght otherwhyle loke theropon? I wolde my frendys and my foon Ensample take myght by me. As thow art thre, and god aloon, Now Parce michi, domine! (50) Scio enim quod redemptor meus viuit, et in nouis|simo die de terra surrecturus sum, et rursum circumdabor pelle mea, et in carne mea videbo deum, saluatorem meum. I wote ryght well that myn redemptour Lyueth yet, and lyue shall aye, And I shall ryse, I not what oure, Oute of the erthe on domysdaye, And take to me my furst coloure, In flesshe and felle, clad on clay.

(51) Quem visurus sum ego ipse, et oculi mei conspec|turi sunt, et non alius. Whan I mysylfe shall see in syght With eyen clere, and hert[e] stable, And knowe hym as god almyght, That was for me man disparitable, Shall ther fore me noon other wyght Se my god that ys durable, But I mysylfe, with eyen bryght, Shall hym beholde most honorable. O lord, that charyte that ys so amyable, And bryght shynyng in thy mageste, That syght to se, lord, make me able, Thorow Parce michi, domine! (52) Reposita est hec spes mea in sinu meo. Thys hope ys in myn hert[e] sette, That neuer from me shall dysseuere. Thereyn my truste also ys knette, The whyche to haue now ys me leuere.

Though I be synfull, lorde, take me neuer In any thyng that may displese the. Thy blysse, late me haue for euer, Thorough Parce michi, domine!

Wold god I had consumed be With-in myn oune moders skynne, That the eye, with whyche I se, Had nat seyn nomore ne mynne, That I myght in that degre Neuer haue wyste what had be synne, ffor syn maketh me from the to twynne, That of nought madest thow me. Thy mercy, lord, make me to wynne With Parce michi, domine! (54) ffuissem quasi non essem, de vtero translatus ad tumulum. And, wold god, that I be hadde As a thyng that neuer was; ffor all with synne I am be-stadde, And euery day I do trespas. No wonder though I be vngladde, And though I synge often allas; ffor pure woo I wexed madde, Nere goddys mercy my solas. Lo, lorde, lo, I am ryght as A wytles man withouten the; But as thow of plente mercy has, So Parce michi, domine! (55) Nunquid non paucitas dierum meorum finietur breui? Whether the fewnes of my dayes Shull nat hastyly haue an ende? Sythen I can se by no worldly wayes, But oute of the world sone shal I wende, The worldes wyles ryght nat me payes, ffor they ben false and full vn-thende.

Now, good Ihesu, to the I pray, As thow art god in trinite, ffrom that londe thow kepe me ay, Thorow Parce michi, domine! (57) Terram miserie et tenebrarum, vbi vmbra mortis et nullus ordo, sed sempiternus horror inhabitans. The londe of myschyef and of derknes, Where as dampned soules dwell, The londe of woo and of wrechednesse, Where ben mo peynes than tonge may telle, The londe of dethe and of duresse, In whyche noon order may dwelle, The londe of wepyng and of drerynesse, And stynkyng sorow on to smelle: Now from that londe that cleped ys helle, Worthy lord, rescue now thow me, So that I maye euer with the dwelle Thorough Parce michi, domine! Here endeth the ix lessons of the Dirige, which Yob made in his tribulacion.", "25": "XXVI. Here begynneth a tretyse of Parce michi, domine. [ Douce 322, leaf 15.] [19 stanzas of 8, 12 or 16, in alternates.] [A picture comes here of a man lying in a field under a tree. A dejected-looking bird stands near, with a scroll coming from its mouth, on which are the words \"Parce michi.\"\u2014A. F. P.] (1) By a forest syde, walkyng as I went, Disporte to take, in o mornyng, A place I fonde shadyd with bowes I-bent, Y-set aboute with floures so swete smellyng. I leyde me doune apon that grene, And caste myn eyen me aboute; I fonde there byrdys with feders shene, Many oon sittyng apon a rowte. Oon byrde there-by sate on a brere: Here federes were pulled, she myght nat fle. She sate and sange with mornyng chere, \" Parce michi, domine! (2) Spare me, lorde, kyng of pyte,\" Thus seyng thys byrde in pore aray; \"My myrthe ys go, and my iolyte, I may nat fle as other may. My federes shene bene pulled me fro, My youth, my streyngthe, and my beawte. Wher-thorough I take thys songe me to: Parce michi, domine! \" (3) When I herde thys mornyng song, I drewe to thys byrde nere and nere, And asked who had don thys wrong, And brought her in so drowpyng chere, And who had pulled her feders awey, That shuld her bere from tre to tre, And why she sange in her lay Parce michi, domine! (4) The byrde answered, and seyde me tyll, \"Man, be in pese, for crystes sake. Yef I shewe the myn hertys wyll, Peynes me sore woll awake. Yef thow wolt take my worde in mynde, There shall no sorow be my lettyng, That I nyll holy myne herte vnbynde, And sothely telle the thyne askyng, Whyche were my feders that were so clere, And who hath pulled hem all fro me, And why I syt singyng on brere Parce michi, domine! (5) ffeders iiij I had y-wys, The two were set on euery wynge. They bare me breme to my blys, Where me lust be at my lykyng. The furst was 'youth,' the ij de 'beawte,' 'Streyngth' and 'ryches' the other two. And now they been, as thow mayst se, All iiij federes fallen me fro. My principall federe, youthe hit was. He bare me ofte to nysete; Wherefore my songe ys now, allas, Parce michi, domine! (6) In youthe I wrought folyes fele, My hert was set so hygh in pryde, To synne I yaue me euerydele, Spared I neyther tyme ne tyde. I was redy to make debate. My lyfe stode ofte in mechyll drede; And my lykyng, to walke late, And haue my luste of sinfull dede. I was now here, I was now there, Vnstable I was in all degre. To hym I crye, that Mary bare, Parce michi, domine! (7) ffor Salamon seyth in his poyse, Thre weyes there beth full harde to knowe: Oon ys a shyp that sayleth in the see, An egle an hygh, a worme in lowe. And of the fourth, telle he ne can: Hit ys so wonderfull in hys heryng, The weyes of a yonge man, Whyche that ben here at theyre lykyng. And now hathe age y-smete me fro My pryncipall feder of Iolyte. ffor all that euer I haue mys-do, Parce michi, domine! (8) My ij de feder hyght 'bewte.' I helde my selfe so clere of shappe, That all the peple shuld loke on me, And worshyp me with hood and cappe. My rudde was rede, my colour clere, Me thought neuer none so fayre as I, In all a contre, ferre ne nerre, In fetewres and shap so comly. My forhede large, my browes bent; My eyen clere, and corage bolde. My shappe ne myght no man amende, Me thought my self so fayre to beholde. And yet I was begyled in syght. The myrrour, lorde, disceued me. Wherfore I aske, lorde, of thy myght, Parce michi, domine! (9) Thys feder me bare full ofte to synne, And pryncipally to lechery. Clyppyng and kyssyng cowde I nat blynne, Me thought hit crafte of curtesy. A cusse, hit ys the deuylles gynne; Ofte of hit aryseth woo and wrake. The deuyll with cusse many doth wynne. I counseyle the, thow syn forsake. Sampson loste hys streyngth therfore, Dauid hys grace, for bersabee, Tyll he cryed with wordes sore Parce michi, domine! (10) Salamon, that worthy kyng, ffull fayre he was from top to toe, Wherfore in hys age yong He was amabilis domino; That after he felle foule and sore ffor luste of wemen that was hym nygh. They fonned hym in hys age hore, That he forsoke hys god on hygh. Nat oonly these, but many mo Bewte hath begyled, ywys. I wote well I am oon of tho; I can the better telle thys. Nowe hathe age y-smyte me fro My secund feder, that hyght beawte. ffor all that euer I haue mysdo, Parce michi, domine! (11) My thryd feder, 'streynght' hyght. My name was knowe on euery syde, ffor I was man of mochell myght, And meny oon spake of me full wyde. To pryke and praunce I was full prest, My streyngthe to kepe in euery place; And euermore I had the best: Suche was my hap, suche was my grace. My streyngth full ofte me drowe amys, And torned me, lorde, clene fro the. Now, kyng crouned in heuen blys, Parce michi, domine! (12) Thys feder bare me beyonde the see, To gete me name in vncouth lande. To robbe and slee, had I deynte, Ne spared I neyther for no bande. Of holy churche toke I no yeme, Bokes to take, ne vestement. There myght nothyng so moche me queme As robbe, or se an abbey brente. With streyngth I gate me grete aray, Precious clothes, golde, and fee. I thought full lytell on that day, Parce michi, domine! (13) When Nabugodonozor, ferse in fyght, Ierusalem had thought to wynne, And so he dyd with mayne and myght, And brent the temples that were theryn, And all the golde that he there founde, He toke with hym, and home gan ryde, Hym thought there shuld nothyng withstonde; Hys hert was sette so hygh in pryde, Tyll the kyng of myghtes moste Brought hym there that lowest was, And caught hym from hys ryall hoste, And drofe hym to a wyldernesse. And there he lyuyd with herbe and rote, Walkyng euer on foot and on honde, Tyll cryste of mercy dede hym bote, And hys pryson oute of bonde. Than sayde thys kyng these wordys y-wys: 'All thyng be, lorde, at thy pouste; Mercy I crye, I haue do mys; Parce michi, domine!' (14) Whyle I had my streyngth at wyll, ffull many a man I dyd vnreste. They that wold nat myne heste fulfyll, My knyfe was redy to hys breste. And nowe I syt here blynde and lame, And croked ben my lymes all. I was full wylde, I am now tame. Thys feder of streyngth ys fro me fall. And now hathe age smetyn me fro My thryd feder of iolyte. ffor all that euer I haue mysdo, Parce michi, domine! (15) My fourth feder, 'Ryches' was. To make hit shyne, I trauayled sore. I wente in many a perylous place, Well ofte my lyfe was nygh for-lore. By dale, by doune, by wodes syde, I boode many a bytter shoure; In salt see I sayled well wyde ffor to multiply my tresoure. With false sleyghtes I gate my good, In Couetyse I grounded me. Ihesu, for thy precious blood, Parce michi, domine! (16) When I was seker of golde y-nowgh, I gan to ryde abowte well faste. I purchased moche, and god wote howgh. I wende thys lyfe wolde euer haue laste. I lete me bylde castelles and toures, Withoute y-warded with stronge dyches, Withyn y-bylde halles and bowres; There was no toure my castell lyche. In thys was set all my lykyng, And torned me, lorde, holy from the. To the I crye now, heuen kyng, Parce michi, domine! (17) When I was most in all my flowres, And had aboute me wyfe and chylde, I lost my catell and my toures. Then wexed myn hert in party mylde. Catell felle fro me sodeynly; Ryght as hit came, hit went awey. Men seyen 'good geten vntrewly, The iij de eyre browke hit ne may.' I was full wylde, I am now tame. ffortune hath pulled ryches fro me. Your wreche, lorde, I cannat blame. Parce michi, domine! (18) Iob was rycher then euer was I, Of golde, syluer, and o\u00feer good; Hit felle hym fro, and that sharply, As dyd the water out of the flood. Hym was nat lefte so mekyll a clothe Hys naked body for to hele. Hym lacked crostys of a lofe, When hym lyste ete in tyme of mele. And yet he helde vp then hys hande, And seyde, 'hygh god in mageste, Line 222 is repeated after line 223. I thanke the of thy swete sande. Parce michi, domine! ' (19) Now Parce michi, domine! My ioy, my myrthe, ys all agone. Youthe, streyngth, and my beawte, My federes fayre, be fall me fro. Wherto ys a man more lyke, Then to a floure that spryngeth in may? All that lyuen, bothe pore and ryche, Shall dye, vnknowyng of her day.\" I set me doune apon my kne, And thanked thys byrde of here good lore. I bethought me well, of thys worde parce , Was bale and bote of gostly sore. Now parce , lorde, and spare thow me, Thys ys a worde that sone geteth grace. And parce geteth goddys pyte, And sheweth to vs hys blessed face.
