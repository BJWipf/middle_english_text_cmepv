Whan it was to the tyme sped, That kynge Iour shuld be wed, He sent after, withouten mo, The Sowdan of Babylon tho And after the Sowdan of Percy: What nedethe, theyr names to discryc?

Whan the feste shulde begynne, Euery knyght went to his ynne; Whan the feste was al done, Kynge Ioure wolde home go With Iosian, that lady bright, That was true both day and nyght. Iosian was brought to chare With great thought & moche care. Kynge Ermyne toke Arundel And saddled hym fayre and wel; He toke wyth hym gode Morglay, And to kynge Iour gan he say: 'Haue here, I gyue the this stede, Stalworth and gode at euery nede, Haue here Morglay of stele browne: They longed both to Beuys of Hampton!' Kynge Iour hym thanked then And rode forth before his men. O. Tho they were com ny Mombraunte, Whan O. com ny] nere O. He swore be sir Termagaunte, He] The kynge O. sir ] om. O.

O. Now is Iosyan a quene, Beues in preson hath moche tene. And B. O. hath] wyth O. 2071 ff.: Beuys sayde: 'Bretherne dere, For what thynge abyde ye here?' They answerde hym, that there stode: 'We stande here, for to haue some gode!' Beuys sayde: 'Who shal vs gode do?' 'The quene,' they sayde, 'we byleue so, For al that she hathe fonde here, Euery day this seuen yere, Gode chere she dothe them make Onys on a day for goddys sake, And also she dothe it, by my crowne, For Beuys loue of Hampton.' Than sayde Beuys: 'For Crystes ore, Tel me nowe, ye palmers pore, Whan this almys shal be done!' 'Syr,' they sayde, 'at after-none!' Beuys sayde: 'Yet is it but erly day!' Therfore he went fro them away; He thought, he wolde go spye & se, Howe that it myght best be. Than, as he cam by a turret, That in the castel wal was set, He herde Iosian wepe and crye; Theder than went he to espye. 'Alas,' she sayde, 'for syr Beuys, He gentyl knyght of South-hampton is: Wheder I shal neuer se that day, That I wyth hym speke may? But Iesu Cryste, I the pray, Helpe me nowe, as thou best may!' This seuen yere euery day Iosian, that fayr may, Was wont, suche sorowe for to make For syr Beuys of Hamptons sake. Sone after she went to the gate thore, For to let in the palmers pore. Beuys hyed fast to the gate, Lyst he shulde haue come to late; The palmers presed in fast, Beuys abode and was the last. Unto the hal she led them than; Than vnto Beuys sayde Iosian: 'Palmer, thou semest best to me, Therfore men shal worshyp the: Begyn the borde, I the pray, Thou semest best, withouten nay!' Whan the palmers were al set, Mete and drynke was to them fet; Than dyd Iosian to Beuys say: 'Tel me, palmer, by thy fay, Hardest thou euer tel, In any londe, there it befel, Eyther in felde or ellys in towne, Of syr Beuys of Hampton? I shal make hym ryche, wythout lesynge, That can tel me of hym tydynge!' 'Ye, dame,' sayde Beuys and loughe, 'Syr Beuys knowe I wel ynoughe: At home in his owne cuntre I am an Erle and so is he; There he loued me wel I-wys, He was my felawe and I was his. At home he gan me moche tel Of an horse, called Arundel. I haue asked in many a londe For that horse, I vnderstonde, I haue hym sought both farre and nere, But euer men say, that he is here: Ryght as ye loue that same knyght, Late me haue of that horse a syght!' Than the quene, without fable, Led Beuys into the stable. The quene began Beuys to beholde; Than vnto Bonyface she tolde: 'I trowe,' she sayde, 'by my crowne, This is syr Beuys of Hampton; But Beuys browe was neuer torne, Sythe he was of his moder borne!' Whan Beuys into the stable cam, Lyghtly to Arundel he ranne; He sayde: 'Arundel, god the saue, Without the towne I wolde the haue! Wyth the come I neuer to Mambraunt, But with me thou shuldest to England!' He brast in sonder cheynes seuen, Whan he harde Beuys steuen; Of the stable ran he out, And many one put he in great dout. 'Alas,' sayde Iosian tho, 'For Arundel I am ful wo, For he wyl be many a mannys bane, Ere that he agayne be tane!' 'Nay, nay,' sayde Beuys and loughe, 'I can take hym wel ynoughe; So that ye wyl gyue me leue, I shal hym take wythout greue!' To take the horse she hym prayde: 'And lede hym vp!' the lady sayde, 'Let there be no more dystaunce, And I shal after the auaunce!' 'I graunt,' sayde Beuys, 'by goddys dome!' Whan Arundel sawe his lorde come, He wolde neyther stryke ne lope, Tyl Beuys fote was in the styrope. Beuys hym selfe in the sadyl threwe, And therby Iosian anon hym knewe; She sayde: 'Beuys, loue dere, Ryde nat fro me in no manere! Thou promysed, me to wyfe to take, Whan I my fals goddys dyd forsake: Helpe me, Beuys, at this nede, For thou hast Arundel, thyn owne stede; I shal the fetche thy swerde Morglay, And lede me, Beuys, wyth the away!' Syr Beuys sayde: 'By saynt Iame, If I the loue, I were to blame: For the I lay in pryson stronge Seuen yere, and that was longe; Also the patriarke on my lyfe Charged me, neuer to take wyfe, But if she were a mayden clene, And seuen yere thou hast ben quene, And euery nyght a knyght by the; Howe shuldest thou than a mayden be?' 'Mercy, syr Beuys,' than sayde she, 'Haue me home to thy cuntre: But ye fynde me a true woman In al that euer ye say can, Sende me hyder to my fo, My selfe naked and no mo!' 'I graunt,' sayde Beuys, 'that thou wyth me go, On that couenaunt, that it be so: Hye the fast and make the prest, If thou wyth me go lest!' Bonyface stode a lytel besyde And herde theyre counsel in that tyde; 'Syr Beuys,' he sayde, 'it is peryl; I shal you tel a better skyl: The kynge is gone on huntynge, certayne, And sone wyl he retourne agayne; If he fynde, we be a way, He wil pursue bothe nyght and day Wyth al his great chyualry; Than we for our trechery Thoroughe the towne shal drawen be And after hanged vpon a tre. Syr Beuys,' he sayde, 'I wyl you rede, Arundel to stable agayne ye lede, And at the gate ye shal abyde, For, whan the kynge doth in ryde, He wyl of you aske tydynges, I wene, In what cuntrees ye haue ben; Ye shal tel hym redely, That ye come out of Surry; Tel, that londe is greatly noyed, The townes brent & men destroyed, And that kynge Bradwyn is In poynt, to lese his londe, I-wys, Thoroughe kynge Syracke, wythouten fayle, Whyche often tymes doth hym as|sayle; Loke, ye tel hym none other, For kynge Bradwyne is hys broder, And whan he hereth this tydynge, He wyl go thyder wyth great hastynge With al his power and al is oste; Than may we go wyth lytel boste!' Than sayde Beuys: 'I holde me payde!' He led vp the horse as he sayde. Sone after cam the kynge from hunt|ynge, And at Beuys he asked tydynge; Vnto the kynge tolde Beuys thore, As Bonyface tolde hym before. 'I haue great wonder,' sayde kynge Iour, 'That he sendeth nat hyder for socour!' 'The messangers were taken fyue,' Syr Beuys sayde, 'by my lyue, That cam from kynge Bradwyne; I the tel by goddys pyne: Kynge Syracke hathe them in holde, I trowe, it be nat to Bradmonde tolde!' 'Certaynly,' sayde kynge Iour, 'I wyl haste me to that stoure, For to helpe to venge my broder In his ryght agaynst that other!' Than kynge Iour withe al his chyualry Forthe went vnto Surry, But his stywarde, syr Grassy, He left at home ful redely. Than cam togeder in that case Beuys, Iosian and Bonyface: 'Nowe is tyme,' sayde Beuys, 'to go!' 'Nay,' sayde Boniface, 'ye shal nat so: The kynges stywarde, syr Grassy, Is made kepar of my lady; I knowe a grasse,' he sayde, 'I-wys, That of suche vertue is, That who euer therof do drynke, It wyl make theyr iyen to wynke. This grasse shal make them slepe by myght Al a day and al a nyght: Had Grassy dronke this grasse in wyne, Than myght we go wyth counsel myn!' Whan Bonyface had done that thynge, Up they rose, wythout lesynge, On the morowe, wythouten mys, Iosian, Bonyface and Beuys, They purueyed them as they wolde, Bothe of syluer and of golde; They hyed them forthe on theyr way. Syr Grassy a-woke on the other day; Whan he wyst, the quene was gone Wyth the palmer, he made great mone. He made his men them to dyght, myde O. And gadred great power for to fyght. Than he rode forthe al by-dene After the palmer and the quene; Al Mambraunt after them droughe, Wepened and armed wel ynoughe; On euery syde a great rout. They beset Beuys rounde about. Than sayde Beuys to Bonyface: 'Thou seest, we be in straunge case: Thou shalt wyth Iosian abyde here styl, Tyl I go fyght wyth them my fyl; They shal abye, if that I may, For I haue rested me many a day; Had ye neuer so gode gamynge, euer O. As ye shal se, whan we ar samynge!' 'Nay,' sayde Bonyface tho, 'Forsothe, it shal nat be so, I shal brynge you in lesse dout: We ar beset rounde about; A lytel space besyde vs here Is a caue in a roche nere; Were we onys therin brought, For them al I care ryght nought!' To the caue nowe haue they thought, Grassy sought and fonde them nought, And therfore he was ful wo; Therfore agayne home-warde dyd he go. In that caue they were al nyght Wythout mete or drynke, I you plyght; Iosian on the morowe hungred sore And vnto Beuys complayned therfore. Beuys sayde to Bonyface: 'Kepe here Iosian in this place, And I wol on this hyl go, If I may any beste slo, That we may on the coles cast, For Iosyan may nat wel fast!' Forthe went Beuys in that stounde Wyth hym he led a gode grehounde. Than, whan syr Beuys went them fro, Into the caue cam lyons two, Grennynge and rampynge wyth theyr fete, And bothe on Bonyface gan they lepe; His hors vnto hym he droughe And armed hym wel ynoughe; He gaue them batayle for to fyght, But al to lytel was his myght, For anone they hym slewe And hym and his hors al to-gnewe. Whan they had eten of that man They went bothe vnto Iosian And layde theyr hedes in hyr barme, But they wolde do hyr no harme, For it is the lyons kynde, I-wys, A kynges doughter, that mayden is, Hurt nor harme none to do; Therfore lay these lyons so. Whan Beuys cam from huntynge, In the caue, at the begynnynge, begynnyge (!) O. As he went in-warde for the nonys, He sawe a man gnawen al to the bones; Into the caue than went he, To se, what case there myght be; Iosian sat in moche dout And two lyons hyr about. 'Gode syr,' sayde Iosian tho, 'Come venge me of these lyons two, For ryght nowe haue they slayne Bonyface, my chamberlayne; The one lyon wyl I holde, Whyle ye make the other colde!' About the necke she toke the one, But Beuys bad hyr lat hym gone: 'I say, Iosian, let them ben! I se, thou art a mayden clene: What maystry is it, them to slo, In bondes whan thou holdest them so? Late them come to me both, Or ellys, forsothe, I wol be lothe!' She lete go the lyon, wythout mys. And bothe they assayled syr Beuys. Stronge and perylous was that fyght Bytwene the lyons and the knyght; They gaue hym woundes longe & wyde And tare his armour on euery syde. Beuys loked on Iosian, And suche a confort toke he than, That, thoughe the lyons were grym and lothe, At one stroke he slewe them both. For Bonyface ful wo was he, But whan he sawe, no bote wolde be, He toke vp Iosian in that tyde And on his way forth gan ryde. They had nat ryden but a whyle, Nat the mountenaunce of a myle, But they met wyth a geant Wyth ful sory semblant. This geant was bothe myghty & stronge And fully thrytty fote longe; lenge O. He was brysteled lyke a sowe, A fote he had bytwene eche browe, His lyppes were great & hanged syde, His iyen were holowe, his mouth was wyde. Lothely he was to loke on than And lyker a deuyl than a man. His staf was a yonge oke, Harde and heuy was his stroke. Beuys wondred on hym ryght And hym enquyred, what he hyght, And if al the men of his cuntre Were as myghty and great as he. 'My name,' he sayde, 'is Ascaparde, Syr Grassy sent me hyder-warde, For to brynge you home agayne, And nowe I am very fayne, That I haue you here founde, For bothe togeder ye shal be bounde; Than shal I lede you to Mambraunt Wyth a ful sory semblaunt!' 'Yet,' sayde Beuys, 'thou mayst fayle: I shal fyrst sle the in batayle!' Of Arundel downe he lyght And toke hym to Iosian the bryght; Than Beuys wyth a bolde hart Wyth Morglay assayled Ascaparde; Bytwene them two was great fyght, Syr Beuys was bothe nemble and wyght And start away from his dynt, Whan Ascaparde at hym dyd mynt. If his hart shulde haue brast, He coude no stroke on Beuys fast, For, had he hyt syr Beuys onys, He wolde haue broken al his bonys. his his (!) O. Beuys skypped here and thore And gaue hym woundes wyde and sore; Than Ascaparde was ful wo And smote at syr Beuys tho, He smote, to hyt syr Beuys crowne, His fote fayled and he fel downe, And or that he aryse myght, Beuys was redy wyth his swerde bryght, To haue smyten of his hede, But Iosyan dyd it forbede: 'Syr,' she sayde, 'ye shal hym saue And late hym lyue and be your knaue!' 'Dame,' he sayde, 'he wyl vs betray!' 'I wyl be borowe,' she sayde, 'nay!' Ascaparde made Beuys homage And in that place becam his page. Than went they forthe al thre, Tyl they cam to the se; A dromonde fonde they redy thare, Into crystendome for to fare; There were Sarazyns great plente, That letted Beuys therin to be. Whan Ascaparde harde of that, Anone he toke hym to his bat 1 And droue them out wyth moche harme And bare Arundel vnder his arme; Beuys and Iosian to shyp he bare And drewe vp the sayle & made them fare. They sayled forth, soth to sayne, Unto the hauen of Coleyne. Beuys went into the londe, And sone a frende there he fonde: The bysshop of that towne, parcas, To syr Beuys besyb was. Syr Beuys gret wel the bysshop bolde, And, what he was, to hym he tolde. Than was the bysshop wel apayde: 'My dere cosyn, welcome!' he sayde; 'That I you se, I am ful fayne: Sothly, I wende, ye had ben slayne! Whens,' he sayde, 'is this lady shene?' Beuys sayde: 'Of hethenes a quene; For hyr I suffred moche peyne, And she wolde become crysten fayne!' 'What is,' sayde he, 'this bad vysage?' 'Syr,' sayde Beuys, 'he is my page: I pray you crysten hym also, Thoughe he be bothe blacke and blo!' The bysshop crystened Iosian, That was as whyte as any swan; For Ascaparde was made a tonne, And whan he shulde therin be done, He lept out vpon the brenche And sayde: 'Churle, wylt thou me drenche? The deuyl of hel mot fetche the: I am to moche, crystened to be!' The folke had gode game and loughe, But the bysshop was wrothe ynoughe. Beuys is nowe in Coleyne londe Thoroughe myght of Crystes honde; There he gate great renowne For the sleynge of a dragowne; For whan syr Launcelot du Lake Faught wyth the brennynge drake, Guy of Warwycke, I vnderstonde, Slewe a dragon in Northumberlonde; But suche a dragon was neuer sene, As syr Beuys slewe, I wene. Beuys went to bed a nyght With moche ioy and torches bryght, And after hys fyrst slepynge He herde a ruful cryenge; The voyce sayde in his crye: 'Lorde Iesu, haue on me mercy! I rotte,' he sayde, 'bone by bone, My deth is comynge me vpon!' Beuys had therof great sorowe And asked men there on the morowe, He asked them, what was that crye, aske O. They answered and tolde hym why; They sayde, it was a noble knyght, That was stronge and bolde in fyght, And as he rode out of the towne, He met wyth a fel dragon, That hath venym vpon hym throwe, There lyeth the knyght al to-blowe; And I shal tel you al the cas, Howe of the dragon the comynge was. In Calaber, as men tel, Were two dragons great and fel, These two dragons there dyd fyght Seuen yere bothe day and nyght, They destroyed both man and beste On euery syde, bothe west and este. There was a man in that londe, That was ful of goddys sonde; He prayed vnto god aboue, That he wolde for his moders loue Delyuer out by his holy grace These two dragons out of that place. Than these two dragons downe fel, They had no power there to dwel. Than flewe they to Tuskayne, Many men there haue they slayne, From Tuskayne vnto Lumbardye, There they dyd great velany. The one dragon, by goddys dome, Flewe vnto the court of Rome; He there rested his cursed bonys, In seuen yere he styreth nat onys; Men say, he is there yet, Enclosed wyth clerkes wyt. The other dragon, I vnderstonde, Flewe hyder to Coleyne londe; Wythin a clyue there lyeth he, clyue] myle O. But a myle from the se; In Coleyne londe al about They haue of hym great dout. That dragon was here this nyght And hath destroyed the foresayde knyght. 'Lorde Iesu Cryst,' sayde Beuys tho, 'May no man that dragon slo?' 'Nay,' they sayde, 'wythout fable, Al crystendome were nat able; But if Myghel from heuen come downe, Shal no man sle that dragon!' Beuys called Ascaparde hym to And asked hym, what was best to do; He sayde: 'Wylt thou wyth me go And assay, that dragon for to slo? Parchaunce, if we wyth hym fyght, We shal hym sle wyth goddys myght!' 'I am redy,' sayde Ascaparde, 'I the hyght: Haue do and go we thyder ryght!' Beuys hym armed and forth gan ryde And Ascaparde by his syde. Whan they were out of the cyte And nere the place, where they shulde be, The dragon kest vp a yelle, That it wolde haue frayed the deuyl of hel. Ascaparde sayde wyth heuy chere: 'Herest thou, mayster, what I here?' 'Yes,' sayde Beuys, 'haue no dout, The dragon is nere here about; Boldly to hym shal we go, Wyth goddys grace we shal hym slo!' Beuys rode forth a fast pase, Where he thought the dragon was. 'Forsoth, syr,' sayde Ascaparde tho, 'I wyl agayne home-warde go, For I wolde not for al pany Se the deuyl, that made that crye!' 'What deuyl,' sayde Beuys, 'art thou so mad? I wende, no thynge myght make the adrad; For shame shalt thou aferde be Of any thynge, or thou it se?' 'Syr,' he sayde with heuy chere, 'I wyl hym neyther se nor here!' 'Wel,' sayde Beuys, 'wylt thou so, I shal hym sle, or that I go!' Ascaparde ferther wolde nought, But Beuys rode forthe and sought, And whan the dragon, that foule is, Had a syght of syr Beuys, He cast vp a loude crye, As it had thundred in the skye; He tourned his bely agaynst the sonne, Whyche was as great as any tonne; His skales bryghter were than glasse And moche harder than any brasse; Bytwene his shulders and his tayle Was XL fote, wythouten fayle. He weltred out of his denne, Beuys pryked his stede then And to hym a spere he thrast, That al to sheuers it brast. Than dyd the dragon Beuys assayle And so sore smote hym wyth hys tayle, That to the grounde he hym cast And two of his rybbes he brast. Up stert Beuys wyth gode wyl And after ranne the dragon tyl; Than gode Morglay out he brayde And on the dragon fast he layde, But for no stroke, that he dyd smyte, Wolde nat Morglay on hym byte. The dragon was agreued sore And smote at Beuys more and more; There had he many a great wounde And often was felled to the grounde; What for wery and what for faynt, Syr Beuys was nerehande attaynt. The dragon sued on Beuys so harde, That, as he shulde haue fled bacwarde, There was a wel, so haue I wynne, And Beuys stumbled ryght therin; Than was Beuys aferde and wo, Lest the dragon wolde hym slo, Or that he myght away pas. Whan he in that wel was, Than was that wel of suche vertue Thoroughe the myght of Cryste Iesu, For som tyme dwelled in that londe A vyrgyn full of goddys sonde, That had ben bathed in that wel, That neuer after, as men tel, Myght venymous beste com therin, By the vertue of that vyrgyn, Nor nere it by seuen fote and more; Than was Beuys glad wythout sore. Whan Beuys sawe, the dragon fel Had no myght, to come nere that wel, Than was he glad, wythout fayle, And rested hym there for hys auayle. Than of that water he dranke his fyl And than lept out wyth gode wyl, And wyth Morglay, his bryght bronde, He assayled the dragon, I vnderstonde. Upon the dragon he smote so fast, Where euer he hyt, the skales brast. The dragon was ataynt sore And cast a galon and more Out of his mouthe of venym stronge, And on Beuys he it flonge; It was so venymous, I-wys, That, whan it was on syr Beuys, Al his armour brake that stounde, And Beuys fel dede to the grounde; There was no lyfe in hym sene, But lay as dede vpon the grene. The dragon smote Beuys, wythout fayle, That he turned hym top ouer tayle, But therof toke he no kepe, He lay as dede man on slepe; He smote Beuys, as I you tel, That he tumbled into the wel; That was of great vertue that tyme, For it wolde suffer no venyme, Thoroughe vertue of that vyrgyn That somtyme was bathed therin. Whan Beuys was at the wellys grounde, The water made hym hole and sounde And quenched the venym away, That wel saued hym that day. Whan Beuys felt hym hole and lyght And wyst that wel of so great myght, Than was he a ioyful man And was as fresshe, as whan he began. Than kneled he downe, the sothe to say, To Iesu Cryste gan he pray, That he wolde sende hym myght, To sle the dragon in that fyght. Beuys blessyd hym & forthe rode, He lept forth wyth hart ful gode. Than to the dragon he hyed is, And also the dragon to syr Beuys; Longe and harde was the fyght Bytwene the dragon and the knyght, But whan syr Beuys was hurt sore, He went to the wel & wesshed hym thore; He was as hole and sounde than As he was, when he began. The dragon sawe, it myght nat auayle, Besyde that wel to holde batayle; He thought, he wolde by some wyle Of that place Beuys begyle; He wolde haue flowen than away, Out Beuys lept after wyth gode Morglay And hyt the dragon vnder the wynge, Ryght as he was fleynge. There was he tender wythout skale, So Beuys thought, to be his bale; He smote after, as I you say, Wyth his swerde, gode Morglay, That in vnto the hyltes it yode, Thoroughe hert, lyuer, bone and blode, That to the grounde the dragon fel. Than gladder was Beuys, than tunge coude tel. Under the skale al on hyght The dragons hede he smote of ryght, And stake it vpon his spere, Out vnethys he myght it bere. Than towarde Coleyne he went that tyde Wyth moche ioy, myrthe and pryde. Whan they of the cyte sawe Beuys Come wyth the dragons hede, I-wys, Al the bellys gan they rynge. Prestes & clerkes agayne hym dyd synge. They brought Beuys so into the towne Wyth fayre processyon & great renowne. Than was Beuys in great honoure, Euery man had hym in fauour; In euery londe he praysed was And welcomed to euery place. Fayne was the bysshop tho, That syr Beuys had borne hym so. Beuys went vpon a day To the bysshops chamber, where he lay, And sayde: 'Syr, what is your rede? I wolde go venge my faders dede Of that wycked felon, That slewe my fader wyth treason; If I myght fynde auauntage, To wyn agayne myn herytage: Syr, ye be my faders broder, And syr Sabere is the other; Of you two wolde I haue counsayle, For, certys, that thefe wyl I assayle!' 'Syr,' sayde the bysshop anon ryght, 'Syr Saber is a doughty knyght; For euery yere a day certayne He fyghteth thy stepfader agayne Wyth great baronage, For to wynne thyn herytage. An hundreth men shalt thou haue of me, At thy nede for to socour the. Therfore go thou to Sabere ryght, For he is in the yle of Wyght!' 'I thanke you,' sayde Beuys, 'verely, But late these men be sone redy!' Syr Beuys anon rode than And toke his leue at Iosyan; He sayde: 'My lady, I must go, To be auenged on my fo, For to wyn into my honde Myn herytage and my londe, And here styl shalt thou be, And Ascaparde shal byde wyth the. Ye shal haue, or I wende, Money ynoughe for to spende!' Iosyan sawe, it wolde be so, She kyssed hym and forth gan go, Forth went Beuys wyth his route Of hardy men hym about, That the bysshop hym gaue, So longe on the se they draue, Tyl they cam to a towne, But two myle from South-hampton. Beuys sayde to his men tho: 'Is here any, that wyl go Unto syr Murdour of Almayne, And say, here is come a Brytayne, And doughty knyghtes, wythout dis|tauncee, The best of al the royalme of Fraunce, And say, we come into this londe, For we be done to vnderstande, That there shulde be great warre and fyght Bytwene hym and another knyght; And if he wol vs wyth hym holde, We wol defende hym as barons bolde, And if he wol nat do so, We wol to the other ga?' A knyght went forth on that message, That gentel was of his langage; Whan he cam to the castel gate, The porter lete hym in therat; Wnto syr Murdour was he lad, He tolde hym, as syr Beuys bad. He] And O. Syr Murdour than was ful fayne, He rose vp and went hym agayne, And brought syr Beuys into the hal And ful fayre welcomed them al. Beuys was syr Murdours fere, Forsoth, that nyght at soupere; His owne moder, wythout lesynge, Made syr Beuys great festynge. Murdour asked hym, what he hyght; 'Iarrarde,' he sayde, 'syr, I you plyght!' 'Iarrarde,' he sayde, 'I-wys, This countes had I or thys, An Erle hyr had, or I hyr wed, He gate a chylde on hyr in bed. Whan the erle to dethe was brought, The boy anon wexed ryght nought; For his fader was of symple blode, The boy neuer drewe to gode. So whan the boy cam to age, He solde to me his heritage, He spent the syluer with moche blame And went out of this londe for shame. Nowe cometh his eame, an hardy knyght, That dwelleth in the yle of Wyght, And chalangeth his heritage Wyth ful great baronage And oft tymes wyth his great rout Destroyeth our londe al about. This is the cause, Syr Iarrarde, That we warre togeder so harde.' Whan syr Murdour had al sayde, Beuys sate styl & was euyl apayde; He sayde: 'Lorde, whether shal I slo This fals traytour, or I go?' 'Nay,' he sayde, 'and reason, why: It wolde turne me to velany, For men myght wene be reason, That I hym slewe by gyle and treason; It wolde turne me to cowardyse, If I slewe hym in this wyse; I wyl hym nat here assayle, But I shal hym sle in playne batayle.' Whan Beuys a whyle had sytten styl, 'Syr,' he sayde, 'wol ye here my skyl? I haue hyder company brought, But in armour be they nought; They myght none armour wyth them lede, But if it noyed them, as they yede; And fewe horses, I-wys, haue we, We lete for cariage of the se: Lene me horse & armour then, Bothe for me & al my men, Let vs haue shyppynge to, And we shal to that yle go; This nyght I wyl lyue and dye On hym, that is thyn ennemye, And so wythin a lytel whyle Ye shal here a quaynt gyle!' Syr Murdour dyd, as Beuys hym bede, And lent his men armour and stede; He ordeyned them shyppynge gode And than brought Beuys vnto the flode. Than sayled they forth ryght, Tyl they cam to the yle of Wyght. Sabere out of his castel lay And harde moche noyse & great aray, He sawe, a shyp to londe was pyght Wyth an hundred hedes wyth helmes bryght; He had great wonder, what they were, But Beuys displayed his baner there, dyplayed (!) O. For to make syr Sabere chere Of hys fader, syr Guyes, armere, For many a tyme there beforne Were those armes in batayle borne. Sabere knewe the conysaunt, And therfore made he gode semblaunt, He sayde: 'Certys, I vnderstande, That yonder is Beuys come to lande!' Sabere went thyder in haste, There as the shyp was made fast; He welcomed Beuys, I-wys, And eyther gan other kysse. He thanked god of his grace, That Beuys was come into that place. Than forth went Beuys and Sabere Wyth theyre men al in fere; Beuys dyd his eame to wete, Howe his stepfader and he dyd mete, And Beuys asked forth wyth than, If that there were any man, That durst go as hote Unto Hampton in a bote 'And tel to syr Murdour ryght, That I am no frenche knyght, Nor he hyght nat syr Iarrarde, That made wyth hym that forwarde, But say, it was Beuys of renowne, The ryght heyre of South-hampton, And say, his countesse is my dame: The deuyl gyue them bothe shame! And say, I wyl auenged be Of that they dyd to my fader and me; And who so wyl this for me do, Wythout rewarde he shal nat go!' Up start a knyght wyth bolde vysage And vndertoke that same message; He armed hym also hot And was brought ouer in a bote. Whan he cam to the other syde, Unto the castel gan he ryde; He fonde syr Murdour at his soupere Wyth gode semblant and great chere. The knyght vpon his kne hym set, And curtesly syr Murdour he gret, He sayde: 'Syr Murdour, I the brynge Suche a certayne tydynge, That the knyght hyght nat Iarrarde, That made wyth the that forwarde, But he hyght Beuys of Hampton, He is thy ladyes owne sonne: I harde hym so to Sabere speke, His faders deth he wyl awreke And wyn agayne hys heritage Of them, that haue done hym outrage!' Whan syr Murdour herde that worde, He cast his knyfe ouer the borde, To haue hit the messangere, But he fayled, as ye may here, And smote his owne son in the brest, That he spake neuer wyth clerke nor preste. Than arose a noys and a crye, The messanger dyd hym thens hye, For it was nat gode, to byde there longe, Therfore he lept out them amonge. Than fayre and wel he gan hym dyght, Tyl he come to the yle of Wyght; He tolde syr B\u00e8uys and syr Sabere, Howe syr Murdour sat at soupere, And his owne son for Ire he sloughe; Beuys therat had game and loughe, And gaue the messangere for his ty|dynge Syxty florens of rede golde shynynge. Late we of Beuys be styl than And speke we nowe of Iosyan, That in Coleyne dwelled styl; There she had nat al hyr wyl. There dwelled an erle, called Myle, In the londe of Coleyne that whyle; To Iosyan his loue he cast And wowed hyr wonder-fast, wondr O. But al his speche turned to nought, For he coude nat chaunge hyr thought. The erle was wroth in his manere, For she made hym no better chere; Than in ire downe he hym set And to Iosian spake wordes gret: 'I wyl do wyth the my wyl, Wheder it lyke the wel or yl!' 'Syr,' sayde Iosyan: 'thy boste late be: I drede the nat, so mot I the, For if thou go to the harde, I affye me in Ascaparde!' 'Certys,' than thought the erle Myle: 'I shal Ascaparde begyle!' Whan he sawe, he myght nat spede, Up he rose and forthe he yede; He made a letter be wryten ryght, On this maner it was dyght, From Beuys, as the letter wolde, That Ascaparde come sholde Unto a castel, that stode in an yle; It was from Coleyne but a myle. Whan Ascaparde herde that sonde, He toke his great staf in his honde And went forth with that messangere In great haste, tyl he cam there. Whan Ascaparde was within, The messangere was quaynt of gynne; Wythin he left Ascaparde And locked the gates after hym harde; Than rowed he to londe agayne And tolde syr Myle of that trayne. Than had erle Myle of no thynge drede, To Iosian agayne he yede; He sayde: 'Iosian, make no mone, For Ascaparde is fro the gone: In a castel within the se Locked fast, forsoth, is he!' Than was Iosian nat wel apayde, She called a messanger & to hym sayde: 'Go thou to shyp this same nyght And passe forthe to the yle of Wyght, And byd syr Beuys, for any thynge Come to me wythout lettyng, If he wyl haue me on lyue: Wherfore I pray the, go belyue; Thy rewarde I shal the pay, Spede the thyder wythout delay!' The messanger went on his way, There was no more to say. So Myles sone after than Cam agayne to Iosian And fyrst wolde haue lyne hyr by; 'I pray the, syr,' she sayde, 'mercy, For I haue sworne by goddys payne, That I shal neuer be belayne, Thoughe I therfore shulde lese my lyfe, Tyl I be a wedded wyfe: If thou wylt me spouse & wed, I wyl go wyth the to bed!' 'Gladly, Iosyan!' than sayde he, 'To morowe shal we wedded be!' be] de (!) O. He kyssed hyr anon, as ryght is, And sende after barons & knyghtes, That were of his pryuyte, At his weddynge for to be, For he wolde wed hyr pryuely, In the mornynge erly. Erly on the mornynge he forgat nought, Bothe they were to the churche brought; The erle gan Iosian wed Both to borde and to bed. Whan the weddynge was al done, By than it was hye none; Erles and barons sone were set And ryche metes forthe were fet, Ther lacked none, verely, Of ryche metes and mynstrelsy. Whan it drewe towarde nyght, A ryche souper there was dyght, And after that, verament, The knyght and she to chamber went. Uppon her bedde where as she sat, The erle came to her with that, With barons a great company, With pimente and with spisery; Whan they had dronken the wyne, 'Syr,' sayd Iosian, 'fayre loue myne, Let no person herein be, This night to here our preuite, Neyther knight, mayden nor swayne; My selfe shalbe your chamberlayne!' He sayd: 'Lemman, it shalbe so!' Both man & maiden he made out go, He shet the dore well and fast, And set hym downe at the last. There was a curtayne, as it was lawe, Before the bed it was drawe; Than on her gyrdel, withouten lesinge, Se made a knot rydyng, About his necke she drewe it thore And strangled him, withouten more. Than on a beme she hanged him hye, And let him ther fore his fole. The night passed in that wyse, The barons began for to ryse, Some on hunting & some to \u00fee church, An workemen rose to worche. The halfe day passed, withouten fayle, The barons had of him maruayle. Some said: 'Let him be styll, Of Iosian he hath his will!' The mydday went, it drew to none, A baron spake then sone: 'I maruyle,' he sayd, 'how may this be? I wyll go to the chamber and se!' He smote the dore with his fot so fast, That all to peces he it brast; 'Aryse,' he sayde, 'thou erle Myle, For thou hast slept a great whyle: Thy head aketh, wot I well, Thou hast nede of a caudell!' 'Nay,' sayd Iosian, 'I vndertake, His head shall neuer more ake: I haue charmed him from that sore, That his head shall ake no more; Nowe haue I quitte his weddinge, Yonder mayst thou se him hinge. He shall neuer woman spyll: Do with me what soeuer ye wyll!' All they made great sorowe; That other day on the morowe Se was dight, verament, In a tonne to be brente. Without the towne was set a stake, A great fyre gan they make. In a castel lay Ascaparte, And ouer \u00fee wal loked thederwarte, And had great wonder, truely, What that fyre might signify. Than he thought him in his hert tho, That Iosian was brought in some wo. Of the castel, that he was in loken, A turret he had al to-broken; He was so wo and so wode, That he lept into the flode, And fast by hym also hote Cam a fyssher wyth his bote. Than Ascaparde toke the bote in hande And rowed hym selfe to the londe; vowed (!) O. Towarde the folke fast gan he loke, Beuys cam after and hym ouertoke; He sayde: 'Thefe, where haste thou bene? Why kepest thou no better my quene?' 'Syr Beuys, lorde, mercy,' he sayde, 'The Erle Myle had me betrayde!' Towarde the fyre they hyed them blyue, The preste, that dyd Iosyan shryue, Crystys blessynge haue he amonge, For that he taryed hyr so longe! Whan the fyre was al redy, In hyr smocke she stode therby. Ryght as they shulde hyr brenne, On Arundel Beuys gan renne, And in his hande gode Morglay, But Ascaparde went by another way. Than al, that Beuys about hyr founde, He slewe and felled to the grounde. There was neyther knyght nor swayne, That passed away that tyme vnslayne, And al made the fals erle Myle By his treason and his gyle. Beuys toke wyth hym than Bothe Ascaparde and Iosian And went forth anone ryght, Tyl they cam to the ile of Wyght. Syr Sabere welcomed wyth gode hert Both Beuys, Iosyan and Ascaparde. Than Beuys and Sabere sende theyr sonde Wyde about in euery londe. After great chyualry Of stalworth knyghtes and hardy, That they myght fynde then Of euery londe the doughtyest men. They spared neyther syluer nor golde, For the best men haue they wolde. Beuys was curtes and fre To euery man in his degre; There cam erles and barons, I-wys, For to socour syr Beuys; There came knyghtes, squyers & pages, Echone had of hym gode wages And ryche gyftes more and lesse, Eche man after his doughtynesse. Therfore eche man vnto hym sought, He toke and left, what hym best thought; Euer he chase hym of the beste, That he coude fynde eyther este or west. Syr Murdour, moche sorowe made he, Whan he sawe, Beuys had suche a meyne; The countesse sayde: 'Drede ye nought, Of gode counsel I am bethought: Ye shal sende, in certayne After the power of Almayne, Also ye shal sende your sonde After my fader into Skotlonde, He wyl come to you redely Wyth a ful great company, And we may haue many mo Out of Englonde and Wales also: Wherfore shulde ye drede then, Whyle ye may haue so many men? If Beuys se, you haue suche a rout, He wyl fle away for dout!' Syr Murdour dyd by hyr counsayle, The messanger went, wythout fayle. Than afterwarde, without lesynge, To Hampton cam both prynce & kynge; Ther cam wyth the kynge of Skotlande The noumber of seuen thousande, There cam out of Almayne Wyth syr Moryce of Vyayne Syx thousande wyth helmes bryght And wel armed for to fyght, And syr Murdour had also Thre thousande hym selfe and mo. 'Nowe, lordynges,' sayd syr Murdour, 'That hyther be come me to socour, Oft ye have herde speke, parde, Of the stryfe bytwene Sabere and me. Nowe is come to helpe hym to fyght Syr Beuys of Hampton, a noble knyght; Wel I wende, he had ben dede: What is therfore your best rede? He threteneth me to be slayne And that he wyl wynne his londe agayne; A geant wyth hym hathe he brought, Erthely man semeth he nought, Neyther of flesshe nor of fel, For he is lyke the deuyl of hel; Men cal hym Ascaparde about, Of hym, forsoth, I haue great dout. Lordynges,' he sayde, 'arme you wele Both in iren and in stele: Thoughe Ascaparde be neuer so starke, Many handes make lyght warke!' Whan they were al armed and dyght, They shypped to the ile of Wyght. Al the yle was bespred Wyth the power, that syr Murdour led. Syr Sabere loked out at a toure And sawe the oste of syr Murdour; Then smartly downe gan he go, For to tel syr Beuys so; He sayde: 'Beuys, by my counsayle I trowe, it shulde vs best auayle, Within this castel to holde vs styl And to defende vs from al yl; For suche an oste as hath Murdour, Sawe I neuer in no stour!' 'Do way, Sabere,' sayde Beuys tho, 'For if they were as many mo, Agaynst vs shulde they haue no myght: They haue the wronge, and we the ryght. Haste you, lordynges,' Beuys gan crye, 'That ye were armed hastely, And ye shal haue, syr Sabere, Thre thousande vnder your banere, And as many shal I lede Of doughty men and gode at nede, For I wyl haue the forewarde.' And than he sayde to Ascaparde: 'Thou shalt byde behynde, truly, Wyth thre thousande of men hardy, And whan we haue medled a stounde And echone brought other to grounde, Whan the batayle is moste stronge, Hye he thyder and dwel nat longe, For thre thousande of fresshe men Gode dedys shal do then!' Than Beuys gan his horne blowe, That his men myght hym knowe; By that blowynge knewe syr Murdour, That they gadred to that stour; He sayde: 'Lordynges, wythouten fayle, Nowe come oure ennemyes to batayle: Be ye hardy and stout also, For we be as many mo!' Two batayles gan they make, The kynge of Skotlonde the one gan take; Syr Murdour the other lad, Eyther of them X thousande had. The fyrste, that of the castel cam out, Was syr Beuys wyth his rout, And Sabere wyth his company Cam after ful boldly; Eyther oste gan other defye, Than medled they ful cruelly. Than syr Morys of Vyayne Fast rode syr Sabere agayne; Syr Sabere defended hym, I-wys, And suche a stroke he gaue Morys, haue (!) O. That quyte away gan he cleue, Fro the shulder, arme and sleue. For (!) O. Afore the preas went syr Beuys, On eche syde he felled them downe, I-wys; There myght none armoure agaynst hym stonde. That sawe the kynge of Skotlonde, He preased forth wyth his rout And beset syr Beuys rounde about; Than began Beuys to play And to get hym rowme wyth gode Morglay; Yet wolde he nat stynt so, Tyl he went the kynge vnto, And suche a stroke he hym lent, That his hors on the grounde went. But suche socour cam tho, That Beuys must thens go, But or he was horsed agayne, Many of his men had Beuys slayne; Beuys thoroughe the preas dyd ryde And them ouerthrewe on euery syde, He wolde nat stynt in that stour, Tyl he cam to syr Murdour; 'Traytour,' he sayde wyth great enuye, 'Turne the nowe, I the defye!' Whan Murdour sawe, he was so bested, He tourned his backe and wolde haue fled, And wyth gode Morglay after smote he; He fayled of hym, & that was pyte, For by his backe the stroke fel downe And hyt vpon hys sadyl cropowne; Yet wyth his stroke in that stounde He smote his hors vnto the grounde, But than cam hastely socour And horsed agayne syr Mordour. Than boldly dyd he abyde, The people were slayne on euery syde. Beuys rode forth on Arundel, On euery syde he dyd them fel, Some lay bledynge as a bore, Some were so hyt, that they spake no more, Of some the lyppes he dyd so pare, That men myght se theyre tethe bare, None went vnmarked away, That Beuys hyt wyth Morglay, For sore agreued was he, Where Beuys had one, Murdour had thre, But Beuys and Sabere bare them so, That agayne one they slewe two. Whan the thronge was moste harde, Than cam in Ascaparde, Al on fote, as I you swere, For there myght no hors hym bere; Wyth a great staffe in his honde He slewe al downe, that he fonde. Whan Ascaparde cam wyth hys rout, Than was syr Murdour in great dout, For he brought wyth hym then Thre thousande of fresshe men And felled downe on euery syde And slewe al that wolde abyde. Great pyte it was, certayne, So many men as there were slayne. Aferde thay were of Ascaparde, For he smote so sore and harde, That thre thousand of them dyd fle And drowned them selfe in the se. Beuys called Ascaparde hym tyl And sayde: 'Felawe, here my skyl: Loke, that thou take gode hede Of hym, that rydeth on the whyte stede, And bere hym alyue into the tour, For that same is syr Murdour!' 'Yes, syr,' sayde Ascaparde tho, 'We shal hym shryue, or we go!' Ascaparde, wyth his staue Many one his deth he gaue Wyth great strength and moche payne, He cam to syr Murdour of Almayne, And euen on his horse as he sat there, Under his arme he gan hym bere. Than began Murdoures men to hye, To rescue hym, that he shulde nat dye. The kynge of Skotlande with his rout Beset Ascaparde rounde about; Than syr Beuys and syr Sabere Cam to helpe hym wyth theyre power And slewe al that wolde stande, The noumber of thre thousande, And, maugre if they had sworne, Murdour was to the castel borne. The kynge of Skotlande sore dyd mourne, Whan Murdour was to the castel borne And many of his men were cast to grounde, He tourned his backe in that stounde. Than they wolde no lenger abyde, But slewe them downe on euery syde. Syr Beuys and syr Sabere Enchased them wyth theyre power, And so fast folowed he, That many were dryuen into the se, And al that euer stode them agayne, Wythout mercy they were slayne; Some lacked theyr shankes fro the kne, Some theyr hedes quartered in thre, Some into the se dyd skyp; The kynge of Skotlonde toke a shyp And fled away forthe by the west, There as it hym pleased best. Beuys and Sabere tourned agayne Into the castel glad and fayne; Syr Beuys, wythout any let, Made a caudron on the fyre be set Ful of pytche and of brymstone: A wors deth was neuer none. Whan the caudron boyled harde, Murdour was cast in the myd-warde. That deth dyed he, sykerly, For the deth of gode syr Guy. Therof harde the countasse, That syr Murdour dede was; She stode aboue in a toure, So wo she was for syr Murdour, That she fel downe & brake hyr necke: I beshrewe hym, that therfore doth recke. Whan syr Beuys tydynges herde Of his moder, howe she fared, As sory was he for hyr, As he was for his stepfader. Sone after syr Beuys Come to South-hampton is, To take possession of his londes, That had ben longe out of his hondes; The burgeyses, wyth moche pryde Agaynst syr Beuys gan they ryde And brought syr Beuys fayre and wel To Hampton to his owne castel. Of Hampton al the baronage Cam and dyd Beuys homage. Than was Beuys glad and fayne, That he had his ennemyes slayne. Than Beuys, the soth to sayne, Sende after the bysshop of Coleyne, That he wolde for any thynge Come and be at his weddynge. Whan the bysshop was thyder come, Two knyghtes had Iosian nome; Unto the churche they hyr led, The bysshop on the boke redde And to Beuys hyr wedded blyue Unto the endynge of hyr lyue. Nowe hath Beuys couered hys estate; Two chyldren by hyr he gate The fyrst nyght togeder in fere, As ye shal hereafter here. Saber counsayled hym thare, To wende to London to kynge Edgare, Edare O. For to make homage, as ryght wolde, For his londes to chalange and holde. Syr Beuys dyd after counsaylynge And went hym forthe before the kynge And profered, to do hym homage, As ryght was, for his heritage. Kynge Edgare asked hym, what he hyght And what he claymed for his ryght; 'Syr,' he sayde, 'my name is Beuys; Therldom of Hampton it is, After my faders deth syr Guy, That was slayne for his lady Wyth syr Murdoure of Almayne; But thanked be god, nowe is he slayne!' The kynge sayde: 'Beuys, I holde me payed, I graunt to al, that thou hast sayde!' The kynge toke his marchal by the hande And sayde: 'Delyuer me thy wande, For Guy, his fader, was my marchal, And so syr Beuys, hys son, shal!' The yerde to Beuys he taketh And his marchal he hym maketh. Beuys is nowe of great myght And loued both of kynge and knyght, Wyth euery knyght, squyer and barowne, Beuys was loued vp and downe, For largely wolde he spende And gyftes both gyue and sende To euery man after his estate; Had no man cause, hym to hate; So curteys was he and so hende, That euery man was his frende, Saue syr Bryan of Cornewayle, He hated Beuys, wythouten fayle, For those offyces had Beuys, That sometyme were hys. In somer about wytsontyde, Whan knyghtes moste on hors ryde, A cours they cryed on a day, Stedes and palfrayes to assay, What hors that best myght ren; Thre myle the cours was then. Who fyrst cam to the ende, sholde Haue twenty pounde of redy golde. Syr Beuys was apayde wel, For moche he trusted in Arundel. On the morne, whan it was lyght, Theder cam bothe baron and knyght Wyth fayre stedes and moche pryde, That on that cours wolde ryde. Two knyghtes were stolen before, A large halfe myle and more, That none of theyre felawes yt wote; yt] dyd (!) O. But Beuys wyth his sporys his hors smote, On Arundel, so sayth the boke, In the myd way he them ouertoke. He had ryden the cours within a whyle, Or they thought, he had ryden a myle. Nowe hath Beuys the golde wonne Thoroughe Arundel, that wel had ronne, Therfore wyth that & another del He made the castel of Arundel. They praysed the hors in that cas, For he so swyft and lusty was. The kynges sonne and his ayre Thought the hors both gode and fayre, Unto syr Beuys anon he yede And sayde: 'I pray the, gyue me thy stede!' 'Nay,' sayde Beuys, 'nat for no golde; But aske me ellys what ye wolde, At thy wyl thou shalt it haue, But Arundel do thou nat craue: For any prayer, that man may pray, Shal I neuer gyue Arundel away!' The kynges son sawe, it coude nat auayle, To aske the stede, wythout fayle; Wythout any more fable, He went into syr Beuys stable, For he wolde the hors vntye, And cam a lytel ouer-nye, And Arundel also hote Wyth his hynder fote he smote, That he al to-brake his brayne: Thus was the kynges son slayne. There was dole and great wepynge; Whan tydynges cam vnto the kynge; Than the kynge, verament, Made to be set his parlament And began to ordayne, That syr Beuys shulde be slayne And wyth wylde bestes be drawe; But his barons wythstode that lawe, They sayde: 'To sle Beuys, it were no skyl, But Arundel shal be at thy wyl, For he slewe thy son so, But nought to Beuys may we do!' 'Nay,' sayde Beuys, 'for no catel Wolde I let sle Arundel, For he is gode in euery were; Yet had I leuer Englonde forswere!' Than spake syr Bryan of Cornewayle: 'Syr, this is our counsayle, That ye do one of the two!' 'I assent,' sayde Beuys tho, 'Before you al I gyue here Myn herytage to syr Sabere!' Syr Beuys delyuered vp the wande And so forsware Englande; A fortnyght respyte had he, For to passe out of the cuntre; And afterwarde myght be founde, He shuld be take & fast be bounde. On thys maner they were al one, And to Hampton he rode anone, And al togeder tolde he thore Of his case, bothe lesse and more: 'It is no lenger but hens to morne, For here may we no lenger soiourne!' Beuys and Iosian made them redy And toke theyre leue for to ferry. Sabers sonne, that hyght syr Terry, Beuys toke wyth hym for company. Ascaparde, that fals thefe, For hym was Beuys in moche grefe; He thought: 'If I dwel here, wythout fayle, I gete nought ellys but great trauayle; If that I myght, by Tarmagant, Brynge Iosian to Mambraunt, Ryght welcome shulde I be it tyl And haue I-nough of my wyl!' This Ascaparde, fals was he, For Beuys was fallen in pouerte: Whan a man in pouertye is fal, Fewe frendys meteth he wythal. Forth dyd Beuys and Iosian ryde, Tyl they cam to a forest syde, And Iosyan, that was so mylde, In that wode trauayled of chylde. Beuys and Terry downe gan lyght And wyth theyre swerdes a lodge they dyght And brought Iosian therin, For they coude no better gyn. Syr Beuys dyd hyr seruyce bede, For to helpe hyr at hyr nede; 'Gramarcy, syr,' she sayde, 'nay,' For goddys loue go hens away, Go and sport you wyth Terry And late me worke and our lady: Shal neuer womans pryuete To man be shewed for me!' Beuys and Terry forth went there, For they wolde nat hyr peynes here, But Ascaparde toke another way, On treason thought the thefe ay. After that Beuys was gone hyr fro, She was delyuered of chyldren two. Whan Ascaparde harde this cas, That Iosyan delyuered was, To the lodge went he there, And Iosyan away dyd he bere, There myght no prayer hyr borowe; I wonder, hyr hert brast nat for sorowe, For he sware by Tarmagant, He wolde hyr lede to Mambrant. Whan Beuys had longe taryed, Agayne to the lodge he hym hyed; In the lodge fonde he no mo, But yonge male chyldren two; He wyst nat, what to do nor say, Whan he sowe, Iosyan was away; 'Alas,' than sayde syr Beuys, 'Ascaparde hathe done treason, I-wys!' Syr Beuys fel downe in a traunce, But Terry dyd hym vp enhaunce. Whan Beuys sawe, no better wolde be, His ryche mantel than toke he And wrapped the two chyldren therin, For they were somdel of his kynne. No lenger there wolde he abyde, But toke his chyldren and forthe gan ryde. A foster in the wode he met, And syr Beuys fayre hym gret: 'Felawe,' sayde he to hym than, 'Sawest thou ought of suche a man Lede a woman by any way?' 'Syr,' sayde the foster, 'nay!' 'What maner of man art thou, bache|lere?' 'Syr,' he sayde, 'I am a foster!' 'Wylt thou,' sayde Beuys, 'so Cryst the shylde, Do crysten here an hethen chylde? But ryght nowe was it borne, Ful erly it hathe the moder lorne, And kepe it but this seuen yere, For X marke, and haue it here?' 'Gladly!' sayde the foster tho; He toke the chylde & the golde also. He sayde: 'What shal I cal hym, syr knyght?' Beuys sayde: 'Guy, as my fader hyght; And whan he is of seuen yere, In eche londe do thou enquere After syr Beuys of Hamptowne: My name is so, by my crowne, And brynge the chylde than to me, And wel rewarded shalt thou be!' 'Gladly, syr,' sayde he, 'I-wys!' He went his way & Beuys his. Forthe they rode, so sayth the boke; Another man they ouertoke; They asked, what maner a man was he; He sayde: 'A fyssher of the se!' Than Beuys wyth glad semblaunt Made wyth hym the same couenaunt, That he shulde in the same maner His other son kepe seuen yere. The fyssher graunted as Beuys sayde; He toke the chylde and helde hym apayde. After hym selfe in that whyle He crystened the chylde Myle. Forth rode Beuys bi dale and downe, Tyl he cam to a castel towne; He toke his Inne as a curteys knyght, And vnto souper he hym dyght. Than at a wyndowe as he loked out, He sawe in the strete rounde about Stedes trapped fayre and bryght, Dukes and erles and many a knyght, Out at the wyndowes on euery syde Armes were hanged fayre and wyde. Herodes gan the armes escrye, And therof Beuys maruayled greatly; He asked his oste therof tydynge; 'Syr,' he sayde, 'harde you no thynge Of the great Iustynge, that shal be Tomorowe here in this cyte? The dukes doughter and his eyre, She is a mayden gode and fayre, Hyr fader is nowe nere dede, Therfore it is gyuen hyr to rede, A great iustynge for to crye, And he, that may haue the maystry, Shal thys mayden haue to wyfe And al hyr londe wythouten stryfe! Than sayde Beuys to Terry: 'Shal we iust for that lady?' 'Yes,' sayde Terry, 'god forbede ellys, If it be soth, that he vs tellys!' Beuys gaue that man for his tydynge Of grotes twenty shelynge. On the morowe, whan it was day clere, Than arose bothe knyght and squyer; Fayre tokens dyd they on them throwe, Wherby the lady shulde them knowe. Syr Beuys and syr Terry Armed them ful hastely; Syr Beuys bare of colour poymant (!) A rede lyon of golde rampant. Than forthe rode Terry and he Thyder, where the iustynge shuld be. The fayre lady Helyanour Ouer the castel lay that houre, And al the iustynge she behelde, What knyght hym bare best in the felde. Than these knyghtes began to ryde, Eche at other on euery syde. The fyrst knyght, that Beuys rode agayne, Was themperours son of Almayne, And Beuys at hym bare so fast, That hors and man to grounde he cast. The erle Florens forth gan thrynge Agaynst Beuys wyth great hastynge; Beuys met hym in the felde And hyt hym in myddes of the shelde, That two londe brede and more, He cast hym from his hors thore. Than rode forth the duke Antoyne, That than was duke of Burgoyne; He was stronge and great of pryce, And thus he sayde to syr Beuys: 'Turne the, knyght, and make defence, For I wol venge the erle Florence!' Than wolde Beuys no lenger abyde, But smote Arundel vnder the syde; So harde eyther to other droue, That theyr speres al to-roue. But Beuys so harde to hym thrast, That his shulder bone al to-brast; Therof he was agreued sore, For that day myght he iust nomore. Than rode forth syr Terry To the kynges broder of Hungry And gaue to hym suche a rebowne, That both he and his hors fel downe. Than cam the erle Hamaut And to Terry made a saute, And Terry hyt hym in the shelde, That he bare hym into the felde. There was no knyght, verely, That myght wythstande Beuys nor Terry, But al the knyghtes for great enuy Them two assayled cruelly, And ful narowe them sought, But Beuis of Hampton spared nought; The stywarde of that same londe Beuys cast downe in myddys of the sonde. Than loughe the lady Elyanore For the boste, that he made before, And many Beuys bare thoroughout, That of theyr lyfe they stode in dout. They stynted neuer, tyl it was nyght, That they wanted the day lyght; Than they left of theyr Iustynge, And on the morowe they harde tyd|ynge, That syr Beuys of Hamptowne Had wonne the laude and the re|nowne. Dame Helyanour wolde nat blynne, Tyl Beuys was brought to hyr Inne; She sayde: 'Syr, it is gyuen me to counsayle, Thou shalt me wed, wythouten fayle, Eyther to other terme of lyfe.' 'Nay,' sayde Beuys, 'I haue a wyfe,' And tolde, howe she was stolne hym fro. Than sayde the lady: 'Sythe it is so, Thou shalt al this seuen yere Be my lorde in clene manere, And if thou fynde hyr nat by than, I wyl the haue before any man; And if in that tyme ye fynde your wyfe, I wol none husbonde durynge my lyfe: And loke, Beuys, if I say skyl!' 'Dame,' sayde Beuys, 'I holde me thertyl.' Thus was Beuys hyr gouernour And led that londe in great honour. As Sabere slept on a nyght in bed, Hym thought, that Beuys was bested Wyth Ascaparde, that was his swayne That he had Beuys nerehande slayne. Whan he awaked, his hert was colde, His dreme vnto his wyfe he tolde. 'Syr,' she sayde, 'as I wene, Beuys is brought in some tene; As I trowe, syr, by. my lyfe, He hath lost outher chylde or wyfe, By Ascaparde, that fals thefe, Beuys is brought vnto some grefe.' Than sayde Sabere: 'I shal seke that syre.' Twelue knyghtes he dyd atyre In palmers wede, by saynt Iohn, Wel armed euerychone; They were armed sure and wel Both in yren and in stele. Forthe they went, both more and lesse, Tyl they came to hethenesse. Whan Iosian was nere at Mambraunt, Iesu Cryst he hyr warrant! She met wyth Sabere in the vylage, And sayde: 'Palmer,' in hyr langage, 'I pray you of socour and rede: But ye me helpe, I am but dede.' 'Certys, Iosyan,' sayde Sabere, 'Me lyketh wel, that ye be here, For of you, madame, verament, I shal make Beuys a present.' Than agreued was Ascaparde, For they assayled hym ful harde; They hym beset on euery syde, But there wolde none his dynt abyde. Fro his stroke away they dyd shone And start agayne as knyghtes anone And gaue hym great strokes and sore, For anger he fomed lyke a bore. Than as he smote after a knyght, Syr Sabere ran to hym ful ryght, And wyth his swerde, wythout dout, He bare Ascaparde thoroughout, That he fel dede to the grounde; Glad was Iosyan that stounde. Syr Sabere toke Iosyan, That was as whyte as any swan, Hyr body, that was so fayre and gent, He anoynted wyth an oyntment And made hyr to seme yelowe & grene, That before was fayre and shene, That no man shulde take hyr hym fro, Therfore he discolowred hyr so; And after that Beuys they sought, But tydynges of hym harde they nought. That wol be founde, founde shal be: On a day they went thoroughe the cyte, They ledde Iosyan to hyr Inne, And than he went, some mete to wynne. Sabere went to the castel gate And met his son Terry therat, He prayed hym in the honour of the rode, That he wolde gyue hym some gode. Terry hym behelde blyue And sayde: 'Palmer, so mot I thryue, There shal no mete be the to dere, For thou art lyke my fader Sabere!' Saber sayde: 'By goddys grace, So thy moder sayde, I was.' Whan Terry sawe, that it was he, He ran to hym wyth hert fre; He hym kyssed and asked his fader What caused hym to come thyder. Sabere sayde: 'Son, thou shalt se, What thynge I haue brought wyth me.' Forthe they went togeder in fere, Tyl they to theyr Inne cam nere; Than they bothe wyth gode entent Wasshed away the oyntement; Fayre and wel they hyr dyght And brought hyr to the castel ryght And toke hyr vnto Beuys in honde: He had neuer erste a gladder sonde. Than cam the fyssher & the fostere Wyth theyr chyldren fayre and clere, And for they helde Beuys couenaunt ryght, He made eyther of them a knyght, And than wedded syr Terry, Of that londe that fayre lady; There was a ryche feste, I-wys, On euery syde ioy and blysse. But nowe begynneth a newe tydynge Of kynge Iour and Ermyne kynge. Bytwene them batayle gan they take, And al was for Iosyans sake. A palmer tolde Beuys that tydynge, Therfore syr Beuys al hastynge Sent after great chyualry Of doughty knyghtes and hardy, That he had knowen beforne, And al they were to hym sworne. Than Beuys had gadred his company, He toke his leue at syr Terry, And Terry profered wyth hym to go; But Beuys sayde, he shulde nat so: 'Sabere, thy fader, shal go wyth me; If I nede, I shal sende for the.' Guy and Myles to hors were dyght Wyth stalworth swerdes for to fyght. Than Beuys wyth al his company Went forthe vnto Ermony; Of his comynge the kynge was blythe And asked hym mercy on hundreth sythe And sayde: 'If thou wylt forgyue me, I wyl be crystened for loue of the.' On that couenaunt Beuys gan hym kysse, Thus be they acorded, I-wys. Than anon with oute other dome Than anon ] om. O. oute] any add. O. Beues send to the pope of Rome, pope ] erased in O.
