[ Cambridge University MS, Ff 2. 38.] Sythe \u00fee tyme, \u00feat god was borne And Crystendome was set and sworne, Mane aventewres hathe befalle, That &yogh;yt be not knowen alle; Therfore schulde men mekely herke And thynke gode allwey to wyrke And take ensawmpull be wyse men, That haue before thys tyme ben: Well feyre aventurs befelle them (And sythen scheweyd to mony men), For \u00feat they leuyd MS. originally louyd. in added over the line. in sothefastenes, In grete trauell and in angwysche. Of gode menys lyuys men schulde here And of \u00feer gode dedys sythen lere: He, that myght lerne and holde faste, He schulde wexe wyse at the laste. Hyt ys holdyn grete maystry To holde wysdome and leue folye. \u00b6 Of an Erle y wyll yow telle (Of a better may no man spelle) And of hys stewarde bryght of hewe, That was bothe gode and trewe, And of hys sone, that good squyere, Whyll he was hole and fere, And howe he louyd a may &yogh;ynge, The Erlys doghtur, a swete thynge. \u00b6 The Erle was of Ynglonde And helde Warwyk in hys honde: Ryche he was and of grete myght, Also curtes and a gentyll knyght. He was ryche, wythowten otheys, Of golde and syluyr and many clothys, Of stronge castels and cyteys ryche: In all that londe was none hym lyche, Knyght nor swayne, in no wyse, That durste agenste hym ryse, But \u00feat he toke \u00feem, as thefe felon, And caste them in hys pryson. Well he louyd feyre stedys And gaue gyftys and grete medys; Therfore all men hym dradde And to hym grete loue hadde. Erle he was of grete poste And lorde ouyr that cuntre: Of Oxonford all the blys, Euery daye hyt was hys; Of the Erledame of Bokyngham MS. Bokyngham. Lorde he was and bare the name. Syr Roholde, for sothe, he hyght: He was a nobull man and a wyght. \u00b6 A doghtur he had be hys cowntes, Ther myght no man telle hur feyrenes. Lysten to me: telle y wyll Of hur bewte; for that ys skylle. Whyte sche was, as felde flowre; Hur vysage was of feyre colowre, Longe, small and well farynge; Feyre mowthe and nose syttynge, Feyre forhede and feyre here. Soche a mayde was neuer &yogh;ere, So feyre schapyn and wele dyght: Ioye hyt was to see that syght. Wyse sche was and curtes of mowthe, All the vii arse sche cowthe. Sche had maysturs at hur honde, The wysest men of that londe, And taght hur astronomye, Arsmetryck and gemetrye. That mayde was of grete prys, For sche was bothe warre and wyse. \u00b6 Dewkys, erlys of grete kynne Of mony a londe come hur to wynne: Of them all wolde sche none For the godenes, that was hur on. Wele feyre was that damycell Hur name was Felys la Belle. MS. felysabelle. Of all maydenys sche bare \u00fee MS. \u00fe e flowre: That tyme was none of of over the line. hur honowre. Yf men soght all mankynde, A feyrer maye schall no man fynde. Who so schulde the fayrenes telle, All to longe schulde he dwelle. \u00b6 Now of \u00fee stewarde speke we then, For he was comyn of ryche kynne. A man he was of grete myght: In hys tyme ther was no knyght, Of armes, of strenkyth of honde That bare soche pryse in all \u00feat londe. In Wallyngforde he was borne: All that londe to hym was sworne. He was a man of grete poste: Ther was none bettur on \u00feat halfe \u00fee see. He cowde ynogh of nobull seruyse, Therfore he was of nobull pryce. Ther was noon in all that londe, That durste a&yogh;enste hys lorde stonde, But he batyd anon hys boste Wyth the strenkyth of hys hooste And toke hym wyth folke ynowe, Yf they into Scotlonde flowe. He helde all hys lordys londe Wyth grete honowre vndur hys honde. He made pees, as he wolde: Yf a man were chargyd wyth golde, He schulde fynde no robber hym to reeve, That wolde take oght agenste hys leeue. \u00b6 Segwarde was the stewardys name, A trewe man, wythowten fame: A bettur stewarde had no man. That ylke stewarde had a sone, A feyrer may no man knowe Nodur of hye nor of lowe. Curtes he was and wyse of lore And wel belouyd wyth lesse and more. The Erle Roholde he seruyd than: He was desyryd of many a man. The Erle louyd that squyere, Before all odur he louyd hym dere. Of hys cowpe he seruyd hym on a day, In \u00fee knyghtys chaumbur he laye. Goode he was and bry&yogh;t of hewe: He wolde not hym chawnge for no newe. Gye he hyght of Warwykk: In all \u00fee londe was non hym lyke. Ther was nodur squyer nor kny&yogh;t, But \u00feey hym louyd wyth all \u00feer my&yogh;t, And he \u00feem gafe gyftys wythall, So \u00feat he was louyd of all. Thorow feyrenes and strenky\u00fe allone They honowred hym euerychone. Feyre he was and bryght of face: He schone as bry&yogh;t, as ane glace. Hys kynne was wondur yoyfull \u00fean, That he waxe so feyre a man. Hende he was and mylde of mode: All men speke of hym grete gode. Wyth a swyrde he cowde well pleye And pryck a stede in a weye. Gye had to maystyr a knyght (Syr Harrawde of Ardurne he hy&yogh;t), A nobull knyght and an hardye Full well he taght aye Gye. \u00b6 At Whytsontyde felle a daye, As y yow telle may, The Erle made a grete feste Of lordys of \u00feat londe honeste: Knyghtys, erlys and barons Come thedur fro many townes; Ladyes and maydenys free Come \u00feedur fro mony a cuntre. Knyghtys sate in the halle, Ladyes in the chaumbur alle. When \u00feey were to mete sett, Gye came and \u00fee Erle grett. The Erle clepyd Gye anon (A sylke gowne he had vppon): He badde hym go to chaumbur stylle And serue hys doghtur at hur wylle. Wele he besemed that ylke clothe: To chaumbur forthe anon he goyth. Gye on hys kneys sone hym sett And that maydyn feyre he grett. 'Madame,' he seyde, 'god the see. Thy lorde the gretyth well be me And comawndyd, y schulde, par ma faye, Before the serue thys same daye.' Felys askyd at that case, Who that Gyes fadur was. 'My fadur,' he seyde, 'hyght Seqwarde, That ys thy lordys stewarde.' The mayde seyde: 'Seqwarde ys gode, And so be all, \u00feat be of hys blode.' \u00b6 Than can \u00fee maydyn vp stande And askyd watur to hur hande. The maydenys wysche wythowten lett And to \u00feer mete they ben sett. Gye entendyd all that daye To serue that lady to hur paye. Well hur seruyd yonge syr Gye: There were maydenys thretty, That for hys seruyse in the halle There loue on hym can falle. Therof roght Gye noght: An other loue was in hys thoght. Gye ouyr all louydde Felyce, The Erlys doghtur wyth \u00fee feyre vyce. \u00b6 Aftur \u00fee mete (hyt waxyd nere eve) Gye at \u00fee mayde toke hys leue: To hys inne &yogh;ede Gye, A carefull man and a sorye.", "1": "Nowe sorowede Gye nyght and daye, That he ne wyste, what he do may. He ys full of sorowe and care: Full longe ne may he wele fare. Ofte he began to syke and wepe. He wakenyd ofte, when he schulde slepe: On nyght, when odur men had reste, Then was hys sorowe all preste. When odur lye, \u00feen wyll he stonde: For sorowe \u00feen wryngy\u00fe he hys honde. Loue hath geuyn hym soche a wounde, That he may not wele stonde. Ofte seyde Gye: 'allas, allas,' That euyr he borne was. Hys sorowe hym lastyd day and nyght All that ylke fowrtnyght. Gye ys moche bemoonyd of all In \u00fee Erlys cowrte and in \u00fee Kyngys halle; For he was wonte there to serue Before the Erle hys mete to carve. All, \u00feat \u00feere were, bo\u00fee moost and leeste Of Gye they had a grete breste. \u00b6 When \u00fee feste was broght to ende And lordyngys can home wende, Gye then to cowrte came, A carefull and a sory man. Before the mayde felle Gye adowne And seyde: 'for \u00fey loue y muste dye soone.' The mayde lokyd on Gye full grymme And wele wrothely answeryd hym: 'Art thou not Seqwardes sone Gye? Who made the so folehardye For to assaye me of loue? Be Iesu, that syttyth aboue, And y \u00feys my fadur telle vnto, For \u00feys worde he wyll the sloo, Soone that \u00feou schalt be drawe, On galowse hangyd, and \u00feat ys lawe. On grete folye \u00feou the bethoght, When \u00feou me of loue besoght. Neuer dud man me that vylenye To assaye me of folye. Wende hens owt of my syght, Or \u00feou schalt dye, my trow\u00fee y ply&yogh;t.' \u00b6 When Gye these wordys harde, To hys inne soone he farde. Now begynnyth hys sorowe newe: Ther louyd neuer man &yogh;yt so trewe. Nyght and day he ys in sorowe, Late on euyn, &yogh;arly on morowe. For loue now may he haue no reste: Ofte he desyryd, hys hert schulde breste. Into a chaumbur he ys gone: Ther wyste Qu. was no man, but he allone. There he felle in swownyng downe: The chaumbur was hys grete prisowne. \u00b6 When \u00fee Erle wyste of \u00fee state of Gye, For hym he was sorye: He sende to hym lechys fele Of hys sekenes hym to hele. Out of \u00feem all wyste \u00feer none, What sekenes was hym vppon. The leche was wyse and ware And askyd hym of hys fare. Gye answeryd at that case Not as the sothe was: 'In my hed comyth a colde blode, That maky\u00fe me to qwake, as y were wode. Aftur comyth a stronge hete, That makyth my body for to swete: All y brenne boone and hyde Also hote, as any glede. Thys ys my lyfe nyght and daye: For payne reste y ne maye.' The lecheys cowde hym helpe no&yogh;t, To Iesu they haue hym betaght. Gye leuyd stylle there In sorowe and care, as he was eere. \u00b6 Hyt befelle vppon a daye, Gye to the castell toke \u00fee way. As he romeyd all abowte, He lokyd on a towre wythowte: Therynne was \u00fee maydyn hende, That Gye louyd wythowten mynde. 'Therinne,' he seyde, 'ys \u00feat maye, For whom y morne bo\u00fee ny&yogh;t and day.' Wyth \u00feat worde hys body can bowe, Downe he felle \u00feere in a swowe. He rent hys clo\u00fee, he drewe hys here, Ofte he felle in swownyng there. For loue he waxyd almoste wode: For wo he swett and caste blode. \u00b6 Of swownyng he rose vp than: For sorowe he waxe pale and wan And seyde: '&yogh;yt schall y oonys prove For to wynne \u00feat maydenys loue. Sche may do me no more woo, Then telle hur lorde and do me sloo. Then schall me falle grete honour to, That y for hur to de\u00fee was do. Yf y therfore schall dye to daye, Y wyll hur of loue praye.' Sore he wept and sore he syght: To the castell he hym dyght. \u00b6 As he in the garden wonde, Felyce, \u00feat lady, there he fonde: There sche was almoost allone, Ther was wyth hur maydyns but oon. When Gye Felyce there sye, To hur he ranne all in hye. He felle before hur downe on hys kne And seyde: 'Felyce, haue merce on me. I am to blame now wyth skylle: I am come hedur agenste \u00fey wylle. I may not slepe nyght nor day: So thy loue byndyth me aye. On nyghtys, when odur men slepe, Thou makyst me full sore to wepe. When \u00fey lorde wottyth euery dell, That y loue the so well, Therfore he wyll do me slee: That schall to me grete worschyp be, Yf any man may synge or rede, That y was for \u00fee done to dede, That men may say be many a day, That y was slayne for soche a maye.' \u00b6 When Gye had these wordys seyde, To the grownde he hym leyde. Sche rewyd then on Gyes payne: When sche sawe hym in swownyng layne, Sche bad hur maydyn in \u00feat stownde Arere vp Gye fro the grounde. The maydyn &yogh;ede to Gye thoo And toke hym in hur armes two. To Felyce than sche broght Gye. Felyce seyde to hym: '\u00feou doyst folye. Who gaue the thys ylke redde, That \u00feou for my loue woldest be dedde? Soone schalt \u00feou to dethe be doo.' 'God grawnt,' quod Gye, '\u00feat hyt be soo, That men my&yogh;t saye be ony way, That y was slayne for soche a maye.' Then seyde \u00fee maye, \u00feat toke vp Gye, To Felyce, hur ladye: 'Yf my fadur were kyng or knyght, Erle or emperowre of myght, And he were man poreste And y maydyn feyreste, And he louyd me so derne, Y myght not hym loue werne.' \u00b6 Felyce spake to Gye anone: 'For thy loue y wyll now done, Ther ys no maydyn in \u00feys londe Nor no lady, y vndurstonde, That \u00feou wylt haue to thy wyfe, But \u00feou schalt haue hur, wythowtyn stryfe.' Gye answeryd Felyce there: 'Ys hyt no better, \u00feen hyt was eere. Other, then the, kepe y none: For the y wyll my lyfe forgoon.' \u00b6 When Gye had seyde thys reson, Therwythall he felle downe. Felyce on Gye began to loke And in hur armes hym vp toke. 'Gye,' sche seyde, 'be nowe stylle. Here me, yf hyt be yowre wylle. Knyghtys and erlys y haue forsake, That wolde me to wyfe take. And y loued now a yong take blotted out before knaue in MS. knaue, How schulde y my worschyp save? When \u00feou art dubbed a knyght And proued well in euery fyght, Then, for sothe, hyght y the, That \u00feou schalt haue \u00fee loue of me.' When thys harde Gyeowne, For yoye in swownyng he felle adowne. Felyce spake to hym wyth mowthe And comefortyd hym, as sche well cowthe. He rose vp fro swownyng And toke leue at \u00fee maydyn &yogh;yng. Owt of \u00fee &yogh;arde he went aryght, To hys inne he well sone hym dyght. There he was to \u00fee secunde daye, That hys sekenes went awaye. \u00b6 When Gye had couyrde hys estate, To \u00fee erlys court he toke \u00fee gate. Well feyre Gye the Erle grett, Before hym on hys kneys he hym sett. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y prey the, That \u00feou knyght dubbe me. Yf \u00feou wylt me \u00fee ordur yeue, I wyll the serue, whyll \u00feat y leue.' The Erle grauntyd hym hys boone And seyde: '\u00feou schalt be dubbed soone.' \u00b6 Forthe then yede hym Gye And chase to hym squyers twenty. Into a chaumbur \u00feey be goon, There \u00feey schulde be dubbed ychone. Kyrtyls they had oon of sylke Also whyte, as any mylke. Of gode sylke and of purpull palle Mantels above they caste all. Hosys \u00feey had vppon, but no schone; Barefote they were euerychone. But garlondys \u00feey had of precyous stones And perlys ryche for the noones. When \u00feey were \u00feus ycledde, To a chaumbur the Erle hym yede. A squyer broght newe brondys: They toke \u00fee poyntys in \u00feer hondys. They hangyd on euery swyrde hylte A peyre of sporys newe gylte. Before \u00fee awter \u00feey knelyd ychone, Vnto mydnyght were all goone. The Erle come anon ryghtys And wyth hym two odur knyghtys. The Erle seyde: 'lordyngys dere, At thys nede helpe vs here.' The knyghtys, \u00feat were hende, Knelyd to the awters ende. The Erle, that was the thrydde, Began all in the mydde. At the furste to Gye he come, Of the swyrde \u00fee spurres he nome. He set the spurres on hys fote And knelyd before hym, y wote, And wyth the swyrde he hym gyrte Ryght abowte at hys herte And smote hym on \u00fee neck a lytull wey&yogh;t And bad hym become a good kny&yogh;t. There were hys felowes euerychon Dubbed knyghtys be oon and oon. \u00b6 The Erle at morne a feste made: There were feele lordyngys glade. When \u00fee knyghtys had etyn And at \u00fee borde longe setyn, Vp they rose euerychone: To \u00fee chaumbur be \u00feey goone. Gye hym went anon ryght To Felyce, that swete wyght. He seyde: 'lemman, for thy sake Knyghtys ordur haue y take: For \u00fee y am dubbyd knyght. Do nowe, as \u00feou me hyght.' 'Gye,' sche seyde, 'what wylt \u00feou done? &YOGH;yt haste \u00feou not wonnen \u00fey schone. Of a gode knyghtys mystere Hyt ys the furste manere Wyth some odur gode knyght Odur to juste or to fyght. Goo and do thy cheualrye And \u00feen \u00feou schalt lye me bye: Then \u00feou shalt haue \u00fee loue of me And at \u00fey wylle my body shall be.' \u00b6 Gye toke hys leue of \u00feat maye And to \u00fee halle he toke \u00fee waye. The Erle he fonde in the halle And on hys kneys he can down falle. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'gyf me leeue For to go myselfe to preue. I wyll fare to odur d blotted out before odur in MS. londe Dedes of armes for to fonde.' The Erle spake to Gye stylle: 'Gye,' he seyde, 'take all \u00fey wylle.' Gye toke hys leue \u00feere in \u00fee halle And went owt fro \u00feem all. \u00b6 He wente to hys ynne warde: There was hys fadur Seqwarde. Well sone he set hym on hys kne And seyde: 'fadur, lysten to mee. For sothe, fadur, y yow telle, Noo lengur wyll y here dwelle. Fadur, yf thy wylle bee, Y wyll wende ouyr the see: I wyll preue, sauns fayle, Of turnement and batayle.' 'Sone,' he seyde, '\u00feou art full &yogh;ynge For to preue of soche thynge. &YOGH;yt haste thou no myght To turnament nor to fyght. Lenge at home, pur charyte, Leve soon, y prey the, Tyll \u00feou can more skylle.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'that y do nylle.' 'Sone,' seyde he, 'sythe \u00feou wylt soo, Thou schalt not allone goo. Of my tresure take thy fylle; For hyt ys \u00feyn all at \u00fey wylle.' He gaue hym tresure gret plente And betoke hym knyghtys three, Harrawde, Toralde and Vrrye, And betoke \u00feem hys sone Gye, That they schulde hym kepe wyth \u00feer myght; For \u00feey were bothe hardy and wyght. \u00b6 Gye toke hys fadurs beneson And went forthe of the towne. They harde of a gode schyppe: All iiii theryn they lepe. They drewe sayle, \u00fee wynde was gode, Thay yede into the salte flode. They sayled forthe wythowten ore: The syght of Ynglonde loste \u00feey \u00feore.", "2": "No\u00feyng sawe \u00feey \u00feem abowte, But salte watur and waweys stowte. Forthe \u00feey went be day lyght, Tyll hyt drewe to the nyght. Londe they sye at the laste: Thedurwarde \u00feey drewe faste. They came to londe wyth grete hye And ryden into Normandye. To a cyte they come wyth lyght, There they schulde be all nyght At a burges hows of the towne, That was a man of grete renown. As they at the soper sete (Some dranke and some ete), Gye cowde speke of many a \u00feynge And axyd the gode man tythynge, Yf he harde anythynge Of turnament or of justynge. \u00b6 '&YOGH;ys, for sothe,' seyde \u00fee gode man, 'Of a turnament telle y can. Of Almayn the Emperowre Hath a doghtur of gret valowre, That hath a turnament let crye, The moste, \u00feat euer man sye. Ther ys no knyght in \u00feat cuntre, That ys of grete degree, That of armes anythynge can, But he schall be there than. Ne schall be kny&yogh;t in all Spayne, From hens to \u00fee see of Bretayne, That had louyd any maye &yogh;ynge, But he schall be at that justynge For to do hys proves And to schewe hys hardynes.

Wyth goddys grace, when hyt ys day, We wyll wende on owre way.' He gafe hys oost a gode palfray For hys wordys, \u00feat he dud say. \u00b6 Gye rose in the mornynge And went forthe, wythowt lesynge, And hys odur men ychone, Knyghtys, squyers, oon and oon, That were bolde men in fyght To defende them and wyght, Tyll \u00feey were come to justynge Amonge \u00fee knyghtys in \u00feat mornynge. \u00b6 Now ys Gye come to game, There fele knyghtys be gedurd same. Owt of the lystys rode a knyght, That was feyre, gent and wyght. Gye askyd oon, \u00feat by hym stode, What was \u00feat kny&yogh;t, \u00feat owt \u00feere rode, And he answeryd syr Gye than: 'I schall the telle, as y can. &YOGH;ondyr ys Gayere, an harde swayn, The emperowre sone of Almayn, That ys redy for to play, Yf any knyght come hym to say.' \u00b6 When Gye sye hyt was Gayere, Armed he rode hym nere. Owt of \u00fee lyste he can sone ryde In the place to abyde. Be \u00feat \u00fee knyghtys came same. Now begynneth a newe game: Gayer smote Gye in the felde Wyth hys spere thorow \u00fee schelde, That hys spere brake in two: Gyes hawberk dud not soo. Gye smot Gayer wyth myght, To \u00fee erthe he feele down ryght. Gayers hors he lepe vpon And let hys own awey goon. Tho began Gye to play: He fellyd all, \u00feat stode in hys way. He dud well, wythowten fayle: He toke knyghtys in \u00feat batayle; He brake so many sperys asonder, That eche man of hym had wonder. Was noon so strong a kny&yogh;t, \u00feat he smote, But \u00feat he fell down to hys fote. \u00b6 The felle dewke Oton of Payuye To Gye had grete envye. Wyth pryde he wolde juste wyth Gye: The worse parte come hym bye. Gye smote hym \u00feorow \u00fee schouldur bone: The dewke felle of hys hors anon. \u00b6 There come prykyng dewke Raynere, A bolde knyght wythowten feere, Pressyng on a stede faste: Of Gye was he not agaste. 'Traytur,' he seyde, '\u00feou schalt abye: Why smote \u00feou Oton of Payuye? In euyll tyme \u00feou dedyst hym wronge. He ys my neme, y schall the honge. Here y am, the dewke Raynere: I wyll my neeme awreke here.' 'I wyll,' seyde Gye, 'so mote y the, Furste turne ageyn and juste wyth the.' Gye turned hym and smote faste: Bo\u00fee \u00feer sperys e in sperys effaced. all tobraste. Gye smot Rayner on the schelde, That hyt flewe into the felde, And smote hym downe of hys stede. To hys hors sone he yede: 'Syr dewke, haue here ageyn \u00fey stede. When \u00feou seyst tyme, qwyte me my mede.' And sythen he qwyt hym full well; For he was a knyght gentyll. The dewke vp start all in hye And ranne to Gye smertlye. Syr knyght, telle me beforne: What ys \u00fey name? where were \u00feou borne?' 'Gye of Warwyk, for sothe, y hyght: In Ynglonde was y borne aryght.' \u00b6 Tho came the dewke Louayne, MS. loyane. Wyth Gye he wolde juste fayne. Wyth a scharpe growndyn First n in growndyn effaced. spere He rode to Gye faste there. Gye turned ageyn and of hym had wondur, But sone \u00feer sperys brake in sondur. Faste \u00feey drewe ther bryght brondys And faght togedur wyth bo\u00fee \u00feer hondys. \u00b6 Tho come prekyng Harrawt And to dewke Myrande he made asawte. Of hys hors he hym caste: Hys strenky\u00fe myght no lenger laste; And sythen he smot Waldynere: To \u00fee grownde he fellyd hym there. He bare hym well, as knyght hardy: So dud Toralde and Vrry. \u00b6 Nowe ys \u00fee turnament well stronge: Wyth grete strokys euer amonge Many sperys brake in twoo And many to the erthe can goo. No clerke can on boke rede To telle \u00fee doghtynes of \u00feer dede, But all the men wyth hartys free Haue geuyn Gye the maystree. Gye had the pryce and no nodur That day and ylke the todur. \u00b6 When hyt come to the \u00ferydde day, That all knyghtys went away, Then came the dewke Raynere, An hardy knyght and a stere, fere? And seyde: 'herkyn eche man to me And, yf y amys seye, amende me. Geve me the stedys and the fawcon And \u00fee greyhowndys: wyth gret reson He schall \u00feem haue, \u00feat \u00feem wanne, Of Warwykk Gye, \u00feat doghty man. He, that seyth, hyt ys any odur, I wyll hyt preue, \u00feogh he were my brodur.' And all \u00feey seyde wyth oon assente: 'We graunt wele to yowre yugement.' Thorow \u00fee place \u00feey dud crye To &yogh;ylde that present to syr Gye. \u00b6 Now ys departyd that turnement, And Gye ys to hys ynne went. He dud of hys armowre: He was full wery in \u00feat stowre. Than came a squyer prekynge Hende and wyse and wele spekynge. To Gyes chaumbur he ys gone And gret hym wele feyre anone. 'God \u00fee save,' he seyde, 'syr Gye, Of all \u00fee worlde \u00fee moost worthy. Thou haste \u00fee pryce of \u00feys turnament: Thys present ys to the sente On \u00fee maydenys halfe Blanchflowre, Kyngys doghtur and emperowre, And \u00fee loue of \u00feat maydyn &yogh;ynge, So \u00feou haue no nodur darlynge.' \u00b6 Gye answerde at that tyme: 'Haue \u00feou goddys thanke and myne. I wyll hyt resseyue wyth wyll gode And hur loue wyth well gladder gladde ? mode: I wyll hur serve wyth all my myght Euyr, as hur owne trewe knyght. Felowe,' seyde Gye, 'herkyn to me: Knyght wyll y dubbe the, mee before the blotted out in MS. The, and thy seruawntys thre Schall haue ryche gyftys of me, For ye wolde do thys message: Y schall qwyte yow wele yowre wage.' Than \u00feey seyde all togedur: 'Therfore came we not hedur; But god the &yogh;ylde, \u00feat beste may. We wyll not dwelle, haue gode day We wyll telle Blancheflowre Of thy gyftus and thyn honowre.' \u00b6 The messengere home ys went And lefte there stylle \u00feat present. Two seruauntys Gye can calle And bad \u00feem hye swythe all And take \u00feat present so hende Into Ynglonde for to wende. To \u00fee erle Roholde they schall fare And delyuyr to hym \u00feat present \u00feare And sey, \u00feat Gye hym \u00feat hath sente. When \u00feey harde hys comawndement, Wythowtyn more forthe they rode, Tyll \u00feey were passyd \u00fee see brode. When \u00feey came to Ynglonde, At Warwyk \u00fee erle \u00feey fonde And gaue hym \u00feere \u00feat present And seyde, \u00feat Gye hyt had hym sent, The gerfawcon and \u00fee stedys thre And the greyhowndys feyre and free: As Gye \u00feem wanne, \u00feere \u00feey tolde And how he was bo\u00fee wyght and bolde And how Blancheflowre, \u00feat swete \u00feyng, Let crye and make a grete justynge, That sche myght see in the felde, Who cowde beste welde spere and schylde And whych was the feyrest knyght And in batell beste cowde fyght: He schulde haue thys present And \u00fee loue of \u00feat maydyn gente. When \u00fee erle harde \u00feys tythynge, He was gladde, wythowt lesynge, The first e in lesynge is not quite clear. That Gye was of so grete prys And so ware a man and wys. Hys fadur and hys modur for hys sake Grete yoye dud they make. \u00b6 Nowe wendyth Gye to justynge For to wynne hym preysynge. In Almayn and in Lumbardye, Yn Frawnce and in Normandye\u2014 Ther was no justyng in \u00feat londe, But Gye had the bettur honde. Nowe ys he come wyth gret honowre To Rome to hys harbenyowre. Now spake Harawde, that knyght, Gyes maystyr day and nyght: 'Now wyll we wende to owre contre. We may wele, so mote y the. Into Ynglonde wyll we fare And gete vs loue of kyng Edgare And of all the baronage, That be men of grete parage.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y grawnt wele, That ye sey, euery dele. We wyll to morowe, when hyt ys day, Hye vs faste on owre way.' \u00b6 A gode schypp there \u00feey fonde And sayled ouer bo\u00fee wawe and sonde. Now be \u00feey come to Ynglonde: The kyng \u00feere sone they fonde. The kyng of hym was full gladde And all \u00fee men, that he hadde. Sythen to Warwyk can \u00feey goon: The erle Roholde they fonde anon, That of hym was full blythe And thankyd god fele sythe. Golde and syluyr he wolde hym take, A ryche man he wolde hym make. Hys fadur and modur for hys sake Grete yoye can they make. \u00b6 Nowe ys Gye to Felyce went, On whome all hys loue was lent. He gret hur on hys manere And seyde: 'god loke \u00fee, my lemman dere. I haue for the turned my redde: Yf \u00feou were not, y were but dedde. Ordyr of knyght \u00feou dud me take, And passyd the see for thy sake. Then \u00feou seyde to me wele ryght, When y were a doghty knyght And went far into straunge londe Dedes of armes for to fonde, Then schulde y haue \u00fee loue of the: Therof well gladde wyll y bee. Now am y come to wytt thy wylle, What \u00feou wylt seye lowde or stylle.' \u00b6 Felyce seyde full wysely: 'Haue therof no haste, syr Gye. &YOGH;yt art \u00feou not of soche poste, But ther be bettur in thys contre. Thou art well stronge and wyght, Bolde also in every fyght: Yf y the graunt ouyr all thynge My loue and to be thy derlynge, Thou woldest be so yelowse And of me so amerowse, That \u00feou woldest not \u00fey narmes take: Then wolde \u00fey lose moche slake. That were a grete schame for the To lose \u00fey pryce for \u00fee loue of me. All my \u00feoght y wyll the schowe, MS. schewe. For y wyll, that \u00feou hyt knowe. My love y wyll not the hyght, Or thou be the boldyst knyght, That may be fownde in any londe Of doghtynes and strenckyth of honde, Of euery justyng and stronge stowre Of all the worlde to bere the flowre; And, when \u00feou haste borne \u00fee so euyn, That \u00feer ys no bettur vndur hevyn, All my loue thou schalt haue And \u00feeraftur no lenger crave: All the whyle y am on lyue, Wyll y be thy weddyd wyue.' \u00b6 When Gye harde Felyce speke, Hym \u00feoght, hys hert wolde breke. 'Now wot y wele, \u00feou seydyst not ryght, When \u00feou me furste of loue behyght. The beste schall y neuyr bee, That ys in all crystyante. I schall wende to far londe, More of justyng wyll y fonde. From the dethe y schall not flee: If y dye, hyt ys for thee.' \u00b6 All wepeyng he went awey And toke hys leue at \u00feat may. He ys went to hys oostell, MS. cowncell. There wyll he no lenger dwelle: To the erle he toke hys way. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'haue gode day. I wyll wende on the stronde Ferr into a nodur londe. I wyll put me for\u00fee, as y can, To be knowen a doghty man And be preysed for my prowe, And y wyste, what wey and howe. And ye haue men MS. me. of gret valowre, Moche hyt ys for yowre honowre: Ye schulde be holde the more dere In euery londe bothe ferre and nere.' \u00b6 Than he spake, the erle Rohawt: 'Syr Gye, haste \u00feou any defawte Of golde, of syluyr or or added over the line. of ryche clothe? Or any man ha\u00fe made \u00fee wrothe? Syr Gye, leue \u00feat fowle wylle And leue at home here wyth me stylle. Thou schalt haue, what \u00feou wylt craue: Hawkes, howndys, what \u00feou wylt haue. Wyth howndys we wyll chace dere And wyth hawkes to the ryuere. To dwelle at home ys my cownceyle: MS. cowncell. That may the gretly avayle. In tyme \u00feen may \u00feou passe \u00fee see, Afturwarde, when bettur may bee.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'at thys tyde For nothyng wyll y here abyde. God yow &yogh;ylde, haue gode day.' He toke hys leue and went away. \u00b6 To hys fadur he went full &yogh;are. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y wyll fare To the londe, there y was ere, A whyle for to dwelle there For to wynne me loueyng Bothe of emperowre and of kynge. He, that may do gode dede, He schulde hym force in yowthehede, So \u00feat he may, when he ys oolde, For a doghty man be tolde. The whyle y am a yonge man, I wyll travell, as y can, That men may holde me doghty in elde, When y may not myselfe welde.' \u00b6 'Swete sone, let be thy fare: Thou makest me to haue sorowe and care. Whereto schulde \u00feou passe the see? Hyt ys bettur at home to bee.' Then spake hys modur dere: 'Leef soone, dwelle thou here. Do aftur thy fadurs redde: Hyt wyll the helpe from the dedde. All thys yere thou wyth vs bee And afturward \u00feou passe the see. Thou wottyst, we haue no nodur heyre, But thou, my swete sone dere. Yf \u00feou were deed thore, Heyre schulde we haue no more. Who schulde \u00feen aftur owre day Haue owre londys, yf \u00feou ne may?' 'Fadur,' he seyde, 'god the kepe,' And therwyth he can wepe; 'And my modur dere alsoo: Haue gode day, for y wyll goo.' \u00b6 Now ys Gye goon fro hys kynne, God hym sende ageyne wyth wynne. To the see he ys goon, A gode schyppe there he nome. He passyd the see in hye, Comen he ys to Normandye. Thorowe the londe vtturly He dud grete cheualry. Forthe he went to Bretayne. There were justyngys in Spayne, That he went to turnaye, Whyll he was there, euery day. Now wendyth he fro Spayne, Comen he ys to Almayne. Fro \u00feens he went to Lumbardye, There was grete cheualrye. Thorow hys strenkyth \u00feere he wanne Grete looueyng of many a man. He was large of spendynge: They honowred hym, as a kynge.", "3": "As he come fro a turnement, That was besyde Bonement, He was greuyd swythe sore Of a wounde, \u00feat he had thore. Then bethoght hym the dewke Oton, A grete traytur and a felon, He louyd syr Gye nothynge: He sye hym woundyd at \u00feat justynge. When Oton the sothe harde, That syr Gye not wele farde, He clepyd to hym erle Lambart, A herde knyght and of gode harte, And wyth hym knyghtys fyftene, All bolde men and keene. To the pase he bad them ryde, There syr Gye schulde wende besyde. 'Lordyngys,' seyde the dewke Oton, 'Herkyn all to my reson. &YOGH;e be my men to me plyght, Ye be holdyn to do my ryght, And to do my comawndement, In what stede ye be sente. Goyth belyue and venge mee Of Gye and hys felows three, That ys enturd into my londe: He wyll me brynge warre on honde. He ys woundyd swythe sore, Loke, that he dedde wore. Ye schall be sworne on bokeys gode, That ye schall wende to the wode And kepe that pase ferre and nere, That he passe not on no manere. Ye schall brynge hys owne corse And sloo hys men all wyth force. I schall hym caste in my pryson: For hym schall go no rawnsome. Wyth paynes stronge he schall be dedde: Ther schall be no nodur redde.' \u00b6 'Syr,' they seyde, 'wyth gode wylle Yowre comawndement we schall fulfylle.' Then \u00feey armed them wele Bothe in yron and in steele. To the pase they conne ryde And hyt besett on euery syde. Gye ne wyste of that skathe, That schulde come to hym so rathe. \u00b6 Now Gye came faste rydynge On a mewle wele awmbelynge. He had gret angwysche of hys wounde: Allas, \u00feat he was not hole and sownde. To passe \u00fee watur he went full rathe, But furste he had grete skathe. Then he harde horsys neye, Helmes he sawe bryght on hye. 'Harrawde,' he seyde, 'here ys treson. We be all dedde, be my crowne.' Of the mewle he downe starte And toke hys stede wyth gode herte. All hys harnes he toke well ryght And arrayed hym, as a doghty MS. a doghty a. knyght, And seyde to hys felows all: 'Fyght faste, or we downe falle. Euery man, that ys of myght, Dyght hys body for to fyght. And, yf y may, so mote y the, He schall for\u00feynk, \u00feat comyth to me.' \u00b6 Then seyde Harrawde, \u00feat gode knyght: 'Wende hens: ye may not fyght. He schall for\u00feynk, \u00feat comyth to vs, I swere be swete Ihesus; For we schall kepe thys passage, Thogh we be take wyth gret owtrage. Bettur hyt ys, \u00feat we dyed all, Than ye amonge vs schulde mysfalle.' Gye answeryd anon ryght, As a bolde man and a wyght: 'And all ye dyed, yf hyt so bee, For all \u00feys worlde wolde y not flee.' \u00b6 Wyth that starte vp a Lumbarde: I wott, he was a cowarde. 'Gye,' he seyde, '&yogh;ylde the to me: Be my hedde, hyt schall so bee. I haue sworne to dewke Oton To brynge the to hys pryson, Or thou the water passed wore.' Gye hym hytt and smote sore Thorowe the body wyth the spere, That hys fete myght not hym bere. Another he mett all in hye And he hym smote, wytturly. The hedde wythowte lettynge Flewe of wyth that strykynge. \u00b6 Forthe then came syr Harrawt, To the thrydde he made asawte. He smote hym \u00feorow wyth hys bronde: The herte blode ranne on honde. Then come prekyng syr Toralde, An hardy knyght and a bolde. A Lumbarde there he mett, That the wey hym had besett, Or he ouyr the watur went. A grete stroke he had hym lente, That the crowne wyth the heuydde MS. hedde. Vppon the sonde \u00feere was leuydde. Forthe then come syr Vrry: Ther was fewe there so hardy. Slayne he hath a doghty knyght, For he wolde mayntene vnryght. \u00b6 Nowe begynneth newe batayle: Echon odur faste can assayle Wyth grete strokys vpon scheldys, That \u00fee pecys flewe in the feldys. Of the helmes feyre and bryght There was a rewfull syght. Forthe came the erle Lambarde, An hardy knyght and an harde. Vrry the gode he hath slone And let hym lye and forthe ys gone. When Harrawde sawe \u00feat ylke dede, He ranne to Lambarde a gode spede. He smote hym \u00feorow wyth hys spere: Vrryes dethe he venged there. Then came forthe Hewchon, That was cosyn to dewke Oton. He was an hardy knyght And in euery place stronge and wyght, Toralde now hath he slayne, Therof was not Harrawde fayne. He sawe Toralde falle to grownde: He \u00feoght to venge hym in a stownde. Hym to venge he \u00feoght wele hate: MS. late. Hewchon on \u00fee crowne he smate. To the gyrdull stede hyt wode, That dud Harrawde moche gode. When syr Gayer sawe that dede, That was an hardy knyght at nede, Harrawde he mett and hym dud smyte Wyth a swerde, \u00feat wolde wele byte, Thorow \u00fee body in a stownde, That syr Harrawde felle to grownde. When Gye sawe them dedde all, From hys stede he had nere falle. For sorowe he waxe nere wode: He was so wrothe in hys mode. Gye smote oon of Lumbardye, He rose no more, wytturlye: He clafe hys body in twoo: The ton syde from \u00fee todur can goo. \u00b6 Gye ys now euyll befalle: Lorne he hath hys felows all. He can syke and sore grone: He wyste not, to whom to make hys moone. All were slayne of \u00feem, but two, And they abowte syr Gye can goo. Gye smote oon of tho Hys rygge bone euyn in twoo. Tho start forthe Segwarde, A full felle Lumbarde. 'Gye,' he seyde, '&yogh;ylde the; For hyt so full wele may bee. I see, \u00feou mayst no lenger stonde For to fyght wyth thyn honde. I see now thy gode schelde: The pecys lye in the felde, Thy helme on that odur syde. Blody be \u00fey wowndys wyde. I may see well be thy chere, Fyght mayste thou no lengere. I schall \u00fee brynge to dewke Oton: He schall \u00fee caste in hys pryson.' \u00b6 'Nay,' seyde Gye, 'so mote y thryue, Neuer, whyll y am on lyue. Ne schall y wyth the dewke carpe, The whyle y haue spere so scharpe And whyll y haue so moche force In my hondys and my corse. The whyle y may defende me, Schall y neuyr &yogh;ylde me to the.' \u00b6 Segwarde smote then Gye, As knyght bolde and hardye. On the helme he smote syr Gye: In fowre pecys hyt went, wytturly. Wyth the grace of heuyn kynge Hymselfe had no hurtynge. When Gye hym felyd smeten sore, To &yogh;ylde hyt hym he was yore. He start to hym wyth gret force And hyt hym egurly on the corce. The schoulder fro the body well He smote of euery dell. Segwarde fledde faste awey From syr Gye wyth grete derey. Gye hym sone turned ageyne To hys felows, \u00feat were slayne. Segwarde prekyth to Payuye All wowndyd and blody. \u00b6 As the dewke came from huntynge And odur men oolde and &yogh;ynge, He sawe a knyght rydynge: Hys ryght arme was mysfarynge. The dewke stode stylle and hym be\u00feoght To here, what tydyngys he had broght: 'Hyt semeth well a woundyd man.' Segwarde hym hyed faste than. 'Sey,' quod the dewke, 'art \u00feou wrathe? Who hath done the that skathe? Where ys Gye? ys he tane? And hys men, be they slane?' MS. slayne. \u00b6 Segwarde seyde: 'y wyll the say Also moche of Gye, as y may. At the ryver we hym mett And we hym all abowte sett. We slewe all of hys men, But hymselfe skapyd then. My felows be slayne to grownde And y myselfe bere dedly wounde.' 'Where ys he, syr Hewchon?' 'Dedde,' seyde Segwarde, 'be my crowne.' 'And the erle Lambarde the goode?' 'I lefte hym sprawlyng in hys blode.' When \u00fee dewke harde hym so sey, 'Allas,' he seyde, 'and wele awey For my men, that be spylte: All hyt ys my nowne gylte.' \u00b6 Now ys Gye comen there, As hys men slayne were. 'Allas,' seyde Gye, '\u00feat y was borre, My gode men \u00feat \u00feus be lorne.' In the stedd, \u00feere Gye stode, He sawe the bodyes Something blotted out before bodyes in MS. lye in blode. When he sawe \u00fee bodyes colde Of \u00fee knyghtys, \u00feat were so bolde, 'Allas,' he seyde, 'and wele away, That euer y wakenyd on \u00feys day. Jesu Cryste, what ys my redde? For my loue \u00feese men be dedde. Sory wordys were me lente, To serue Felyce when y was sente. Felyce,' he seyde, 'for thy sake To vs ys comen moche wrake, And all for the loue of the Dedde be here knyghtys thre. They were \u00fee beste in euery londe, That myght bere s blotted out before bere in MS. spere on honde. Me \u00feynkyth,' he seyde, 'y am a fole, When y to a woman make soche dole. I am not \u00fee furste nodur \u00fee laste, That \u00feorowe a woman downe ys caste; Nothur be two, nothur be three, All wyse men be ware be me. Here haue y loste Harrowde, a nobull kny&yogh;t, That was bolde bothe day and nyght. Who schall me helpe, when y haue drede? Thou were redy in all my nede. I may not on no manere Parte fro the, thou art my fere. Y wolde, y were dedde and leyde on beere: Allas,' he seyde, '\u00feat hyt so were! Hangyd be the Lumbardes, That be so fowle cowardes, That y ne were wyth the slone! Why haue \u00feey lefte me allone? \u00b6 A,' he seyde, 'erle Rohawte, Of thy cowncell y haue defawte. Had y restyd a whyle wyth the And aftur that passyd the see, Soche sorowe vndur a wode syde For no\u00feyng schulde haue me betyde. He, \u00feat wyll not hys fadur here Nodur \u00fee cowncell of hys modur dere, Hyt schall hym nothynge avayle. I haue hyt preuyd, wythowten fayle, For \u00fee sorowe and for the care Of my felows, \u00feat now dedde are, And for my wounde, \u00feat ys so wyde, Well depe on euery syde.' \u00b6 To \u00fee erthe he felle downe And smete in a grete swowne. When he rose of swownynge, He began hys hondys to wrynge. Of hys felows, \u00feat were dedde, Then cowde he no nodur redde, But toke hys hors sone anon And to an hermytage he can goon. 'Ermyte,' he seyde, 'come wyth me (Thys horse of pryce y geue the) And take vp bodyes tweyne, That in \u00fee wode lye slayne, And bery \u00feem wyth moche honowre; For \u00feey were of grete valowre.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y come ryght nowe. Go before, y wyll sewe yow.' Gye hath hym \u00fee bodyes tane Of Toralde and of Vrry than. Sythen he ys lopen on hys stede: He wyth hym Harrawde dud lede. \u00b6 Gye wendy\u00fe now from \u00feat place, There he had a febull grace. The body of Harrawde wyth hym he bare And lefte the odur corsys thare. He went to an abbey, That was a lytull besyde \u00fee wey. The abbot sone he fonde there And spake to hym on hys manere: 'God, \u00feat dyed on a tree, Sur,' he seyde, 'saue the. I the bydde pur charyte In the name of the trynyte, That \u00feou take thys body here And bery hyt on all manere. He was to day a doghty knyght And ryght now was slayne in fyght. God wyll &yogh;ylde the thy mede And y schall, when y may spede.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'wyth full gode chere Schall y bery thys body here. Syr,' he seyde, 'what ys \u00fey name? Telle \u00feou me and, fro whens \u00feou came.' 'I am a knyght of straunge lande. To day, as y come rydande, There theuys come MS. to me. syxtene, Bolde men and also kene. Lefte y am myselfe allone: All my felows haue \u00feey slone. I myselfe haue woundys wyde, Well depe in the ryght syde.' Gye turned fro the abbey And hyed faste on hys wey. To an ermyte MS. ermytage. he can wende, That \u00feerebefore had be hys frende. There he had helyd hys wounde Well sone in a lytull stounde. The dewke Oton was full woo, That syr Gye was passyd soo. \u00b6 The abbot had grete pyte Of \u00feat knyght feyre and free. He let bere hym yn sone: In a chaumbur was he done. Whyll he in the chaumbur laye, Ther come oon of that abbaye, A man, \u00feat was gode and trewe: Of all wowndys, for so\u00fee, he knewe. There he knelyd, wytturly, And lokyd hys woundys and see \u00feem bye, That he had no dedly wounde. He seyde: 'y schall in a lytull stownde Make thys knyght hole and fere.' Therto he dud hys powere And, as he seyde, so dud he, As ye schall here aftur of me. \u00b6 Now ys Gye hole of hys sare And aftur broght owt of hys care. The ermyte he yaue gode day And to Pole he toke the way. There he went to the kynge, That had grete yoye of hys comyng. Syluyr and golde he had hym sente: Thereof had Gye no talente. So had Gye taryed thore, That all hym louyd, \u00feat \u00feere wore, And of euery justynge Wyth hym ys lefte the preysynge. \u00b6 Leue of \u00fee kynge Gye toke anon And to Sesoyne MS.

He clepyd to hym the palmere And spake to hym on hys manere: 'Gode man,' seyde Gye, 'telle \u00feou me, Fro whens \u00feou came and fro what cuntre.' 'Fro Lumbardy comyn y am.

'Gye he hyght of Warwyke: In all \u00feys worlde ys none hym lyke.' Gye began to syke sore. When \u00fee palmer had seyde thore, 'Gode man,' he seyde, 'what ys \u00fey name?

He sawe men renne same: He \u00feoght be \u00feem, hyt was no game. Scheldys and sperys he sawe \u00feem bere, Ryght as hyt were to the were. Gye sone clepyd a man: 'What men,' he seyde, 'be &yogh;one? Telle me, pur charyte, Why ys thys haste in thys cyte?' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'be thys day, Y schall the the sothe say.

Gye thedurwarde dud ryde, There the steward dud abyde. \u00b6 When the steward sawe Gye, Stowtly he can hym hye. He began to make deraye And to hys felows dud he say: 'Yondur cometh hedur a knyght, That ys redy for to fyght. He hath an hors of grete pryce: He schall not longe, y trowe, be hys. God delyuyr me neuyr of synne, But y that horse soone wynne.' \u00b6 He prekyd to juste wyth Gye, As a bolde man and an hardye. Bothe they strekyn faste: They mett togedur at the laste.

Or they were fro \u00fee felde ladde, Many of them \u00fee dethe had. Now came Gye ageyn wyth game And all hys felows hym wyth same. He smytyth \u00fee Almayns sare: For nothynge wolde he spare. \u00b6 All the men of that cyte That batell myght beholde and see. They went and armed them styllo Bothe in yron and in stele. Owt of the cyte can they wende Gye to helpe, as men hende. There men myght see strokys vnryde MS. strokys ryde.

There men myght see knyghtys crye And falle downe fro \u00feer horsys on hye, That were woundyd swythe sore. Ther dyed many men thore. There was dedde in a throwe Fyve hundurde on a rowe. Faste peyned hym syr Gye: So dud Harrawde, wytterlye. The Almayns were ouyrcome, Some slayne and some nome. Wele had Gye spedd that day: So may all that eyte say. The Almayns be scowmfett Wythowte any more lett. \u00b6 Now ys Gye turned ageyne: Of hys dede he was fayne. He and hys felows redde, Ryche prysoners wyth \u00feem ledde. To hys ynne ys he gone, He and hys felows euery oon. Bolde \u00feey were, sawns fayle; For \u00feey had wonne the batayle. Gye restyd hym a thrawe: All hys armvr he dud of drawe. \u00b6 When \u00fee dewke herde tythyng, He was then a yolye thynge. When he wyste, \u00feat Gye was come, The men slayne and \u00fee steward nome, He lepe on a palfraye, To Gyes chaumbur he toke \u00fee way. He gret hym on feyre manere, For hys comyng he made gode chere. 'Welcome,' he seyde, 'syr Gye, And \u00fey felows, sekyrlye. Now y wene to vengyd be On myn enmyes, \u00feat hate me. They warre on me day and nyght: That ys all wythowte ryght. Syr Gye, y geue \u00fee all myn honowre Of my castell and my towre And also of all my londe, My men to serue the to \u00fey honde.

Y schall yow helpe wyth all my myght Wyth gode cowncell to venge the ryght.' \u00b6 He hath yeuyn hym hys powere Of all, that he hath far and nere, He hath geuyn Gye into hys honde And made hym lorde ouyr hys londe. He wenyth be hys cownceyle MS. cowncell. To acorde wyth \u00fee emperowre, sawns fayle. There they spake togedur stylle, How \u00feey myght gete ther wylle. \u00b6 Gye sendyth now a messengere, That was queynt on hys manere: He sent into many a dyuers londe, There he had bee before honde: Knyghtys v hundurd, y vndurstonde, There come to hym fro many a londe.

And how he had hys men slane, MS. slayne. He had grete sorowe and care For hys men, that dedde ware. 'Lordyngys, what ys yowre redde Of owre knyghtys, that be dedde? I schall be neuyr glad nor blythe, Or y be vengyd on hym swythe.' \u00b6 'Syr,' seyde dewke Oton of Payuye, 'Let be thyn yre and thyn envye. Or hyt be passyd dayes thre, Vengyd wele schalt thou bee. Ye schall take yowre baronage And odur men, \u00feat wyll take wage. Of Sesoyne MS. Sesyone. the dewke Raynere And the constable Waldynere And y schall come to yow in hye And brynge grete cheualrye.

Thou haste me geue cownceyle, MS. cowncell. I wene, hyt schall me avayle. Syr,' he seyde, 'make the &yogh;are To the constable to fare And to the dewke of Payuye Wyth hys grete cheualrye: To Argone ye schall in hye And take the dewke and Gye. Yf ye may do that ylke dede, I schall the helpe at all nede.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'wyth gode entente We schall do thy comawndement.' \u00b6 Now haue \u00feey ther leue tane, To ther innes be they gone. On the morne, when hyt was day, Vp \u00feey rose and went ther way, All the captens wyth moche ooste. All they wente: they made boste. To the cyte they came bolde, Twenty hundurde scheldys tolde. \u00b6 When they sye in that cyte Men wythowte grete plente, The bellus faste dud they rynge. I wote, they made no dwellynge: They armed them, as Gye badde, Euery man, that harnes hadde. When \u00feey were come to syr Gye, To fyght they were redy The dewke clepyd Gye there And bad, yf hys wylle were, That Harrawde schulde haue wyth hym eche dell Fyve hundurde knyghtys armed well And wende forthe, wythowte fayle, Boldely them for to assayle, 'And ye, syr Gye, a thousande Bolde men and wele bydande: And, yf he haue mystere. Helpe hym wyth gode chere. And y wyll come wyth my mayne Faste prekynge aftur the. We MS. Ye. schall so wyth them fyght Wyth goddys grace and owre myght, That we schall haue the maystrye.' 'Thou seyest wele,' seyde Gye. 1793 after 1794 in MS. 'Wendyth forthe for to fonde: For nothynge wyll we wonde To helpe the in thys stowre For to holde vp thyn honowre.' \u00b6 When he to the churche came, Oton was the furste man That he sawe in batayle, For sothe wythowten fayle. Harrowde, he \u00feoght furste to assay The felle dewke Oton of Payuaye. 1804-1810, see the note. 'Thynkyst thou not of thy velonye, That \u00feou duddyst my lorde and me In Lumbardye, thy nowne contray? We schall be venged wele to day Wyth goddys grace: yf \u00feat y y omitted in MS. may, Wyth my handys y schall assay.' \u00b6 Now they smyte faste in same: I wot, ther was but lytull game. Betwene \u00feem was lytull play: They drewe swerdys, as y say. Grete batell \u00feere men myght see: Nother wolde fro odur flee. He smote dewke Oton \u00feere so faste, That he felle downe at \u00fee laste. Soone he had hym slayne thare, But hys men came full yare And socowrde hym, wytterlye, Or ellys he hadde dedde bee. Then came hys men wyth my&yogh;t and mayn And set the dewke on hors agayn. \u00b6 Then began a grete batayle: Echon odur faste can assayle. He peyned hym faste, syr Harrawt: To the dewke he made assawt. An hundurd he slewe, sawns fayle, That belefte dedde in \u00feat batayle. The dewkes herte was full sore, When he sawe hys men lye thore: He began faste to crye And seyde: 'ye do velanye. Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'what do ye nowe? Styr ye nowe for yowre prowe. Se ye not thys traytowre, That doyth me thys dyshonowre? He hath slayne my men goode: They lye sprawlande in \u00feer blode. But y be venged on that thefe, Schall ye neuer be to me lefe.' \u00b6 Then \u00feey gedurde on a hepe And abowte they dudde lepe. Grete angwysche ys Harrawde beforne, Now he ha\u00fe of hys felows lorne. But he gate helpe, y vndurstande, For grete socowre came hym on hande. All \u00feey MS. \u00fee. chacyd hym at the laste: Then came Gye rydynge faste. He mett hym faste fleande: Hys spere was brokyn in hys hande And hys hors woundyd on the knee, That vnnethe goo myght hee. Then seyde Gye: 'turne ageyne. Where be \u00fey men? be \u00feey slayne?' 'Nay,' seyde he, 'y vndurstande: I lefte them faste fyghtande.' Gye beganne on hym to crye: 'Harrawde, come on smertlye.' \u00b6 When Gye sye dewke Oton, Soone he schewyd hys reson: 'Dewke,' he seyde, '\u00feynkyst \u00feou noght Of \u00fee treson, that \u00feou me wroght? At the pase of thy foreste In Lumbardy, \u00feere \u00feou myght beste, Thou slewe my men wyth sorowe and care, And y myselfe was woundyd thare. So god me helpe, \u00feys same day I schall the &yogh;ylde, yf \u00feat y may. I the warne, wyth all my myght Here y wyll wyth the fyght. I schall neuer be gladde nor blythe, Or y be vengyd on the swythe.' \u00b6 Gye turned the hedde of hys stede. They faght togedur gode spede. They smeten so faste on \u00feer sheldes, That \u00fee pecys flewe in \u00fee feldes. The dewke smote so syr Gye On the schelde smertlye, That hys spere flewe in thre. 'For god,' seyde he, he and \u00feou omitted in MS. '\u00feou hyttest me All wyth myght and wyth mayne.' Gye turned hym agayne. There he wolde haue had hys heuydde, MS. hedde. But sone he was fro hym reevyd Wyth an hundurde knyghtys tolde, That were hardy men and bolde. All \u00feey went abowte Gyone, But he defendyd hym, as a lyon. \u00b6 Gye cowmfortyd hys felawe To do wele a lytull thrawe. Now \u00feey smyten faste samen: I wot, ther was lytull gamen. Many knyghtys \u00feere dyed \u00feat day And in \u00feat place full lowe lay. Gye hym payned that day soo To take Lumbardes and to sloo; For he wolde vengyd bee On the dewke and hys mayne. Gye dud wele that ylke day And all hys men wythowte delay And slewe \u00fee Lumbardes on euery syde Wyth swerdys and wyth sperys vnryde. Thorow Gye they be ouercome, Many slayne and many nome. They flewe awey, Gye dud \u00feem chace; Of dedde men was full the place. \u00b6 Then came the dewke Raynere And the constabull Waldynere And wyth them grete company. In a vale they sawe syr Gye And faste to hym can they hye Wyth full grete envye. Gye drewe to an hylle And all hys men wyth gode wylle.", "5": "'Lordyngys,' seyde Gye, 'herkeny\u00fe me, The ylke men, \u00feat ye MS. y. yonder see, Ys the dewke of Cesoyne MS. Cesyone.

Helpe hym euyr god, that ys bolde, Whyll he may stonde and wepon holde.' \u00b6 Now they wente in hye, Gye and hys companye. There beganne a grete batayle: Euery man odur faste can assayle. Or the battell endyd were, Many a stronge knyght dyed there. Gye smote the dewke Raynere: Of hys stede he dud hym bere. He hyt a nodur in a stownde, That he felle to the grownde: Thorow \u00fee body he hym smote, He rose no more, wele y wote. Than he smote Waldynere Owt of hys schelde a quartere. From hys sadull downe he starte: I wot, Waldynere hyt dud smerte. Another knyght he sloo tyte Wyth hys swyrde, \u00feat wolde byte. Then forthe came Gylmyne, The dewke Segwyns cosyn. The erle smote abowte faste, But Gye of hys hors hym caste. Gye peyned hym wele to do And all hys men dud also. Of \u00fee Almayns \u00feey haue tane, Many woundyd and many slane. When he sawe dewke Raynere And the constabull Waldynere, How \u00feer men were broght to grownde Wyth grete yre yn a stownde, Gye beganne to crye in hye: '&YOGH;elde yowreselfe or ye dye.' Than he hyed full faste: Them to sloo he was full preste. For no\u00feyng \u00feey wolde flee, And Gye faght full boldele. Of \u00feer men he slewe many: To grownde \u00feey wente sodenly. \u00b6 Then came dewke Raynere To mete wyth Gylmyn, \u00feat was full fere. He hath hym smeten \u00feorow \u00fee syde And gaue hym a wounde longe and wyde. Gylmyn flewe at the laste On hys stede swythe faste. To dewke Segwyne he ys gone: The dewke hym knewe and \u00feat anon. Hys herte was full sare, When he sye Gylmyn so fare. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'ye do grete wronge, That ye dwelle here so longe. Go and helpe thy men tyte: They be in poynt to be scowmfyte.' \u00b6 When the dewke harde \u00fee tythyng, That syr Gylmyne dud brynge, He smote \u00fee stede wyth \u00fee sporys And spared nother dyke nor forys MS. forows. And seyde: 'lordyngys, haue in yowre \u00feo&yogh;t, That owre men \u00feus dye noght. Yf \u00feey \u00feus be be omitted in MS. slayne and tane, We bene dedde euery man.' Than \u00feey wendyd MS. wendyd a grete in \u00feat case. in \u00feat case To helpe Gye a grete pase. \u00b6 Nowe came the dewke faste rydynge And the Almayns faste smytynge. He smote a knyght in that tyde: Into the body hyt can glyde. Or he to Gye wanne, He hedyd many a doghty man. Now \u00feey be mette thare, To fyght \u00feey were full &yogh;are Wyth the Almayns anon ryght Wyth scheldys, sperys and myght. They schett bothe sperys and dartes: Faste \u00feey faght on bothe partes. Hawberkys \u00feey brake and styffe scheldes And made to flye into \u00fee feldus: Hondes and armes \u00feey leuyd there, Fete, schankys, schelde and spere. Wele gode knyghtys many oon, In the felde \u00feey were slone. They were ryche menys sonnes, All they were feyre gromes, That \u00feedur came lose to wynne. Hyt was bothe grete shame and synne: There fadurs be not well lykynge, When \u00feey harde of \u00feat tythynge. \u00b6 For\u00fee \u00feen came dewke Raynere. Slayne he hath Gawtere, That was to Gye a trewe frende Owtetakyn Harrawde \u00fee hende. Gye hyt sawe and was woo: The dewke to smyte he can goo. He smote hym hye vppon \u00fee crowne, That he felle fro hys hors downe. Gye dud, as an hardy knyght, And toke hym \u00feere wyth strenky\u00fee of fy&yogh;t. Than hys swyrde he owte hynte And gaue many an euyll dynte. Gye toke in that stowre An hundurd men of grete valowre. \u00b6 The dewke Segwyne \u00feo stert owte On a gode stede and a stowte. Syr Waldynere \u00feere he dud smyte, That he felle from hys hors tyte. He hath hym take wyth myght: Bothe were woundyd in \u00feat fyght. Now be \u00fee Lumbardes take be tale And \u00fee Almayns slayne alle. The dewke and Gye dud \u00feem chace: Of dedde men was full \u00fee place. \u00b6 Tho came Tyrrye of Gormoyse Wyth grete pryde and moche noyse Wyth an hundurde of gode knyghtys, That were armed at all ryghtys. They were comyn wyth lawnce and spere For to helpe the Almayns there. As \u00fee Almayns awey rode, Tyrrye \u00feem mett, and \u00feey abode. 'Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'wyll ye flee? Turne ageyne and stonde be me. Fyght ageyne yowre enmyse And let be yowre cowardyse, Or y schall telle the emperowre, That ye do hym \u00feat dyshonowre. Yf ye haue be ferde afore hande, Turne ageyne: y wyll be yowre warante.' He made \u00feem to turne ageyne \u00fean: Newe batell they beganne. \u00b6 The dewke Segwyne came full faste: For no\u00feynge wolde he be laste. To an Almayne tho he starte And smote hym streyght to \u00fee harte. When Tyrrye sawe hym dedde, He cowde than no bettur redde, But to dewke Segwyn he caste A grete strook at the laste. The dewke hym turned on hys manere And faght ageyne wyth gode chere. They two faght togedur wele Wyth gode swerdys, were made of stele. Tho came Harrowde on hys stede, That was a gode knyght at euery nede. Wyth a swyrde oon he smote That he felle downe at hys fote. \u00b6 That sawe the erle Tyrrye, A gode knyght and an hardye. Harrawde to smyte sone he yede: He made hym to falle downe in \u00feat stede. Aftur hys folke he dud crye: The Almayns come hastylye. The dewke Segwyne \u00feey sorowe wroght And hys men to dethe broght. Wyth strenkyth \u00feey were dreuyn ageyne, Many woundyd and many slayne. \u00b6 When he sawe, the dewke Segwyne, He was wrothe, be seynt Martyne, And all in hys wra\u00fee seyde to Gye: 'Thys ys grete schame, wytterlye, When \u00feus allone \u00feat oon knyght Schulde vs do that onryght.' Gye hym answeryd, sawnce fayle: 'Turne ageyne, yf hym batayle. Hyt ys bettur slayne to be, Then cowardely awey to flee.' \u00b6 They leyde \u00fee Almayns so vppon, That they gaf back euerychon. Ageynste \u00feem rydyth Tyrrye And makyth many a man blody. When Tyrrye sawe syr Gye, He rode to hym, as knyght hardye. He wende Gye to haue slayne, But he was turned soone agayne. Betwene \u00feem two was grete fyght: Gye hym turned, as an hardy knyght. They smote togedur so faste, That there sperys all tobraste. Than \u00feey toke \u00feer bryght brondys And faght togedur wyth \u00feer hondys. Gye claue hys helme and hys schelde, That \u00fee pecys lay in the felde. Tyrrye smote to Gye a stroke: As god wolde, hys swyrde broke. Sone Tyrrye turned hys stede And fledde faste, as he had nede: Full dere had that stroke be boght, Had he there dwellyd oght. The Almayns flewe wyth \u00feer brondys Bryght drawen in ther hondys. \u00b6 The dewke Segwyne, for sothe y say, To \u00fee cyte he toke \u00fee waye. Syr Gye of Warwyk wyth hym ys gone And hys men euerychone. Dewkys, erlys and barons They broght wyth \u00feem to \u00feer prysouns. All, that in the cyte were, Thankyd god wyth gode chere. \u00b6 Now be \u00feey to \u00feer ynnes wente Euery man wyth gode entente And thankyd god in \u00feat place, That had sente \u00feem soche grace. The dewke ys went vnto hys towre: The prysoners he lokyd wyth moche honowre, The dewke Raynere of Sesoyne MS. Sesyone. And the erle Waldynere of Coloyne MS. Coleyne. And Gawter, the stewarde, That was a nobull man and a harde: He let serue them full tyte, Or he wolde any mossel byte. \u00b6 The dewke to hys systur can say, That was gente and a feyre maye: 'The ryche prysoners \u00feou here take, Well at ese \u00feou \u00feem make: Of all \u00feynge the dewke Raynere; For he ys me bothe leue and dere.' 'Syr,' sche seyde tho full ryght, 'I schall hym serue wyth all my myght.' \u00b6 The ryche emperowre Raynere Wottyth not of thys comberere. He ne wyste of thys tythyng: He pleyed at \u00fee chesses wyth a kynge. Tho came Tyrrye faste prekande And hys swerde brokyn in hys hande: Hys schelde was brokyn, y wene, In the fyght, there he had bene. The bryght helme was croked downe Vnto \u00fee mydward of hys crowne. The blode ranne downe fro hys syde: He had grete woundys and wyde. \u00b6 'Syr emperowre, vndurstande \u00feys \u00feynge: I schall \u00fee telle newe tythynge. Thy barons, that were so wyght, Thou schalt \u00feem neuer see wyth syght. Some be in the felde slane MS. slayne. And some vnto pryson tane. Takyn ys the dewke Raynere And of Coloyne MS. Coleyne. the erle Waldynere. The dewke Oton ha\u00fee a wounde wyde Wyth a spere thorow the syde: Of hys dethe he hath drede, He wenyth neuer to ryde on stede.' \u00b6 The emperowre harde full well, That Tyrrye seyde, euery dell. He ys so sory for that dede, That for sorowe hys herte dud blede. He ha\u00fee holdyn vp hys hande And sworne be god all weldande, That he schall neuer yoyfull bee, Or he haue that cyte And also the traytowrs tane And wyth jugement \u00feem slane. MS. slayne. \u00b6 He let the comyn belle rynge: Hys men came wythowte dwellynge. Sythen he partyd hys grete ooste: To fyght made \u00feey grete boste. They ouyrspradde all \u00fee feldys Wyth spere, hawberk and wyth scheldys. To the cyte they be wente. Yonge Gayer \u00feey haue sente Wyth fyve hundurde knyghtys wyght: They were redy for to fyght. Than the men of that cyte All the Almayns dud see. The cuntre of \u00feem was made lyght Wyth scheldys and wyth helmes bryght. \u00b6 Then came the dewke Segwyne ryght b blotted out before ryght in MS. Armed on a rabett wyght bryght blotted out before wyght in MS. And seyde: 'Gye, gyf me \u00fey cownceyle: Wyll we the yonder men assayle? Or we wyll the walles kepe: The sekyrlyar may we slepe.' 'Syr,' seyde Gye, 'y schall the saye Gode cowncell, yf y maye: An hundurde knyghtys we schall take And a sawte we schall \u00feem make. Yonder y see stonde nere The emperowres sone Gayere And wyth hym grete companye of knyghtys Armed wele at all ryghtys. They be wente before the ooste All for pryde and for boste. Yf we haue the wars syde, Into the cyte wyll we ryde.' \u00b6 Nowe be \u00feey an hundurde bolde Wyght men and wele of tolde. They wente, wythowten fayle, Syr Gayer to assayle. Of all \u00fee Almayns \u00feey wyll be wreke: Of no corde wyll they speke. To fyght they begynne faste: Some were of \u00feer horsys caste. Gye smote Gayer there: Of hys hors he dud hym bere. There he was take wyth myght and mayne. Hys men flewe to the ooste agayne: So were they chaced at the laste, That ther hertys almoste braste. Some were woundyd and some tane And some scaped and some slane. MS. slayne. \u00b6 When the ooste sye ther men So faste toward them renne And wyste also, that Gayere Was takyn, wyth euyll chere They hastyd them swythe The dewke to brynge owt of lyue. Than beganne a grete fyght: Knyghtys many dyed ryght. Grete lore was thore, But the dewke had the more. He hath lorne many of hys men: They were awey ladde then. The dewke passed myles thre From hys men and hys cyte, But neuer the lees \u00feey dud well, And so dud Gye, as haue y hele. And wyth hym was Harrawte, In batell dud neuyr defawte. \u00b6 Then came prekynge Tyrrye, A bolde knyght and an hardye. He hath smetyn \u00fee dewke Segwyne: Hys hors he made hym for to tyne. The dewke starte on fote: He sawe no nodur bote. He drewe hys swerde wyth myght And defendyd hym, as a knyght. Ther was no man, he myght come to, But full sone he wolde hym sloo. Tyrrye assayed the dewke than: He hym defendyd, as a man. The Almayns come on euery syde Wyth scheldys and speres vnryde. He ys woundyd ylle and sore: Men wende, he schulde lyue MS. lye. no more. \u00b6 When Gye sye hym haue care, Ther was none, \u00feat he wold spare, Nor none, that he myght reche, That had nede of odur leche. Than he smote a doghty knyght: Of hys hors he made hym to lyght. He had hym smetyn swythe sore, That he rose vp no more. Hys gode swerde he drewe owte And smote all, that stode abowte, To helpe \u00fee dewke fro them away: Many a man he slewe that day. \u00b6 Than spake syr Gyowne: 'Dewke, herkyn to my resone. To the cyte wyll we fare: We may defende vs no mare. Fyve hundurd knyghtys be redy To fyght wyth vs here in hye.' To the cyte be they gone, Gye and hys men euerychone. The knyghtys were bolde and hende: To the wallys can they wende. There \u00feey wyll \u00feemselfe defende, Tyll Jesu Cryste them helpe sende \u00b6 When \u00fee emperowre of \u00feys harde, How hys sone syr Gayer farde, To hys men can he say: 'Assembull yow thys ylke day. Wende yow forthe to \u00feat cyte: All avaunsyd schall ye bee.' \u00b6 Now \u00feey can forthe fare, To the cyte they come yare. They schette dartes and speres amonge Wyth abblasters, that were stronge. So \u00feey schett wyth harowes small And sett laddurs to the walle. Wyth ingynes \u00feey caste stones And breke the walles for \u00fee nones. They defendyd \u00fee towne wythynne: A stronge batayle they begynne. Of the Almayns there that day Many bare the dethe away. \u00b6 The emperowre had sorowe and syght, MS. syghed. That he ne may be vengyd ryght. Euery day, wythowten fayle, He made hys men \u00fee cyte to assayle, But the dewke, Gye and Harrawte Made mony a grete sawte, That ther enmyes had grete skathe. Therwyth \u00fee emperowre was wrathe. \u00b6 Hyt was on a somers day, As y the sothe telle may: When the emperowre had ete And hys grete care forgete, He clepyd hys hunte to hym there And seyde, he wolde chace \u00fee dere Erly in the morowtyde In the forest, \u00feat was so wyde, Bothe at hartys and at hyndys And wylde bestys of odur kyndys, 'Preuely that hyt be wroght, That \u00fee dewke wytt hyt noght.' \u00b6 All harde thys a spye, That was nye, wytterlye. Owte of the courte ys he gone And to \u00fee dewke went sone anone. He came rennyng all in hye To the dewke preuelye. 'Syr dewke,' he seyde, 'vndurstande; For y schall telle the tythande. The ryche emperowre Raynere Schall to morowe chace \u00fee dere In the foreste preuelye Wyth a lytull companye. Syr,' he seyde, 'y lye \u00fee noght. Be hym, \u00feat all \u00feys worlde ha\u00fee wroght, Ye may to morne there, wytterlye, Take \u00feem euerychone, sekurlye.' \u00b6 When he had hys errande sayde, The dewke on hym hys hande layde. 'Yf hyt be sothe, that thou seyste here, Thou schalt haue for thy labere An hundurd besawntys of golde To chere the wyth (for \u00feou art oolde), And to dubbe the a knyght Ryght wythynne \u00feys fowrtnyght. \u00b6 Gye and Harrawde, wyll ye here? Come to me euerychone here And Rofaran' (\u00feat was an hardy man: Ther was none wysear in Almayn, Certenly, as y yow telle, For to geue gode cowncell). 'Lordyngys, what ys yowre redde, All, \u00feat be gedurd in \u00feys stedde, Of owre lorde the emperowre, To whom we owe grete honowre? He schall in the mornynge Wende owte an huntynge But wyth a small compane: Thus hyt was tolde me. Nowe may we wythowte care Venge vs on hym thare.' \u00b6 'Syr dewke,' seyde Gye, 'y schall \u00fee saye The best cowncell, \u00feat y maye. An hundurd knyghtys y schall take, That wyll wende for thy sake, And myselfe wyth them wende To the emperowre full hende. Y wyll hym prey on feyre manere To come and dyne wyth yow here, He and all hys companye: We schall \u00feem serue rychelye. Y rede, ye dwelle here at hame: To take yowre lorde hyt were schame. Dyght thy pales nobullye: Loke, the mete be all redye. Yf he wyth loue wyll not bowe, He schall wyth awe, as y trowe. What wyth strenckyth and wyth game, Y schall \u00feem brynge all same.' \u00b6 Then seyde the dewke: 'ye sey wele. Ye schall wende, so haue y hele. An hundurd knyghtys bolde and kene Schall wende wyth yow, yf mystur bene. bene is evidently wrong, and therefore kene in the pre|ceding line is probably wrong. Qy. fre: be? Ye schall wende to that foreste And kepe hym, \u00feere ye may beste. I prey yow, let for nothynge, But that ye hys body brynge.' Gye hym armed swythe well Bothe in yron and in stele. He hyed on hys errande faste: Hys felows folowed hym at \u00fee laste.", "6": "The emperowre rose &yogh;erlye And so dud Gye, wytterlye. The emperowre and hys barons Wente to \u00fee forest of Lyons. When \u00feat \u00feey come thore, The hunters fonde a wylde boore, That was bothe wylde and kene: He slewe \u00fee howndys all bedene. The hunters faste dud hym chace: The emperowre folowed wyth hys mace. They had redyn but a whyle, Vnnethe the mowntaunce of a myle: They sye nerehande them a lyght, As hyt were of helmes bryght. All full were the feldus Bothe of hawberkys and of scheldus. 'We be take,' they seyde, 'allas, Confowndyd and slone in thys place. Tyrrye, my frende so lefe and dere, Come and see, that y see here.' He behelde on the hylle: This line appears to be corrupt. See note. 'Thou mayste \u00feem see, and \u00feou wylle: They haue vs beset on euery syde, That we may nodur go nor ryde. They wyll vs take thys ylke day Qwyck or dedde, yf they maye. They be the dewkys men Segwyne: God gyf them schame and pyne. Gye ys formeste in that dede And armed on a gode stede.' \u00b6 Then seyde Tyrrye to the emperowre: 'Wende yow hens wyth honowre; For y wyll fyght, whyll y may stande Wyth thys swyrde in my hande. Yf y may mete wyth Gye, He schall haue scathe, wytterlye. All, \u00feat come to my honde, Schall haue skathe wyth my bronde. Whyll that y be take or slone, &YOGH;yt ye schall be hens gone.' 'Nay certys,' seyde the emperowre, 'Ther schall me neuer falle \u00feat dyshonowre.' He armed hym wele, as a man, And on hys stede lepe he than. \u00b6 Wyth that come Gye prekyng there: A branche of olyfe in hys hande he bere. That was a feyre tokenynge Of pees and of looueyng. Syr Gye dud of hys hode And gret \u00fee emperowre wyth goode: 'He the saue, syr emperowre, That made \u00feys worlde, and \u00feyn honowre And thy barons, that be wyth the Gode cowncell for to geue the. The dewke yow sendyth tythynge Be me in thys morownynge And preyeth the, yf \u00fey wylle bee, To come and dwelle in hys cyte, Ye and all yowre companye: Ye schall be seruyd rychelye. He wyll the &yogh;elde castell and towre And the cyte wyth grete honowre. Yf \u00feat he haue oght mysdoone, Hyt schall be amendyd soone.' \u00b6 When \u00feat \u00fee emperowre \u00feys harde, That Gye wyth no treson farde, He clepyd the kynge of Hungarye And the erle syr Tyrrye And the erle of Wekelwolde And a knyght, syr Grumbolde. 'Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'what sey ye? Wyll we wende to that cyte?' 'Ye,' seyde Tyrrye, 'for sothenes, Hyt ys a grete mekenes, When the dewke in hys poste Wyll &yogh;ylde yow hys gode cyte And hys londe euery dele: Ye oght to loue hym wele. We schall jugge at yowre wylle. I rede yow, wende: that ys skylle. Yf hyt be sothe and no lesynge, He may do to yow no more thynge.' The emperowre seyde: 'ye sey wele. So wyll y do, so haue y hele. Yf y do that, wythowten fayle, I sewe my barons cownceyle. Y wyll wende wyth yowre redde, Whethur hyt stonde to lyfe or to dedde.' To the cyte all they went: They speke of acordement. \u00b6 Now be they come to \u00feat cyte All wyth game and wyth glee. Gye broght them to \u00fee ryche pales: I wott, he made hym wele at ese; So they dud hys meyne Wyth pyment and wyth sotelte, Wyth swannes and wyth herons, The rhyme was, no doubt, originally herouns: braouns. See the note. Wyth hertys and wyth brawnes. Gye hym payned on hys manere Hym to serue and make goode chere. Ther was none so lytull a knaue In \u00feat cowrte, \u00feat mete wolde haue, But to hym was sente plente Of \u00fee beste in \u00feat cuntre. The dewke Segwyne helde hym behynde: He drad, \u00fee emperowre wolde hym schende. He was seruyd wyth the prysons MS. prysoners. , And wyth hym were grete barons. \u00b6 The emperowre erly arose And to holy churche sone he gose, Wyth hym hys grete baronage, That were of dyuers langage. The dewke rose erly on the morowe And to \u00fee prysoners made he sorowe: 'Lordyngys, y bydde yow alle, That ye for me downe falle Before my lorde the emperowre, That ys a man of grete valowre, And prey hym, pur charyte, That he wyll forgeue me Hys yre and hys malecolye, That y neuer seruyd, wytterlye.' First y in wytterlye altered from e in MS. All they seyde wyth gode wylle: 'We schall the helpe lowde and stylle. We schall anon wyth hym wende And pray hym to be thy frende.' \u00b6 He made hym nakyd, for he was meke, Saue hys schurte and hys breke. All, that euyr dud hym see, For hym had grete pyte. To the emperowre he ys gone: A branche of olyfe hath he tane. Barefote he went \u00feorow \u00fee strete: Many a man for hym dud grete. MS. wepe. Dewkys, erles and barons Went wyth hym, \u00feat were prysons. MS. prysoners. They went to the churchewarde: God \u00feem spede and seynt Rycharde! \u00b6 When they were to churche come, The emperowre they fonde anon. 'Syr emperowre,' seyde Segwyne, 'Ye haue had for me grete pyne. Syr,' he seyde, 'y wyll be dedde Ryght in \u00feys same stedde Or be drawe wyth horsys stronge Or ellys on galows hye to honge.

He may yow helpe in yowre mystere In euery londe farre and nere. Forgeue hym, pur charyte, Or ye schall neuer haue yoye of me.' \u00b6 Than spake the dewke Raynere: 'Ye oght to loue hym dere (When he ys put in yowre mercy, To leue or dye he ys redye), When he yowre systur sone sloo Hym defendawnt, so mote y goo: Yf ther be any knyght, That wyll preue, y sey not ryght, For hym wyll y here fyght And defende hym wyth my myght. But yf ye the dewke foryeue, Y schall warre on yow, whyll y leue.' \u00b6 For\u00fee \u00feen came erle Waldynere: 'Syr emperowre, y say here, I loue the dewke ouyr all thynge. He hath hyt seruyd, wythowte lesynge. We felows ben togedur plyght. Yf ye do hym any vnryght, I schall wende to my cuntre An oost to gedur and wende wyth the.' \u00b6 The stewarde spake anon ryght: 'The dewke ys a doghty knyght. He hath done grete honowre: Whyll ye be in hys owne towre, He puttyth hym in \u00feyn owne wylle To leue or dye; and \u00feat ys skylle.

'Syr emperowre, what haue ye wroght? Ye be all to grownde broght. Ye haue forgeuyn here The dethe of yowre cosyn dere. What man schulde haue of the drede, Yf \u00feey be quytt of ther mysdede?

MS. hedde. \u00b6 There he can hys gloue wage Ryght before the baronage. They were departyd all to rathe, That ney\u00feer odur dud no skathe. The emperowre swere hys othe: Whedur of them dud odur lothe, He schulde be drawe and hangyd tyte Wythowt any more respyte.

He grauntyd anon wyth honowre That mayde, that was bryght in bowre, And he hur weddyd wyth moche game, And to hys cuntre they went same. \u00b6 The emperowre on the morne The dewke Segwyn calde hym beforne: 'Syr,' he seyde, 'stondyth here. Thou schalt haue my doghtur dere.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'god of heuyn &YOGH;ylde yow for hys nameys seuyn.' The brydale was makyd than: Feyrer sawe ther neuer man. \u00b6 Gye to Segwyne toke hys way To take hys leue wele awaye. 'Syr dewke,' seyde Gye full yare, 'I may here dwelle no mare. Y haue seruyd the in thy were: Yf any man wyll more the dere, Sende aftur me, hardylye, And y wyll come, sekerlye.' 'Syr,' seyde the dewke, 'gramercy: Hyt ys v blotted out before ys in MS. vndeserued, verylye. But ye schall dwelle here wyth me: Of my castels and my cyte, Of my goodeys the more dele Y schall the geue, so haue y hele.' He toke hys leue and went hys way: The dewke wepte, y dare well say. \u00b6 The emperowre can thens wende And wyth hym Gye blotted out before hym in MS. Gye and Harrowde hende. He bad hym castels and ryche cyteys, Grete honowrs and large feys. On ryches thoght he noght, On odur thyngys was hys thoght. \u00b6 Now ys the emperowre and Gye To Almayne gone, wytterlye. All the men of that cuntre Preysed Gye for hys bewte. He went to \u00fee wode to chace \u00fee dere And after wyth hawkys to the ryuere. On a day, as Gye dud ryde On huntynge be the see syde, He sawe a dromande to londe dryue: Faste he hyed hym thedur belyue And askyd, what that they dud \u00feere And of what cuntre \u00feat \u00feey were, Fro whens \u00feey came and what \u00feey soght And what maner marchandyse \u00feay broght. 'Hyt semeth to me be yowre chere, That ye haue grete ryches here.' Vp than starte a marynere (Of langage \u00feere was none hys pere) And seyde: 'we came hedur on \u00fee stronde Fro Constantyne, the nobull londe. We be marchandys of that cyte, That fro that cuntre chaced bee. The ryche sowdan of Sysane Sysane is probably corrupt. See note. (To honowre god wyll he not payne), xv kyngys of hethynesse MS.

Yf me thy cowncell nowe. I wyll take leue at \u00fee emperowre. Hyt wyll be moche for owre honowre: To Constantyne wyll we fare The emperowre to helpe thare. Marchandys me tolde of that lande, That he ys besegeyd strongly on euery honde. The hethyn dystroye castell and cyte, And mekyll anoyen crystyante.' 'Syr,' seyde Harrawde, 'y rede wele To wende thedur, so haue y hele.' \u00b6 They yede to the emperowre And toke \u00feer leue wyth grete honowre. He was sory of ther partynge And offerd \u00feem golde and ryche rynge. Therof had they no thoght; For, where \u00feey come, \u00feey wantyd noght. \u00b6 He toke an hundurde knyghtys wyght: To the emperowre they went ryght. They had gode wynde and passyd \u00fee see: Theder they come wyth harte free. The emperowre harde seye than, Gye was comyn to be hys man. Of hys comyng was he blythe And sende aftur hym swythe Wyth an erle of grete renowne. The emperowre seyde hys resone: 'Welcome, Gye of Warwyck, In all the worlde ys none \u00fee lyke. I haue harde the preysed be Yn many a dyuers cuntre. Y trowe, \u00feat ye schall me avayle Wyth yowre helpe and counsayle.

Y schall the serue day and nyght, As y am a trewe knyght.' Nowe he hath hys leue tane And to hys ynne ys he gone.", "7": "He ha\u00fe hym restyd but a whyle, But the mowntance of a myle. He sawe many armed men Faste in the strete renne. 'What,' he seyde, 'ys all thys fare, That y see in the strete thare? I see knyghtys armed wele Bothe in yron and in stele.' Than bespake a man wyse Of Ynglonde and Englysche: 'Hyt ys the admyrall Coldran, A cosyn of the ryche sowdan. He ys grete, hye and longe: In all \u00feys worlde ys none so stronge. Hys wepon ys smered wythall Wyth venome bytterer \u00feen \u00fee galle. Ther ys no man in &yogh;orthe, y wote, But he schulde dye, and he hym smote. He slewe my lordys sone \u00fee emperowre Thys endurs day in a stowre. Moche shame he hath vs wroght And ofte on vs warre broght. Ther ys no knyght in londe so wyght, That durste ones wyth hym fyght. Wyth hym ys the kyng of Turrye, That ledyth all that cheualrye.' \u00b6 Gye seyde to hys companye: 'Arme we vs all in hye. The sarasyns wyll we assayle: To smyte faste we wyll not fayle.' They be armed euery man: On ther horsys they lepe than. They went forthe to fyghtynge: I wot, ther was no lettynge. Gye can the admerall assayle: Hawberke nor schelde myght not avayle. The hedde fro the body he schare: To the emperowre a man hyt bare. When \u00fee emperowre hys hedde had, He was bothe yoyfull and gladde. \u00b6 Harrowde smote the kynge of Turrye, The moste schrewe of all \u00fee crye: Thorow \u00fee body he gaf hym a wounde, That dedde he felle to the grownde. Than come prekynge Gandyners, Of Almayne a knyght ferse: Smetyn he hath Rayndowne, A more traytur was neuer none. Euyn in two he clafe hys harte: That was a strock smarte. Then came forthe Mordagowre, The steward to the emperowre: Bolde he was and hardye, But a MS. And no. See note. traytowre, wytterlye. He smote there a sarazyn: Hys hedde he made hym MS. hyt. to tyne. He sturde hym full boldelye, And so dud all, that were wyth Gye. Whyll Gye had hys wepon in holde, He slewe many sarasyns bolde. So dud Harrowde, the gode knyght: He payned hym faste for to fyght. \u00b6 The sarasyns were swythe stronge And helde fyght begle and longe. Then came forthe Astadart, A sarasyn of a wyckyd parte. The burges sone of Burrye, A bolde knyght and an hardye, Syr Tebawde, he hath slayne Wyth a scharpe swyrde and wyth mayne. Then come forthe Aulart, A bolde sarasyn, wyth a darte: Syr Gylmyn he broght to grownde And gaue hym the detheys wownde. That sawe Harrawde the gode: He was sory, be my hode. Aulart he hyt wyth gode harte: The hedde fro the body starte. \u00b6 When Astadart sawe \u00feat dede, For sorowe he wolde nere wede. He smote Harrowde anon ryght And he defendyd hym, as a doghty kny&yogh;t. They two smeten togedur faste, That of \u00feer horsys downe were \u00feey caste. There \u00feey wyth ther brondys bryght Faste togedur they dud fyght. They brake scheldes and speres longe: They were knyghtys styffe and stronge. On \u00feer helmes \u00feey smete wyth soche dynte, That \u00fee fyre flewe owt, as hyt do\u00fee of flynte. Then Harrowde hym folowde faste, But to hym come helpe at the laste. Ther came an hundurde sarasyns then, That dud hym moche stronge pyne. Ther \u00feey had hym almoste slone, But syr Gye come anone. Hys swyrde harde dud he grype: The hed of of oon he can wype, Another he slowe wythowte lettynge, The thrydde also, wythowte lesynge. He hym helpyd at that nede And sett hym vpon hys stede. There he slowe and broght to grownde Many sarasyns in that stownde. On bothe partes were slayne vnryde, But moo on the sarasyns syde. Gye and hys meyne Haue slayne of them plente. \u00b6 The sarasyns flewe home ageyne. Gye them chacyd wyth my&yogh;t and mayne. Or they were of of the felde wente, Many were slayne and all toschente. &YOGH;yt was Astadart behynde, That the crysten men schende; But he flewe at the laste On a rabett swyfte and faste. Hys gode schelde was fro hym reeuyd, His helme was broke to Before to the abbreviation of and is blotted out. hys heuydde. MS. hedde. Gye hym sawe and was drerye, That he schulde passe so lyghtlye. Gye faste aftur hym dud ryde: For nothynge he wolde abyde. 'Astadart,' seyde Gye, 'turne the And oon tyme juste wyth me. Be the trowthe, \u00feat y leue on, Here ys no man, but y allone.' \u00b6 Then seyde Astadart to syr Gye: 'I the swere, wytterlye, Be thys day and be my browe And be Mahownde, \u00feat y in trowe, I schall neuer be glad nor blythe, Or y haue thy hedd swythe. Y haue behet hyt to my lemman, That ys the doghter of the sowdan.' \u00b6 He turned hym and faght faste: Ther was nother of other agaste. Astadart smote Gyone Thorowe hawberke and hakatone Ynto the body wyth a spere: Soche a dynte had he neuer ere. Wyth yre Gye smote hym in felde: Ther sauyd hym nodur hawberk nor shelde. He smote hym wyth grete envye Wyth a spere thorow the bodye. Astadart flewe awey: Gye hym folowed, per ma fay. The lyght rabet bare hym awey: Gye was sory, the sothe to say. \u00b6 Now ys Gye to hys felows went: To the cyte they be lente. In the cyte ys game and glee, That the sarasyns scowmfet bee. The emperowre sende aftur Gye And hym honowred: he was worthy. The emperowre seyde: 'be seynt Rogere, I wyll the geue my doghter dere. Thou art a man of grete valowre. Ryght wolde, \u00feou schuldest be emperowre. All, that euyr be my mayne, I wyll, that they bowe to the.' \u00b6 The steward sate at the borde And was sory of that worde. To Gye he had grete envye And thoght to do hym trecherye.", "8": "Astadart rode towarde the ooste: Moche was fallyn of hys boste. In hys body he had a tronchon: He helde hys honde on hys arson. Bothe behynde and before The blode ranne downe of hys gore. Hys helme was leyde on the syde: Hys schelde was smeten in pecys wyde. Of the dethe he had grete care And vnto the sowdan can he fare. The sowdan Astadart can see And hys woundys, \u00feat blody bee. Quod the sowdan: 'what eyleth the? Telle me, who hath woundyd the?' Quod Astadart: 'y schall yow saye Wyckyd tythyngys, be my fay. The admyrall Cordran ys dedde, And the kynge of Turrye ety\u00fe neuer bredde. An hundurd men and &yogh;yt moo Before Gye to dethe can goo.' \u00b6 Than bespake the sowdan: 'Ys thys trewe, wythowten layne? How schulde me falle \u00feys auentowre? Is ther any socowre comen to \u00fee emperowre?' 'Ye, for sothe,' quod Astadart, 'A schrewde knyght and of wyckyd harte. Ther ys none so stronge in all \u00feys lande, That schulde stonde a stroke of hys hande. In all thys worlde ys none hym lyke: Men calle hym Gye of Warwyke. Ther may no man stonde hys stroke, Thogh he were as stronge as an noke. He hath an hundurd knyghtys wyth hym, Of Almayne the beste therynne. He hath me \u00feorow the body smytte: Hyt ys my dethe, ye may wele wytt.' \u00b6 The sowdan sware be hys crowne, Be Apolyn and be Mahowne, That he schall neuyr wele be, Or he haue tane that cyte. And all herde a queynt spye And came anon vnto syr Gye And tolde hym, how \u00fee sowdan Wolde besege the cyte anon. The emperowre wyste nothynge Of the spyes smert tythynge. When he wyste hyt, he was full yare; ? sare. For to hys herte hyt dud grete care. \u00b6 The emperowre was full fayne, When the sarsyns were so slayne. He calde forthe hys fawkenere And seyde, he wolde to the ryuere Wyth hys hawkys hym to playe: Hys men went wyth hym \u00feat daye. Afturwarde a lytull whyle, When he was passyd but a myle, Then came forthe Mordagowre: Iwysse, he was a traytowre. 'Syr Gye,' he seyde, 'so haue y hele, In my herte y loue the wele.

Helpe hym neuyr god at nede, That leuyth behynde for any drede.' \u00b6 On \u00fee morne were gedurd in \u00fee feldys Twenty thousande whyte scheldys. 'Lordyngys,' sey e Gye, 'herkenyth me, All, that beleue on the trynyte. The sarsyns schall we assayle: For nothynge wyll we not fayle. Thynke on god in trynete And to holde vp crystyante And wyth strencky\u00fe of owre hondys Defende owre goodys and owre londys. They haue slayne owre frendys dere: Loke, that we be vengyd here. Yf we anythynge flee, Slayne schall we sone bee. Then schall \u00feys londe, wythowte feyne, Be in angur and yn peyne. Therfore wende we boldelye And fyght wyth them manlelye. Y wyll wyth yow thedur fare: Yf y yow fayle, god gyf me care.' All they seyde: 'gramercye! Wele haue ye spokyn now, syr Gye.' To the hylle be they gone: The sarsyns there \u00feey fownde anon. All the cuntre thereabowte Was full of sarsyns grymme and stowte. \u00b6 The sowdan calde a man wyth yre: He was ryche and a grete syre: Kynge he was wyse and bolde, The beste in all \u00feat londe tolde. 'Kynge,' seyde \u00fee sowdan, 'y commawnde \u00fee, Take twenty thousande men wyth \u00fee: Go to the hylle swythe anone And sloo the theuys euerychone. They haue me greuyd swythe sore: Loke, that y see them no more.' \u00b6 The kynge went forthe wyth hys ooste (And made moche noyse and boste) Wyth pryde for take the hylle, But y wene, that they spedde ylle. Ryght at the entre of the hylle Gye cryed lowde and schrylle: 'Lordyngys, do yowre helpe now: Hyt wyll be mekull for yowre prowe. Yf \u00feey may gete the mowntayne, We schall be takyn all or slayne. Yf we haue the hylle and \u00feey \u00fee dale, We schall \u00feem worche moche bale.' \u00b6 They caste stones and schett dartes And scharpe speres on all partes. They schett arows heded wyth stele; They faght wyth scharpe swyrdys wele. Gye, y wott, was well bolde: He gedurd them, as schyp in folde. When Gye was vppon the hylle, He made them sone to fare full ylle, That in ther downe fallynge Echoon slewe odur, wythowt lesynge; So that in a lytull stownde Tenne thousande were broght to grownde. \u00b6 When he hym sawe, \u00fee kynge of Tyre, Forthe he start wyth mekyll yre. He bare a swyrde longe and scharpe: He thoght to crysten men to carpe. He smote a knyght on the heuydde: MS. hedde. Hys lyfe \u00feere was hym bereeuydde. When Gye sawe that owtrage, He thoght to quyte hym hys wage. He smote the kynge wondur sore: He cleuyd hys crowne, he speke no more. He slewe paynyms thyckfolde, That on the hylle lay full colde. \u00b6 When the sowdan see hys men, How they in the felde ranne, Perhaps originally renne? He clepyd the kynge of Nvmbye: He was of grete felonye. 'Kyng,' he seyde, 'seyst \u00feou noght, How owre men be downe dere blotted out before downe in MS. broght? The bodyes of them on the hylle lyse. The kyng ys slayne, \u00feat was full wyse. So euyr me helpe goddys MS. god. myne, Termagawnt and Apolyne, But y be vengyd on hym sone, I schall neuyr abyde tyll none: Y schall take the hylle wyth force And sloo eche oon, be my corse. We haue an hundurd agenste oon, And therfore sone schall \u00feey be tane.' \u00b6 They toke \u00fee hylle swythe faste And many a stone downe caste. The Greges defendyd \u00feem well A&yogh;enste the sarsyns, \u00feat were trebell. They smote of wyth \u00feer gysarmes MS. gesernes. Fete and honde, schouldur and armes. That ylke batell was full stronge: There dyed many a man amonge. \u00b6 So wele dud Gye that day, That he was preysed for nobull ay. In a stedde stylle he stode And faght wyth an harte gode. The paynyms faste hym assayle: He them hyt, wythowten fayle, Bothe before and behynde. He smote downe, \u00feat he myght fynde, That wythynne a lytull stownde There lay abowte hym on \u00fee grownde An hundurd slayne and wele moo, That hym had &yogh;ernyd for to sloo. To hys breste laye the hepe, That he myght not awey lepe. Also dud Harrowde sore: He faght, as a wylde bore. He had a swyrde, that was gode: Many a hedde wyth that of yode. Of the sarsyns he smote \u00feat day Two hundurd, or he went away. Hys hawberke was brokyn wyde Wyth many hoolys on euery syde. Paynyms assaylyd hym at \u00feat case, That hys hawberke brokyn was. He defendyd hym, as a lyowne, And all, \u00feat was wyth MS. wyth hym Gyowne. Gyowne; And also dud the Gregeyse Defende them wele in all wyse. \u00b6 The kyng of Charturs was tane And other sarsyns many ane. Gye \u00feere made a grete wondur; For some of \u00feem he smote in sondur. Gye and hys ferys were armed wele Bothe in yron and in stele. In \u00feat brunte many they hente And many slewe and all torente. They were so smert and so kene: They made the sarsyns all to flene On euery syde therwythall. They of \u00fee hylle downe let falle Many and \u00feyck of grete stones, That were ordeygned for \u00fee nones, As grett, as any man may bere, The sarsyns wyth for to dere. They let the stones downe glyde And slewe many on euery syde. Tenne thousande in a stownde There were slayne and bro&yogh;t to grownde. Hyt felle so that ylke day, That fewe of \u00feem went away. \u00b6 The nyght ys comen, \u00fee day ys gone: The sarsyns bene all slone. So many sarsyns \u00feere were slone, That ix furlonge men myght gone, &YOGH;yt schulde \u00feey set no fote on grownde For dedde bodyes in \u00feat stownde. \u00b6 Forthe went in yre Abelle the wyght: He was newe dubbed knyght. To the sowdan he come thore: He was woundyd passynge sore. 'Sowdan,' he seyde, 'flee or be dedde: Seyst thou not thy men redde? Thy goddys \u00fee had not in \u00feer thoght, Therfore haue we spedde noght. We wyll \u00feem brenne in fyre bryght: They dud vs neuer gode in fyght. Wende now on yowre stede browne Whome vnto yowre pavelowne. Brynge home \u00fee men, \u00feat woundyd are: &YOGH;yt some of \u00feem may wele fare.' \u00b6 Now be the sarsyns come ageyne Wyth grett schame and many slayne. The sowdan dud before hym brynge All hys goddys in a thrynge. 'A, goddys,' he seyde, 'ye are false: The deuyll yow honge be the hals. I haue done yow many a gode dede: Euyll ye haue qwytt me my mede. Ye wolde me serue, yf ye myght stonde, As ye haue done before honde.' He toke a staffe of appulle tre And bete hys goddys all thre. He brake of \u00feem bo\u00fee legge and arme: 'Ye dud me neuer gode, but harme. Gode may ye do me none More, than the harde stone.' He toke \u00feem be the fete faste And dud \u00feem sone owte caste. \u00b6 Sythen he lepe on hys rabyte MS. rabett. And sende a messengere full tyte To all men in hys poste Fro thens vnto the redde see And bad \u00feem come for \u00feer honowre Hym to helpe and to socowre. \u00b6 Gye clepyd to hym hys mayne: 'Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'god thanked be. We haue done a feyre chace: Lorde be thankyd of hys grace. Owre enmyes be all tane, Ouyrcomen and many slane. To the cyte wyll we gone Wyth owre felows euerychone.' All wyth yoye \u00feey went home, But \u00feey were woundyd euerychone. \u00b6 Now ys Gye of grete poste: All hym loueyd in that cyte. The emperowre, so haue y hele, Loueyd Gye swythe wele. Thorowe hys helpe he wende full well To wynne hys londe euery dele. Gye doyth all, that euyr he wyll, In the courte bothe lowde and stylle. \u00b6 Then spake syr Morgadowre, That ylke false traytowre. He began to thynk a wyle, How he myght Gye begyle. He hath thoght a felonye (Soche oon harde y neuer, wytterlye) For to make Gye to do message To the sowdan, that ys so rage. He thoght, yf Gye thedur wente, He schulde neuer aftur more be sente. Gone he ys the emperowre nere And seyde to hym on thys manere: 'Yf ye wyll leue my cownceyle, MS. cowncell. Hyt schall \u00fee well gretly avayle In all thynge, that y may do; For y am moost holdyn thertoo. But y telle yow gode redde, I wyll, ye do me vnto dedde. The sowdan hath sende hys messengere Thorow all hys londe ferre and nere, To hym schulde come more and lesse All men, that in hys lande ys, That may bere schylde or spere Or hys owne hedde bere, Yow to sege in yowre cyte And yow to take and yowre meyne. \u00b6 Now haue ye here a knyght: In all \u00fee worlde ys none so wyght. That ys Gye of moche pryse And wyth hym Harrowde \u00fee MS. of. marchyse. In hym ye may yow wele affye; He wyll yow helpe, sekurlye. Sende a knyght \u00fee sowdan to say And byd MS. bad. hym sygne a certeyn day. Whyll he wyll algate haue \u00fey lande And all wyth strenckyth of mannys hande, Byd hym sende a gode knyght Wyth oon of yowres for to fyght. Yf hyt may so betyde, That yowrys haue \u00fee bettur syde, He let yow haue all yowre lande Wyth pees in yowre owne hande. And, yf hys knyght haue \u00fee maystry And ouyrcome yowres wyth felonye, For yowre lande ye schall do homage And euery yere &yogh;elde hym trewage.' \u00b6 Than spake \u00fee emperowre Ernys: MS. in Ernys. 'Syr steward, at thyn avyce I schall wytt at my baronage, Who wyll do thys message; And, yf any wyll thedur fare, He schall be preysyd for euermare. He, \u00feat wendyth abowte that thynge, Drede hyt ys of hys home comynge.' \u00b6 He let calle hys baronage And all men, \u00feat he gaue wage. 'Lordyngys,' seyde the emperowre, 'I say for yowre honowre, All, that euyr be gedurd here, Erle, baron, knyght and squyere: I wyll sende a messengere To the sowdan on all manere. I wolde not warre, yf y myght, But holde my londe wyth lawe and ryght. Let hym fynde a sarsyn And y to fynde a knyght of myn. The batell vpon them schall goo: Let hyt be done betwyx \u00feem twoo.

Yf he falle on \u00fee warse syde, As god graunte, hyt so betyde, He schall fro my londe ryde And make here no lenger abyde Nor no nodur of hys lynage Do me no wronge nor no owtrage. And, who dar do my &yogh;ernynge And fro me bere thys tythynge, I schall hym loue ouer all odur And holde hym, as myn own brodur.' \u00b6 When \u00fee emperowre had all sayde And all hys speche downe layde, Ther was none of all, \u00feat \u00feere were blotted out before \u00feere in MS. ware, That wolde speke, lesse nor mare. Then vp starte a nobull knyght: The constabull Crystofor he hyght. To hys gyrdull hys berde was longe: Whyll he was yonge, he was stronge. 'Syr emperowre, be thys day, As me thynkyth, y schall say. I oght to geue yow gode cownceyle MS. cowncell. And to do yow honowre, wythowte fayle. To sende yowre men for to be dedde, Me thynkyth, hyt ys a sympull redde. Thou myghtyst as wele wyth \u00feyn hande Slee \u00fey men wele wyttande. I wene, ye schall fynde none in \u00feys lande, That wyll on that errande fonde. For cowardyse sey y hyt noght; For wyth my wylle and my thoght, Yf y now also nobull were here, As y was wythynne thys ix yere, I wolde do that ylke sonde: For \u00fee dethe schulde y not wonde.

Now am y olde and may not vayle, But yf hyt be to geue cownseyle.' \u00b6 Harrawde lokyd on syr Gye And thoght, what he wolde sey, veryly. He wolde haue askyd \u00feat vyage, Yf Gye had not take \u00feat owtrage. When Gye harde the worde to ende, That no man profurde hym to wende (He stode stylle, as a stone, To wytt the wylle of euery mone, Yf any were so bolde and wyght, That durste do \u00feat errande ryght): Gye vp starte swythe wyght. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y am yowre knyght: Y schall to the sowdan fare And telle hym yowre errande thore. To do yowre errande y schall fonde: For the dethe y wyll not wonde. There schall be none so lytull a page, But he schall here my message' . . . . . After this some lines are wanting. See note. \u00b6 Gye &yogh;yt answeryd wyth grete yre: 'I schall not leeue, be my swyre, w in swyre in part illegible because of a spot. But y wyll wende in thys case To dye therfore in the place.' \u00b6 Now wendyth Gye owt of \u00fee prees Vnto the oost of the Gregeyes. Gye ys a bolde baron: God, that suffurde hys pascioun, Yeue hym grace wele to fare And to come ageyne wythowten care! He came to hys herbergye And fonde hys felowes heuelye. They wolde wende wyth hym echone, But he wolde suffer of \u00feem neuer oon. Quod Harrowde: 'let me wyth the fare: To dye wyth the y am full yare.' 'Harrowde,' seyde Gye, 'be here stylle: Thou schalt not wende wyth my wylle.' \u00b6 Gye hym armed on all wyse Wele and on a queynte gyse. On he caste an hawberke bryght: Whyll he had \u00feat, he dradde no wyght. On hys hedde hys helme he caste And lasyd hym swythe faste: A serkyll of golde, \u00feat wolde noght Perhaps corrupt. See note. Wyth an c pownde of golde be boght. Hyt was full of precyous stones And ryche perles for the nones. Sythen he gurde hym wyth hys bronde: Hyt was worthe moche londe. Hys schylde he caste abowte hys halse And a spere he toke alse. Hys gode stede he bestrode: Forthe of the cyte sone he rode. Al men of that grete cyte Of syr Gye had grete pyte. All \u00feey wepyd swythe sore: They wenyd to see hym no more.", "10": "Now hath Gye, as y say, Toward the sowdan take \u00fee way. He ne stynte nor he ne blanne, Or he to the sowdan came. As he rode vp and downe, He knewe \u00fee sowdans pavelowne. An egull of golde \u00feeron was bryght And a stone, that gaue grete lyght, That men myght see all the nyght, As hyt had be the sonne MS. somer bryght. \u00b6 When he came to the pavelowne, In he wente, be my crowne. He fonde the sowdan at hys mete And wyth hym xv kyngys grete And odur men of grete valowre, And all \u00feey seruyd the sowdan \u00feore. Forthe than starte syr Gyowne And schewyd sone hys resowne: 'That ylke kynge, \u00feat sytty\u00fe in heuyn, That made \u00fee erthe and \u00fee planettys seuyn And in the see the sturgone, Yeue the, syr sowdan, hys malysone And all, that y hereynne see, That beleue in Mahowndys poste. \u00b6 Thys worde sendyth \u00fee the emperowre, That ys a man of grete valowre, Thorow whom the sarsyns were tane, Many woundyd and many slane. He bad, \u00feou schuldest not dwelle longe In hys londe to do hym wronge. Yf ye chalenge oght wyth ryght, He byddyth the sende forthe a knyght, That wyll sone for the fyght; And, yf owres be slayne wyth force and my&yogh;t, He wyll the geue trewage be yere And serue the, as hys lorde dere; And, yf hys knyght thorow grace Ouercome yowrys in the place, Thou schalt delyuyr hys londe rathe And restore hym ageyne hys skathe. Wyth the emperowre, y the say, Of thys thynge thou take a day. And, yf that \u00feou wylte not thys, Telle me, what thy talente ys. Here y am for my lordys sake: Yf ony wyll the batell take, I wyll defende my lordys londe, ho blotted out before londe in MS.

Ther was neuer k blotted out before neuer in MS. knyght nor squyere, That durste speke so to me ere.' Gye seyde: 'y schall the saye My name, or y wende awaye. I wyll \u00fee nor no nodur beswyke. Y am Gye of Warwyke.' \u00b6 'Art thou,' he seyde, '\u00feat ylke page, That hast done me all \u00fee owtrage? Thou slewe my cosyn Coldrane: Hys hedde thou smote of allone.

When he had etyn and made hym at ese, He thoght Gye for to sese. Abowte Gye was grete thronge. 'God wott,' quod he, 'y stonde to longe.' There he faryd, as he wolde wede: Wyth hys spurrys he stroke hys stede. 'Sowdan,' he seyde, '\u00feou schalt abye Furste of all thys companye.' He smote the sowdan wyth hys sworde, That the hedde trendyld on \u00fee borde. The hedde he toke in hys honde: Owte of \u00fee pales dud he wonde. He smote of many a hevydde MS. hedde.

The sarsyns hyed \u00feem full faste Aftur Gye, when he was paste. Gye to take they were preste: Many a man dud hys beste. Gye rode to a roche of stone: The paynyms folowde hym euerychone. Ofte he turned them ageyne: Many of them hath he slayne. Ther was neuer &yogh;yt man on grounde, That durste agenste so many stonde.", "11": "Now of Harrowde wyll we speke: For sorowe, he \u00feo&yogh;t, hys herte dud breke. He ha\u00fee so moche sorowe and woo, That he may not oon fote goo. For Gye all \u00feat sorowe hath he: He wende, he schulde hym neuer see. 'Alas, Gye,' syr Harrowde seyde, 'That \u00feou were so fowle betrayed. Now wott y wele, wythowten drede, I schall hym neuer see on stede. Then were y schente: what shall y doo? I haue no man to moone me too.' \u00b6 As he was in sorowe and dud wepe, Vppon hys bedd he felle on slepe. He can mete a straunge swevon: He thoght, he sawe syr Gyowne On a stede faste syttande And a scharpe spere in hys hande. Lyons and lebardes assayled hym faste, That had made hym sore agaste. Hys schylde was brokyn euyn in two, And hys hawberke was reuyn also. Wyth moche pyne he helde hys lyfe: He was in so moche stryfe. \u00b6 When Harrowde of hys slepe dud wake, For drede faste can he quake. On hys felows dud he calle: 'Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'arme yow all. To helpe Gye, loke, no man fayle; For he ys in moche batayle.' Hastyly were they dyght On ther horsys redy to fyght. Faste they redyn forthe in hye For drede of ther maystyr Gye, That he schulde be woundyd or slane MS. slayne. Or ellys wyth \u00feem to preson tane. \u00b6 At the laste they sawe the ooste Of the sarsyns, that made boste. Of armed men were full \u00fee feldes, Some wyth hawberkys and some wyth scheldes. All they chasyd there syr Gye; Hym to sloo they were redye. They hym assayled on euery syde, And he gaue \u00feem strokys vnryde. So nerehonde \u00fee paynyms yede, They had \u00fee brydull of hys stede. Then was Gye in sorowe and woo, That he myght not passe \u00feem froo. All tho, that wolde hym take, He made \u00fee rugges for to crake. \u00b6 Then came syr Harrawde: To a paynym he made asawte. He hyt hym hye vppon \u00fee crowne: There halpe hym not syr Mahowne. To \u00fee breste \u00fee swyrde went ynne: Therof thoght he no synne. Echeoon of the companye Slewe two paynyms or thre. Than \u00feere was a batell stronge, And many sarsyns dyed amonge. \u00b6 Now hath Harrowde yoye and game, That he and Gye were mett same. For yoye, that they were mette, Wyth ther eyen bothe \u00feey grette. MS. wepte. Then kyssyd Gye euery man, When he was fro thronge tane. The sarsyns be ageyne wente All wyth sorowe and beschente. Gye wyth yoye and hys meyne Turned ageyne to the cyte All wyth pryde and yolytee, Wyth moche game and more glee. Then beganne \u00fee bellus to rynge, Prestys and clerkys meryly to synge. When \u00feey sawe \u00fee hed than, Moche yoye made many a man. All they seyde: 'wythowte lese, Of the sowdan schall we h blotted out before we in MS. haue pese. Thankyd be god all weldynge, That he vs hath sende that tythynge.' \u00b6 Gye ys gone vnto the towre And presentyd the hedde to the emperowre. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'vndurstande: The hedde, that y bere in in altered from on in MS. hande, Ys the hedde of the grete sowdan: I hym slewe myselfe allone. Y yow make thys present: Take hyt wyth gode entent.' When \u00fee emperowre sawe \u00feat thynge, He my&yogh;t hym not holde fro wepeynge. An hundurd sythe he hym kyste: What yoye he made, no man wyste. All they thankyd heuyn kynge, That \u00fee warre was broght to endynge. \u00b6 Gye made or the thrydde day A pyller of marbull grett and graye: Aboue he set a hedde of brasse, In that the sowdans hed was. Aboue all he sett a crowne; Ryght in mydwarde of the towne, That all odur warned myght bee, That wolde do harme to the cyte. \u00b6 Than spake the emperowre Ernys: MS. in ernys. 'Gye, herkyn to myn avyse. I thynke to do the gret honowre: Take \u00feou my doghtur in hur bowre.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'gramercy: That ys vndeserued, sekerlye.' \u00b6 The emperowre comawndyd hys men To make \u00feem redy be ix and tenne, 'And thorowowt my londe fare And store ageyne, \u00feat lorne was are.' \u00b6 The emperowre rose erlye: Matens and messe he harde in hye And sythen he lepe on a mewle browne And toke wyth hym syr Gyowne, Dewkys and erlys, that there were, That had hym serued far and nere: To hunte they went that day. The wedur was hote in \u00fee waye. Gye sawe, as he dud ryde, As he blenchyd hym besyde, A lyon come towarde hym werelye, But vnnethe he myght drye. He brayed faste and gaped wyde: He wyste not, where he my&yogh;t hym hyde. Aftur hym come a dragon, That folowde faste the lyon. Hys hed was gret and grennyng And hys eyen, as fyre, brennyng. Hys tethe scharpe, hys mow\u00fee wyde: Hys body was grett and vnryde. He was grymme and he was felle: He went, hyt had be \u00fee deuyll of helle. \u00b6 Then seyde Gye to hys meyne: 'I wyll go forthe sekerlye. Y wyll preue wyth all my myght, Whedur y dare wyth \u00fee &yogh;ondur dragon fy&yogh;t. Loke, ye store not of \u00feat stedde, Whedur y be quyck or dedde.' \u00b6 Gye a spere toke in hys honde: Fro hys felows he hym wonde. He went forthe a gode spede To helpe the lyon at that nede. When \u00fee dragon sawe Gyowne, He came to hym and lefte \u00fee lyone. Gye sawe hym come fleande: He toke hys spere in hys hande. He lokyd, where he my&yogh;t do hym skathe, And he aspyed hyt sone full rathe. Vndur the wynge he schett \u00fee spere: Thorow \u00fee body he dud hym bere. Then the dragon felle to grownde And dyed in a lytull stownde. He drewe hys swerde made of stele And smote of hys hedde euery dele. He behelde the body on grownde: Hyt stanke, as a pyllyd hownde. \u00b6 Gye rode to hys men warde: The lyon folowed hym full harde. He went before Gye pleying And wyth hys tayle hym faynynge.

The lyon walowed on the grownde Before Gye, as dothe an hownde. Sythen he playde wyth hym faste: Of hym Gye was not agaste. Gye lepe on hys stede than: The lyon before hym faste ranne. He folowed Gye est and weste: Gye hym louydde at the beste. Gye to the emperowre dud ryde: The lyon yede be hys syde. Gye hym tolde euery dele, How that he had spedd wele. All \u00feey wondurde on the lyon, That he louyd so syr Gyone. \u00b6 The emperowre and hys meyne Went vnto the cyte. Bothe Gye and the emperowre Togedur \u00feey went to the towre. Gye into hys chaumbur ys gone And wyth hym went hys gode lyone. Into what stede \u00feat Gye wente, The lyon folowed hym, verament. Before Gyes bedde he laye: Ther my&yogh;t no man brynge hym awaye. Of hym was Gye full fayne, For he was hys chaumburleyne. \u00b6 When \u00feey had the londe rede thorowe, Castels, cytes, towne and borowe, To Constantyne \u00feey came in hye. The emperowre callyd to hym syr Gye 'Gye,' he seyde, 'grathe the therforne: My doghtur \u00feou schalt wedde to morne. Tyme ys comen, and y am payde: Hyt schall no lenger be delayde.'

All men, \u00feat \u00feere dud stande, Were fayne of that tythande. Gye hym thankyd answeryd originally in MS., but the scribe has blotted it out, adding thankyd in the margin. nobullye Of hys honowre and hys curtesye. \u00b6 Then came the byschoppe revyscht And broght ryngys of the beste.

Wythowte ony more he felle to grownde: Soche an euyll toke hym in \u00feat stownde. \u00b6 'Syr emperowre,' seyde Gye, 'For the loue of owre lady, Do thys spowsage in respyte (Ye may me nothynge wyte), Tyll that y amendyd bee Of stronge peyne, \u00feat greuy\u00fe me.' 'Me forthynkyth,' quod \u00fee emperowre, 'sore, That hyt schulde be delayed more.' The emperowre made euyll chere And all, \u00feat euer abowte hym were. \u00b6 Now be they partyd aweye Wyth moche sorowe, be thys daye.

The lyon went thorow \u00fee pales And of hym spake all the Gregyes And of the boldenes of Gyowne, How he slewe the dragon. The steward had grete envye: He \u00feoght, \u00fee lyon schulde abye. \u00b6 Aftur mete a longe owre Gye went wyth the emperowre: The lyon went in that palees Meryly and in feyre pese.

Hys fete he lykkyd wyth mornynge: Hyt was a tokyn of loueynge. \u00b6 When Gye hym sawe woundyd \u00feore, For hys lyon he wepyd sore. 'God,' he seyde, 'of mekyll myght, Who hath do me \u00feys vnryght? Now he hath my lyon slane, All my yoye ys fro me tane. Be god, that dyed on a tre, I wolde not for thys feyre cyte, What some euyr that he bee, That hath thus betrayed me.' \u00b6 Wyth that he sawe before hys eye Hys lyon gode there dye.

To seke \u00fee steward he was besye. Into a chaumbur can he gone: He fonde the steward \u00feere anon. He pleyde at chesses wyth hys cosyn, When he sye Gye loke so grymme.

Defende \u00fee now, as a knyght: I wyll \u00fee smyte wyth all my myght.' He drewe hys swyrde: or he stynte, Hys hedde he smote of at a dynte. \u00b6 When hys cosyn sye that dede, For wo, he \u00feoght, hys herte wolde blede He starte on a nodur parte And in hys honde he hent a darte. Gye hym kept and dud hym harme: He smote of hys ryght arme. Tho he cryed: 'Gye, gramercye,' And he went fro hym in hye. \u00b6 Comen he ys to the emperowre: 'Syr,' he seyde, 'for yowre honowre I haue the seruyd wyth my powere: Hyt ys me quytt on euyll manere, Whyll y haue lorne be treson In yowre court my gode lyon. Yowre steward slewe hym in grete yre: I haue quyt hym wele hys hyre. For euer he hath hys waryson: Schall he neuer more do treson.

Let be youre frendys in your cuntre: To morowe schall yow weddyd bee.' \u00b6 Gye seyde: 'syr, y thynke, noght. Wyfe to take ys not my thoght. Yf y had weddyd \u00fey doghtur dere And ye had made me lorde here, Yowre men wolde among \u00feem saye And oftesythe make deraye, That ye had made the emperowre But of a pore bachelowre, And that hyt were a grete dysperage To the and all thy baronage.

Fyfte somers and fyfte stedys He badde Gye to hys medeys, But he had wonne before ynowe Of \u00fee sarsyns, that he had slowe. \u00b6 The emperowre dud, as a lorde hende, To Gyes men, when \u00feey schulde wende: He gaue them golde for Gyes sake As moche, as they wolde take. All they seyde, the emperowre Was a man of grete valowre. \u00b6 Knyghtys and squyers, \u00feat \u00feere ware, All dud wepe, when Gye dud fare. Wyueys, maydenys and chylder also All \u00feey weped, when he schulde goo: Whyll he was in that lande, Ther wolde no man brynge warre on honde. \u00b6 The emperowre syr Harrowde calde And askyd hym, yf he dwelle wolde Wyth hym in that cyte, And a ryche man schulde he bee: He schulde hym geue, sekurlye, Of all \u00feat lande \u00fee feyrest lady. 'Syr,' seyde Harrowde, 'gramercy.

The emperowre honowred Gye And all hys feyre companye. When Gye a stownde had dwellyd \u00feare, To hys cuntre wolde he fare. They hyed on ther way faste: They come to Loren at the laste. They were resseyuyd nobullye For ther grete cheualrye. \u00b6 Hyt was in may on a daye, When euery fowle makyth hys laye: Thorow a foreste as \u00feey dud ryde (A feyre cyte was besyde), Wyth grete loue Gye badde hys men Wende vnto the cyte then To take \u00feer innes, \u00feere \u00feey dud knowe; For \u00feere he wolde be a throwe To here fowles merely synge And see feyre flowres MS. fowles. sprynge. \u00b6 Hys men haue the wey tane: In the forest Gye ys allane.

Hys berde was longe, as a spanne: Hys vysage was bo\u00fee pale and wanne For the blode, that he had bledde, And for \u00fee woundys, that he hedde. MS. hadde. Hys eyen were black, hys vysage brade, Longe forhede and wele made. Feyre and longe was he thore: A godelyar man was none bore. In a robe of scarlet was he cladde.

Ryse vp and come wyth me: To Tyrrye y wyll lede the.' On a mewle he sett \u00feat maye And to \u00fee wode he toke \u00fee way. When he came to \u00fee hawethorn tree, Awey was syr Tyrre. Therfore he made grete deraye, For he was so gone away. Sory was tho syr Gye; For he wende full sekurlye, That wylde bestys of \u00feat foreste Wyth hym had made ther feste. \u00b6 He lokyd hym a lytull besyde And he sye fete of horsys vnryde. He set \u00fee mayde on \u00fee grownde And rode hymselfe for\u00fee in \u00feat stownde. He folowed the trace swythe faste And he sye knyghtys at the laste. Syr Tyrrye wyth \u00feem \u00feey dud lede And he hyed hym aftur a gode spede. Full sone \u00feen came he \u00feem nere: He bad \u00feem on feyre manere To delyuer to hym \u00feat woundyd knyght. 'I haue to hym my trowthe plyght (Y wylle hyt holde, yf \u00feat y myght. Ye do hym, me \u00feynky\u00fe, no ryght), That y schulde, when he wore dedde, Bery hym in some gode stedde; And y bydde yow now pur charyte, That body ye delyuyr to mee.' \u00b6 There turned ageyne a Lumbarde, That was Otons stewarde. In a bote he passed owre MS. ouyr. After this line In a bote and odur fowre struck out. Aftur Tyrrye and odur fowre. To Gye he seyde: 'what art thou?

Than cam syr Hewchowne, That was cosyn to dewke Oton: He can Gye faste assayle, That \u00fee steroppe he made hym to fayle. So nye Gye dud he goo, That Gye smote hys body in twoo. The fowrthe fledde at the laste: I trowe, he were somewhat agaste. Gye toke vp syr Tyrrye And set hym on hys hors hym bye. Gye hym to \u00feat thorne broght, But \u00feat maye fonde \u00feey noght. \u00b6 Now wyll we leue of syr Gye And of the maydyn speke in hye, On what maner sche was gane And owt of the foreste tane.

Tyrrye seruyd dewke Loyere, And hym louyd and helde hym dere And dud hym grete honowre: He was a man of grete valowre. The dewke had a doghtur in bowre: Whyte sche was, as lylly flowre.

'Syr,' \u00feey seyde, 'we be redye A&yogh;enste \u00feem for to fyght in hye.'

A nother \u00feere he woundyd depe: Schylde nor hawberk myght hym not kepe. Wyth strenkyth he smote hym thore, That on hys fete he yede no more. \u00b6 When Tyrrye sye hys men fyght, He slewe many a doghty knyght. There lay in the felde slone In a whyle many oon. Boldelye faght syr Tyrrye And all hys feyre companye. Tyrrye smote the constabull Of hys stede, wythowte fabulle.

Tyrrye defendyd hym, as a lyon: Many an hedde he smote of, be my crowne; For lothe he was for to flee: He had wele leuyr slayne bee. \u00b6 Then seyde Harrowde to Gye: 'Se ye not syr Tyrrye?

Then hyed he forthe a gode spede To helpe Tyrrye in hys nede. \u00b6 Now comyth Gye to that batayle: The Lorens sone dud hym assayle. Sone Gye smote Gayere, The dewkys cosyn Loyere. He smote hym downe wyth hys spere And he hym toke, as falleth to were. Gye to a nodur rode: Hys spere \u00feorow the body glode. He smote a nodur, so dud he moo: Many he made to dethe goo.

Who so had sene Gye And wyth hym Harrowde and Tyrrye, There they dud that ylke day, That hyt ys wondur for to say. Of Lorens grete plente Dyed that day ryght in hye. \u00b6 Gye the constabull hyt thare, That of hys hors he hym bare. He toke hym than in \u00feat batayle.

Wythynne the oost a bowe draght Gye wyth hys swyrde hym raght. He thoght for to smyte sore And for to be avengyd thore: Betwene the body and the arson Felle hys dynte there adowne. The sadull of golde and \u00feat stede He smote a too in that nede. There they prekyd abowte syr Gye, But he defendyd hym manlye. Gye prekyd thorow the ooste: They hym folowed wyth grete boste. He mette Harrowde and Tyrrye: Of hym they had ferlye, On what maner he passyd away. They thankyd god \u00feat same day, That \u00feey had so mette the Lumbardes, They schulde not sey, \u00feey were cowardes. They gaue them strokys vnryde And woundyde them on euery syde. \u00b6 Then seyde Gye to hys felows tho: 'Hyt ys tyme, that we goo.' To the cyte can they fare And carefull lefte \u00fee Lumbardes \u00feare. Gye and Tyrrye be hole and sownde, Harrowde hath an euyll wounde. Forthe they wente all thre Wyth yoye vnto the cyte. All the men of that cuntre Looueyd god in trynyte, That syr Harrowde had hys lyfe; For he had be in so moche stryfe. Gye made to come to hys honde The beste lechys of that londe. Harrowdes wounde \u00feey helyd wele In a whyle, so haue y hele. They were then full blythe And thankyd god fele sythe, That \u00feey had ouercomen \u00feer enemyes Thorow goddys helpe and syr Gyes. Now \u00feey drad \u00feem no mare, For they were broght owt of care. \u00b6 The dewke Oton ys comen hame: Of hys dede he had grete schame. Lechys he had there gode: They helyd hym sone, be my hode. When hys woundys were whayle, He wente to the dewke, sawns fayle, And tolde hym of hys wykkyd care, How he had be in sorowe sare. \u00b6 To dewke Loyer seyde Oton: 'Herkyn to my reson. But ye haue \u00fee better cownsayle, MS. cownsell. Ye lose yowre londe, wythowte fayle, Thorowe \u00fee men Harrowde and Gye And wyth them \u00fee erle Tyrrye.

I wolde not Tyrrye so begyle Nor qwyte hym not so hys wylle For hys gode dede and hys serues Nodur Gye nor Harrowde \u00fee marches. Yf syr Tyrrye haue done any skathe, Sone he may amende hyt rathe.

Or hyt were dayes thre, Comyn he was to that cyte. There he fonde the erle Awbrye And he hym kyssed curteslye. 'He grett yow wele, \u00fee dewke Loyere, And byddyth yow on feyre manere Come to hys cyte, verament: And, yf ye wyll to hym assent, He wyll geue thy sone Tyrrye Hys doghtur to wyfe, sekurlye, And in that same feyre cyte Schall the brydale holdyn bee.

The erle Tyrrye ys full fayne. When the tyme was nye tolde, All the knyghtys yonge and olde Dyghtyd them, as men hende, And to the parlement dud \u00feey wende: The erle Awbrye and Tyrrye, Harrowde and gode syr Gye; Wyth \u00feem v hundurde knyghtys wyght, Echon on MS. of. stedeys feyre and lyght. They were all clothed well In scarlet and in ryche sendell. They had wyth \u00feem \u00fee maydyn &yogh;ynge.

Thus the dewke Oton can say: 'For goddys loue, graunte vs \u00feat to daye.' \u00b6 Than seyde dewke Loyere: 'As ye haue seyde, y graunt hyt here. I forgeue hym myn euyll wylle: I schall hym loue lowde and stylle.' \u00b6 Then spake dewke Oton: 'I prey yow all, beseche Gyowne, Yf y haue oght ageyne hym done, That y muste amende hyt sone.

Euery man a pece hente: All the robe was torente. Gye wyth strenkyth dud vp lepe And fellyd mony on a hepe. Hys stede sone he bestrode And lepe on hym, as he were wode. He smote the stede in the syde: Forthe of the place dud he ryde. \u00b6 When he hym sye, the dewke Oton, That syr Gye was so gone, Lowde he cryed to hys meyne: 'Lepe on yowre stedys: what do ye?

There was Gye a whyle stylle And had ynogh of hys wylle; Tyll he wente vpon a day Wyth howndys hym for to play, And also the dewke Loyere Wente for to chace the dere: Wyth hym he toke \u00fee erle Tyrrye And many a nodur knyght ky blotted out before knyght in MS. hardy. \u00b6 They enturde into a wylde foreste And \u00feere \u00feey fonde a bore wylde and preste. All \u00fee howndys, they had, than Aftur the bore faste they ranne. The bore awey faste ys gone And many of \u00fee howndys he ha\u00fe slone: Moo, \u00feen twenty, in a stownde Had he broght vnto the grownde. He passyd the foreste hastelye: They folowed hym wyth grete crye. Faste he passyd thorow \u00fee londe: Ther durste no hownde come nerehonde. The knyghtys prekyd aftur faste, Tyll \u00feer horsys myght not laste. The howndys, that folowed \u00feat day, Were slayne all be the way: Thes odur were werye, They went home, \u00feey Another went blotted out after \u00feey in MS. my&yogh;t not drye, All, but thre, that were wyght, That folowed alwey wyth ther myght, Tyll they come to Bretayne. Ther folowed \u00feem nodur kny&yogh;t nor swayne: Of them all was no huntere, That wyste, where the borre were, But syr Gye hymselfe allone, That folowed faste wyth grete randone On hys stede faste prekynge And wyth hys horne faste blowynge. \u00b6 Gye chasyd the borre so faste, He came to Bretayne at the laste. Be then was \u00fee boore full hote: He fonde a dyke and yn he smote. There he wandyrde faste abowte And wrotyd faste wyth hys snowte. Gye sawe the bore well And, what he dud, euery delle. d erased before delle in MS. Downe he lyght of MS. on. hys stede And to the bore soon he yede. He toke hys swyrde in hys hande: The boore hym sye and came rennande. Gye on \u00fee rygge smote hym soo, That hys body felle in twoo. The boore felle downe at \u00fee laste, And Gye wyth hys horne blewe a blaste. He wende to haue had some felowe, But ther was none, \u00feat dud hym knowe. He was in a farre cuntre All aloone fro hys meyne, And, as he openyd there the boore, Euyr he blewe more and more. \u00b6 Then bespake erle Florentyne: 'What may thys be, for seynt Martyne, That y here blowe in my foreste? Takyn they haue some wylde beste.' Forthe he clepyd there a knyght, Hys owne sone, that was wyght. 'My dere sone,' he seyde, 'hye the, That he were broght anon to me. Whedur he be knyght or huntere, Brynge hym hedur on all manere.' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'hyt schall be done.' He lepe on a stede sone. To the foreste he came in hye And sone he mett wyth syr Gye. He bare a staffe and that a longe: Therwyth he \u00feoght to do Gye wronge. 'Harlot,' he seyde, 'what art thou, That comen art into \u00feys foreste nowe Wythowte \u00fee leue of my fader? MS. ffadur. In wyckyd tyme come thou here. How durste \u00feou take thys wylde beste Wythowte leue in thys foreste? Geue me thy horne: be thy swyre, I schall \u00fee brynge vnto my syre.' \u00b6 'Syr,' seyde Gye, 'wyth gode chere, Yf ye hyt aske in feyre manere.' 'Nay, traytour, y the say, Thou schalt not passe fro me away.' Be the brydull he toke \u00fee stede: He had hym leuyr, \u00feen any mede. Wyth hys staffe Gye he smote, That he felyd hyt full hote. Gye seyde: '\u00feou doyst vncurteslye For to smyte me wrongeuslye.' Wyth hys horne Gye he b blotted out before Gye in MS. brake \u00fean Hys hedde vnto \u00fee brayne panne. 'Felowe, take \u00feou that therfore. Loke, \u00feou smyte no knyght no more.' \u00b6 Forthe he rode a gode spede, When he was lopyn on hys stede. He went the foreste nye abowte, Or he myght wende owte. He lokyd abowte hym on euery hande, But he knewe no\u00feyng of \u00feat lande: He sawe a towne be the way. He fasted all that same day. He had not redyn, but a whyle, Vnnethe \u00fee mowntawnce of a myle: He sawe a castell nerehande Feyre on an hylle stande. He hyed hym thedur faste rydande: He mett wyth oon of that lande. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'for thy lewte, Who owyth the &yogh;ondur cyte?' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y schall the say. A bettur lorde leuyth not to day: Men calle hym Florentyne. A better man dranke neuer wyne.' \u00b6 Gye rode to the castell gate: Porter fonde he none therate. He went to the halle &yogh;are And of hys stede he lyght thare. In he wente a gode pase: He fonde syttynge at the deyse An olde man, an hore knyght. He semyd of moche myght. To hym came syr Gye And gret hym full curteslye. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'herkyn to me: I am a kny&yogh;t of straunge cuntre. Yf hyt yowre wylle bee, I aske mete for charyte But for oon meel of thys day, And sythen y wyll wende away.' He seyde: 'syr, so mote y the, Thou art welcome vnto me.' \u00b6 He bad hys men and \u00feat in haste Go feche forthe of the beste. Gye ete faste on feyre manere Of hys mete wyth gode chere. He harde bellys faste rynge In the cyte wythowte cessynge. All, \u00feat \u00feere were, aferde was, For they harde soche noyse. 'Lady,' \u00feey seyde, 'heuyn quene, What may all thys sorowe bemeene?' \u00b6 Wyth \u00feat they come wyth sory chere And broght hys sone layde on a beere And leyde hym there in the halle. 'Lorde,' seyde he, '\u00feat boght vs all, Ys thys,' he seyde, 'my dere sone, That on beere ys thus come?' He drewe hys clo\u00feys and hys hare: He \u00feoght, hys herte my&yogh;t breke for care. 'Allas,' he seyde, 'my dere chylde, Who hath \u00fee slone in the felde? God, that dyed on a tree, Leve, he stode here be me: Y wolde not leeue for all \u00feys lande, But y wolde slee hym wyth myn hande.' \u00b6 Then bespake a squyere: 'He syttyth now before yow here. I knowe hym ryght wele: Y sawe that dede euery dele.' \u00b6 When \u00fee erle harde, \u00feat hyt so was, He starte hym vp fro the dayse. A spere he toke in hys hande And came to Gye rennande And seyde: 'traytour, \u00feou schalt dye here, For \u00feou slewe my sone dere.' Vp he drewe then hys arme: He \u00feoght to do Gye grete harme. Wyth grete wrath he can mynte, But he fayled of hys dynte. Halfe a fote the spere stode And into the borde wode. 'Syr,' quod Gye, 'for goddys mercye, Smyte not, but ye wott, why. If y haue slayne thy dere sone, Me defendawnt hyt was done.' \u00b6 Tho they lept Gye abowte, Knyghtys, \u00feat were styffe and stowte. Gye wanne hys schelde, \u00feere hyt stode, And in hys hande an axe gode. He turnedde hys rygge to a walle And hym defendyd for them all. Tho starte forthe the steward: Hyt semyd, he was no cowarde. Wyth a swyrde he smote Gye On the schelde hardelye. Wyth hys axe Gye to hym mynte: He fayled not of hys dynte. He claue hys hedde euyn in twaye: Hys lyfe he loste that ylke day. Gye wyth hys owne hande Defendyd hym wyth hys axe bytande. There he slewe knyghtys thre, The strengyst of all \u00feat cuntre. \u00b6 'Erle Florentyne,' seyde Gye, 'For the holy crosse loue, mercye! Thou art holdyn a doghty knyght, A wyse man of werre and fyght: Yf thou slee me in thys halle, All men wyll the traytour calle. Hyt were a a over the line in MS. grete schame vnto the, When \u00feou harbarowste me for charyte. Were hyt wyth ryght or wyth wronge, Hyt wolde \u00fee turne to schame stronge And moost of all in that case, When y at the mete was. Therfore do wythowte blame, That hyt turne not to no schame. Do me now to haue my stede And owte of the &yogh;ate me lede. Hyt were to the more honowre, Then y were slayne in thy towre.' \u00b6 The erle wythdrewe hym than. He was a sory man, When he sye \u00feem \u00feem is very probably miswritten for hym or for hys sone. \u00feere lye dedde. What he my&yogh;t do, he cowde no redde. 'Allas,' he seyde, 'and wele away! My sone ys dedde thys ylke day Now schall y euyr mare Leue in sorowe and in care.' He swownyd soone vpon the beere. Ther was no man in \u00feat place \u00feere, But of hym they had pyte. He comawndyd nys pyte blotted out after hys in MS. meyne, That none were so hardye To assayle hym before hys yee. He dud delyuer to hym hys stede And also all hys odur wede. When he were owt of the towre, He schulde be slayne wyth dyshonowre. \u00b6 Gye toke hys gode stede And on hym lepe, as he had nede. Hys swyrde he for&yogh;ate noght, And hys spere was to hym broght. Owte of the castell ys he gane: The wey he hath soone tane. Be \u00feat the erle was armed wele Bothe in yron and in stele. Faste he sewyd there syr Gye Wyth hys grete companye. Gye turned the hed of hys stede And farde, as \u00feat he wolde wede. He mett a knyght and smote hym sore, That he rose neuyr more. A nother there soone he smote. The erle came then full hote (To slee Gye he dud fonde) Wyth a spere in hys honde. Gye hym turned and dud hym see: To fyght wyth hym wolde he not flee. They faght togedur \u00feere full faste, Whyll \u00feere speres myght laste. The erle smote tho syr Gye Thorow the schelde hardelye. Gye smote at hym a nodur dynte: Hys hors and hym downe he tynte. \u00b6 Gye had pyte of that knyght, When he sawe, he had be of myght, m in myght uncertain in MS.: on might be read as well. And \u00feat he had hys sone slone. Twenty wyntur hyt was gone, Sythen he myght armes bere, Or helpe hymselfe in any were. Gye seyde: 'haue here thy stede And hye \u00fee whome a gode spede. Hyt were bettur for \u00fee to be in churche And holy werkys for to wyrche, Then to welde schelde or spere Or any armes blotted out after any. odur armes to bere.

Wyth the helpe of \u00feat cuntre They chasyd Gye grete plente. Gye rode faste thorow \u00feat londe: A grete foreste there he fonde. Ofte he turned them hys hys omitted in MS. vysage And dud them grete owtrage. Many a wownde awey \u00feey bere And many slayne eke in fere. \u00b6 Gye on hys stede rode faste: Fro \u00feem all soon he paste. The erle and hys companye, Ageyne they went hastelye. He toke hys sone, that was dedde, And beryed hym in a holy stedde. All that day Gye dud ryde (He wolde not there abyde), Tyll hyt were on a nodur morne: He sawe Loreyn hym beforne. He knewe that cuntre: He wente to that cyte. All hys men \u00feere he fonde, That were for hym sore dredeande. All they made gode chere, When \u00feey sawe Gye hole and fere. He tolde \u00feem all, or he wolde blynne, What parell that he was ynne. Then they \u00feankyd seynt Mychell, That he was delyuyrd so well. \u00b6 When he had a stownde dwellyd \u00feare, Into Ynglonde wolde he fare. He toke leue of dewke Loyere And he hym bad on feyre manere Of hys tresure for to take And \u00feat he schulde hyt not forsake. Of the tresure kepte he noght: On odur thynge was hys \u00feoght. To Tyrrye went Gyown And schewyd hym hys reson. 'Tyrrye,' he seyde, 'y wyl fare: Into Ynglonde y wyll &yogh;are For to see there my kynne To wyt, what state \u00feat \u00feey be ynne.

Dere brodur, let be thy care: Y wyll come ageyne full &yogh;are.' They kyste togedur ryght thore And wepte wyth ther eyen sore. Ther was none, when Gye dud goo, But he wepte wyth hys eyen twoo. \u00b6 Gye lepe on a softe palfray And he wente forthe on hys way. The erle lefte stylle thare: For Gye he made moche care. Gye, forthe euyr dud he ryde, Tyll he came to the see syde. A schyppe he fonde and gode fare: Into Ynglonde he came &yogh;are. To Wynchestur he came ryght: The kynge was \u00feere wyth myght. When he came to that cyte, Agenste hym came \u00fee kynge free. All the men of that cuntre Preysed Gye for hys bewte. The kynge hym nome abowte \u00fee halse And wyth yoye h blotted out before yoye in MS. he kyste hym alse. All men of hym had ferlye, That he had passed so, syr Gye. \u00b6 At the chesses vpon a day Gye wyth the kynge dud play. Then came knyghtys prekande: 'Syr,' they seyde, 'here tythande. A beste ys comen to the lande: Ther may no man agenste hym stande. He ys comyn fro Yrelande: Moche care he bryngy\u00fe on hande. He sleyth bothe beste and man And all, that euer he fynde can. He ys a dredefull beste: Hys hedde ys black and wyth \u00fee meste; Hys wombe ys black, hys rygg donne, Hys body ys gretter \u00feen a tonne. Wyngys he hath on euery syde: Hys body ys longe and vnryde (Skales he hath all abowte: Of no wepon he \u00fear not dowte), Hys breste brode and black skynne. At hys mowthe a stede myght ynne. Powes he hath, as a lyon. He ys an vgle, fowle dragon. Hys tayle ys grete and \u00feerto longe. Ther ys no kny&yogh;t halfe so stronge, Were he armed neuer so wele, But, and \u00fee dragon hyt hym wele Wyth hys tayle a lytull mynte, But he schulde dye of that dynte.' \u00b6 When the kynge harde well, What they seyde, euery dell, He was in sorowe stronge: He myght not speke aftur longe. 'Syr,' seyde Gye, 'let be thy thoght: Of \u00feat beste drede the noght. I schall wende to that cuntre And, yf that beste fowndyn bee, I schall hym sloo wyth force and myght And come ageyne anon ryght.' 'Nay,' seyde the kynge to Gyown, 'Ye schall not wende owt of \u00feys towne, But wyth yow an hundurd kny&yogh;tys or two: All the sykerer may ye goo.' Gye hym answeryd hastelye: 'God forbede and seynt Marye, That for a beste all oonlye Men schulde brynge soche compenye.' \u00b6 Gye toke hys leue wythowten more, And to hys ynne he went thore. He hym dyght soone that day: To that beste he toke \u00fee way. Hys felows wolde wyth hym wende: He wolde not let \u00feem, so god me mende. Wolde he none let wyth hym goo, But syr Harrowde and odur twoo. \u00b6 When he \u00feedur came, syr Gye, There he sawe the beste lye, Gye hym armed soone then: Sythen he comawndyd all hys men, That none were so hardye To come to hym, \u00feogh he schulde dye. Vndur an hylle went syr Gye, There as, he sawe, \u00fee beste dud lye. Gye sate vpon hys stede: Of hym he had grete drede. He smote hym wyth hys spere faste: Hyt brake in pecys at the laste. So thyck was hys skynne, That he my&yogh;t not thorow wynne. \u00b6 When the beste feled the dynte, Wyth hys hedde he dud mynte. To Gye he starte, as he wolde wede, And smote hym downe and hys stede. There was Gye stonyed sore: Soche a dynte had he neuer ore. Gye starte vp and lay not longe. 'God,' he seyde, 'of myght so stronge, That madyst bothe day and nyght And dyed on tre for synfull wyght And sauyd Sampson fro the lyon, Kepe me to day fro thys dragon.' \u00b6 Hys swyrde anon he drewe owte: To \u00feat beste he starte full stowte. Before the hedde dud he smyte, But the swyrde wolde not byte. So grete wondur had Gye there, That no wepon myght hym dere. He was now in batell stronge: The dragon faght agenste hym longe. As Gye assayled hym in the place, Hym befelle auenturs case: So nye Gye the beste wente, That wyth hys pawes he hym rente The pecys of hys hawberke, That was bo\u00fee stalworthe and starke. In aventure was Gye than: To a tre faste he ranne To loke, yf he myght better fare, And for to defende hym thare. He on Gye faste dud bete And wyth hys tayle faste he dud hym smete Thorow \u00fee schelde in a stownde, That Gye felle flat to \u00fee grownde. \u00b6 Than there a lytull whyle Gye was in grete paryle: He foldyd hys tayle hym abowte, That he myght not on no syde owte. Hys tayle was grett and vnryde: He brake two rybbes in Gyes syde. Gye seyde: 'y am but dedde, But god sende me \u00fee bettur redde.' He smote hym \u00feere wyth all hys myght Aboue \u00fee tayle in two full ryght. Wyth grete angwysche and wyth woo At \u00feat tyme he wanne hym fro. Then perseyuyd Gye full wele, That no wepon made of stele Fro the tayle to the heuydde MS. hedde. Myght hym not \u00fee lyfe haue reuydde. \u00b6 The beste hym felyd smetyn sore: He caste a crye and a rore. Thorow \u00feat cuntre was the dynne: All myght here, \u00feat was \u00feerynne. Ther was no man, \u00feat herde \u00feat crye, But that they wente for to dye. &YOGH;yt ranne Gye abowte the tre: He \u00feoght, fro hym he wolde not fle. fle written twice, but the first time blotted out. Hys hawberke \u00feere was all torente: Hys body was full nere schente. At the laste Gye hym bethoght, To smyte before hyt helpy\u00fe noght. As the dragon was turnande, Gye had hys swyrde in hys hande: Euyn betwene the wyngys twoo He smote the body almoste a too. He felle downe and myght no more, But beganne to crye and rore. Gye wythdrewe hym sone than MS. then. : For grete stynke he was nye slane. MS. slayne. He restyd hym vpon the playne: Of hys dede he was full fayne. \u00b6 When Gye had rested hym well, He rose and mett hym euery delle: Syxty fote was he longe. Therof men had wondur stronge: All, that came be the way, Wondurd on hym, \u00feere he lay. The hedde of soone he schare. To the kynge a man hyt bare: To &YOGH;orke the hed dud he brynge And presentyd hyt to the kynge, And wyth a grete precessyowne They broght Gye to the towne. At &YOGH;orke the hed was hangyd \u00fean: Theron lokyd many a man. \u00b6 He toke leue at \u00fee kynge thare And to Walyngforde dud he fare. The kynge was then full blythe And thankyd god fele sythe. Longe was paste, wythowte lesynge, Or he of hym harde more tythynge. Hys fadur was dedde longe gone: Odur heyre, heyre and he omitted in MS. bote he, heyre and he omitted in MS. was ther none. \u00b6 Gye callyd Harrowde on a day, That hym had seruyd aye: He gaue hym \u00fee castell and \u00fee towre And all hys londe wyth honowre. To euery knyght ferre and nere, Lesse and more, that wyth hym were, That had bene wyth hym in fyght, He gaue \u00feem waryson full ryght. \u00b6 To Warwyk dud he wende And \u00feere he fonde \u00fee erle so hende, That honowred hym wyth hys myght: So dud all the londe, baron and knyght. The erle dud hym honowre aye And wolde not leue hym an owre of a day: They went to \u00fee wode and to \u00fee ryvere To solace them on all manere. \u00b6 He tolde Felyce all hys wylle and lyfe, And, how he was bedyn ryche wyfe, Kyngys doghtur and emperowre, And wyth hur moche honowre: 'Of them all wolde y noght, For on yow was all my thoght.' \u00b6 'Syr,' sche seyde, 'gramercye! I yow sey, sekerlye: For me \u00feer hath be preyere Of kynge and dewke ferre and nere. Of them all wolde y nane: Ye had my loue wyth yow tane. I am yowrys (hyt ys skylle) To do wyth me at yowre wylle.' \u00b6 Gye hur kyste wyth yoye than: He was neuer so gladde a man. He toke hys leue and home wente: Of myrthe and yoye was hys entente. He made yoye nyght and day, When he was seker of \u00feat maye. \u00b6 Hyt happenyd, \u00fee erle calde hys doghtere And resonyd hur on hys manere And seyde: 'doghtur, odur heyre haue y noon Nor neuer schall haue, but \u00fee allone. Hyt were tyme, \u00feou toke an husbonde Aftur my day to kepe my londe. Dewkys dyuers of farre cuntre Haue comen for to aske the: Of \u00feem all wolde \u00feou none. How longe schalt \u00feou maydyn gone?' 'Syr, y schall yow the sothe say Be the space of the thrydde day.' \u00b6 When the \u00ferydde day was gone, The erle came ageyne anone. 'Doghtur, now wyll y wytt, Haste \u00feou takyn \u00fey cowncell &yogh;yt?' 'Syr,' sche seyde, 'blame me noght, Yf that y telle yow now my thoght.

'Doghtur,' he seyde, 'for thy reson Haue \u00feou goddys benyson, When \u00feou desyrest soche a knyght, That may mayntene MS. maytene. my londe wyth ry&yogh;t.

Then, y wott, y schall be slone And my sonnes euerychone. Of my lyfe yeue y noght, But for my sonnes ys all my thoght. They were knyghtys bolde and wyght And well defendyd \u00feem in euery fyght.

Now to hym wyll y fare And take my dethe ryght thare.' \u00b6 Wyth that he swownyd before Gye, And therfore he was sorye. Gye had sorow and moche care, For he sawe the erle so fare. 'Leue pylgryme,' seyde Gye, 'That for thy sonnes art sorye And Gye and Harrowde bo\u00fee haste soght In far londys and fonde \u00feem noght, Yf thou haue dole, hyt ys no ferlye, When \u00feou mayste \u00feem nowhere aspye: Thorow \u00feem \u00feou wenyst delyuerd to be Owte of pryson and thy sonnes fre.

Hys body, he \u00feoght, was feyre and longe And wele ymade to be stronge: Hys bones were bare of flesche. He semyd all of wyldurnesse: Hys berde was longe, Perhaps we ought to add and after longe. fowle farande. He lokyd vp steype starande. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'for thy reson Haue thou goddys beneson. Thou knowest not \u00feat sarsyne, That ys so wyckyd and so kene: Had he ones lokyd vpon the Wyth hys eyen, wytterle, He wolde the agaste make, That \u00feou schuldyst the batayle MS. hym, but Caius MS., p. 165: That thow shuldyst the bateyle forsake. forsake.' \u00b6 Then seyde Gye: '\u00feerof drede \u00fee noght. God ys my&yogh;tfull, \u00feat ys my thoght. Many haue prouyde to do skathe And wyth \u00feer eyen lokyd wrathe: MS. rathe; but Caius MS., p. 165: And wyth hys eyen lokyd wrathe.

Yf \u00feou thynke, y febull bee, God ys soche of poste, That he may geue me grace and myght To slee \u00fee gyawnt in \u00fee fyght.' 'Syr,' seyde \u00fee pylgryme, 'gramercye! God, that borne was of Marye, &YOGH;ylde hyt the, or \u00feou be dedde.' For yoye he swownyd in \u00feat stedde. \u00b6 Tho seyde Gye: Gye omitted in MS. Cf. the Caius MS., p. 166: 'My frende,' quod Gye, 'so haue i hele. 'as haue y hele, Let vs go forthe, we schall fare wele.' To Alysawnder \u00feey can \u00feem dyght: Before \u00fee kynge \u00feey came full ryght. When the kynge Joonas sawe, Full soone \u00feere he dud hym knowe. 'Jonas,' seyde the kynge than, 'Where ys Gye, that nobull man, And Harrowde, \u00feat \u00feou haste soght? Haste \u00feou any of them broght?' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'y schall the saye: I wyll not lye, be thys day. Y haue bene in many a cuntre: Harrowde nor Gye y my&yogh;t not see. I was farre in many a londe And askyd euery man, \u00feat y fonde. They seyde, he was in exsyle wente, Therfore the londe was nye schente; And seyde, Harrowde had take \u00fee way To seke Gye nyght and day. But y haue broght a nobull knyght, In armes \u00feat ys bolde and wyght: For yow he schall do thys batayle Thorowe helpe of god and not fayle. He wyll defende \u00fee full ryght And wyth \u00fee gyawnt wyll he fyght.' \u00b6 Tho seyde \u00fee kynge to erle Joonas: 'Loke, \u00feou lye not in thys case. Yf y be betrayed thorow the, Hongyd hye schalt thou bee, And \u00fey sonnes euerychone Wyth \u00fee the same wey schall gone.' 'I grawnte,' quod Joonas, 'that ye saye. God vs helpe, that beste maye.' \u00b6 The kynge clepyd soon Gyown And tolde hym there all hys reson. 'Pylgryme,' he seyde, 'what ys \u00fey name?' And he hym tolde, but not \u00fee same. 'Frende,' seyde tho the kynge, 'Telle me wythowte lesynge, Where haste \u00feou bene and in what lande? Was \u00feer \u00feere no corne growande?' Perhaps corrupt. Cf. Caius MS., p. 167: Was there no brede ne corne growande? 'Syr,' quod he, 'syth y was knyght, Here the MS. is evidently corrupt; giving a single line instead of three. Cf. Caius MS., p. 167: 'Sir,' he seyd, 'in Englonde Was i borne and moste dwellande: Sethen that i was dubbyd kny&yogh;te, I haue bene in meny fyght.' I haue bene in mony a fyght.' \u00b6 'Art \u00feou Englysche,' seyde the kynge, 'Me oght to hate \u00fee ouer all thynge. Knewe thou oght syr Gyowne And wyth hym Harrawde, \u00feat bolde baron? Yf that \u00feey be nowe leueande, They be full bolde and stronge of hande. I oght to hate Gye wyth yre: He slewe my fadur, Clynant of Tyre, And my neme wyth hys hande And \u00fee sowdan at mete syttande. I sawe hym smyte of hys hedde, And wyth strenckyth awey hyt ledde. Awey he pryckyd at the laste, All we chacyd hym full faste. The deuell hym saued: we slewe hym not \u00fean, But he slewe of vs many a man. Lorde geue, that he were here: Then schulde y make gladde chere. Yf he wolde fyght for me, All forgeuyn schulde hyt bee.' \u00b6 Tho Gye answeryd curteslye: 'Well,' quod he, 'knowe y syr Gye And Harrowde also, so mote y goo: I knowe \u00feem wele bothe twoo. Yf ye had owder Harrowde or Gye, Ye myght be sekur of vyctorye.' \u00b6 'Telle me,' seyde the kynge than, 'Why art thou so lene a man? Vnkynde men thou seruest aye, When \u00feou partyste so pore awaye; Odur hyt ys for thy folye, That \u00feou fareste so porelye.' 'Hyt may,' quod he, 'full wele befalle, My state knowe ye not &yogh;yt all. I was some tyme in gode MS. goddys. Cf. Caius MS., p. 168: For soth, i was in good servyse. seruyse: My lorde me louyd in all wyse. For hym y had grete honowre Of kynge, prynce and maydyns in bowre. But ones y dud an hastenesse: Therfore y loste bo\u00fee more and lesse. Sythen y went fro my cuntre.' After this five lines have been omitted in the MS., at the end of the fifth of which there was another cuntre. Line 7839 has been added after this omission. See the note. \u00b6 Then to hym spake \u00fee kynge free: 'Telle me \u00fee so\u00fee, so mote \u00feou the. Wylt \u00feou take \u00fee batell for me? Or ellys y schall gete a nodur. Telle me \u00fee sothe, lefe brodur.' And Gye seyde: '\u00feerfore come y hedur, Joonas and y now togedur. Thorow \u00fee helpe of \u00fee trynyte The batell y schall take for the And slo \u00fee gyawnt wyth my hande, Yf ye wyll graunt me \u00feys couenande, That Joonas and hys sonnes echone Fro pryson be delyuyrde anon.' \u00b6 Then seyde the kynge: 'y \u00fee grawnte. Mahownde \u00fee helpe and Termagawnte.' 'Nay,' seyde Gye, 'but MS. be. Cf. the Caius MS., p. 169: 'Nay,' quod Gye, 'but Mary is sonne. Mary sone, That for vs on a rode was done: He may me helpe for hys mercye. Syr kynge, y sey, that ys no lye, But that Mahownde ha\u00fe no poste To helpe nodur the nor me.' \u00b6 Then seyde \u00fee kynge: 'my frende dere, I schall make \u00fee a couenande here. Yf \u00feou may the gyawnt sloo And brynge me owte of thys woo, Thy god for the loue of the Schall haue also \u00fee loue of me. The crysten men, that y haue tane, Schall be delyuyrde euery man. Ther schall be none in he\u00feynnes, Man nor woman, more nor lesse, That ys of crystyante, But they schall delyuyrde bee. For \u00fee and for \u00fey goddys sake I schall in thys londe make, That crysten men schall wende Thorow \u00feys londe feyre and hende, And, yf any be so hardye To do \u00feem schame and vylenye, Be he neuer so grete nor so stowte, He schall dye, wythowte dowte.' 'Syr,' seyde Gye, 'gramercye! Thys ys a feyre gyfte for me.' \u00b6 The kyng bad, he schulde ba\u00feed be, 'And geue hym robes grete plente: Loke, \u00feat he wante noght.' But Gye had of \u00feat no thoght. 'Syr kynge,' he seyde, 'of \u00feat be stylle Hyt ys nothynge at my wylle Ryche robes for to haue: I am but a pore knaue. Mete and drynke geue me my fylle, And \u00feen y haue all my wylle.' The kynge bad, \u00feat he schulde haue, What some euer he wolde craue. \u00b6 When \u00fee tyme was comen sone, That \u00fee batell schulde be done, The kynge was full rychely dyght And wyth hym all hys baronage wy&yogh;t: To \u00fee sowdan wolde he fare. Swy\u00fee he wente and came full &yogh;are. Gye wente armed and wele ydyght, As felle to a gentyll knyght. On hym he had an hawberke: Hyt was made of ryche warke. In farre londe hyt was wroght And to \u00fee kynge in present broght. When hyt came to Jerusalem, Hyt was bryght, as sonne beme. A thefe hyt stale sythen wyth honde And broght hyt vnto hethyn londe. The aunceturs of kynge Tryamowre Boght hyt wyth moche honowre. Hyt was of grete tresorye And in \u00feat nede was geuyn to Gye. Thretty wyntur was gone and more, That hyt came in no felde &yogh;ore. Hyt was so clere and so bryght, That all \u00fee halle schone of \u00fee lyght. \u00b6 He had an helme of olde warke And on euery syde stones starke. He, that on hys hedde hyt bare, Schulde not be vencowsde in no warre. Hyt was Alysawndurs, \u00fee kynge: He wanne hyt in hys fyghtynge. When he slewe kynge Pore, MS. fawre. See the note. He wanne hyt and moche more. He bare a swyrde in hys hande: Ector hyt oght, y vndurstande. There were Gregyows many a wonne, Or he hyt gate, that were slone. He had also a nobull targe: Hyt was bothe bryght and large. Ther was no\u00feyng, \u00feat my&yogh;t hyt dere, Knyfe, swyrde, axe nor spere. \u00b6 When he was dyght, syr Gye, Of hym all men had farlye. Echeon askyd, what he myght bee, Fro whens he came and fro what cuntre, That schulde for the kynge fyght. They sawe neuer so semelye a knyght. \u00b6 Then seyde the kynge to \u00fee sowdan: 'Herkyn me, syr, and that anon Now y am comen to the here To defende me on all manere Of that wyckyd felonye, That was put on me vntrewlye, Thorow \u00fee knyght, \u00feat stondyth here, That Sowdan, thy sone dere, Thorow my sone was neuer dedde Nodur \u00feorow my cowncell nor my redde.' The sowdan seyde: 'syn \u00feou haste hym broght, Hyt schall soone be sene, so ys my thoght. \u00b6 Brynge forthe,' he seyde, 'the gyawnt,' A paynym, that hyght Amerawnt. He was armed nobullye: Euery man of hym had farlye. Hys body was bo\u00fee grete and longe: He semed to be owtrageus stronge. A word blotted out before stronge in MS. But, when Gye sye that sarsyn, That was so myghty and so kene, 'Be Cryste,' he seyde vnto \u00fee kynge \u00fean, '&YOGH;ondur ys \u00fee deuell and no man. Who schulde hym a stroke stande? He wolde hym felle wyth hys hande. \u00b6 Forthe \u00feey wente to that batayle Hastelye, wythowte fayle, To an yle besyde the see, There the batayle schulde bee. When \u00feey came \u00feere, as \u00feey shulde fyght, They lepe on \u00feer stedys full ryght. Soone \u00feey smote togedur faste, Whyll \u00feer sperys wolde laste. Soone \u00feer sperys dud glyde Abowte \u00feer hedys in pecys wyde. Soone \u00feey drewe \u00feer swyrdys of stele And faght togedur faste and wele. \u00b6 Amerawnt drewe hys swyrde owte: Hyt was scharpe all abowte. Hyt was Arcules swyrde \u00fee wyght: He hyt bare in euery fyght And \u00feerwyth slewe many a man. Amerawnt hyt in warre wanne. Hyt was put in the watur of helle; For hyt was bo\u00fee scharpe and felle. God of heuyn thynke on Gye; For he came to hym full hastelye. \u00b6 Togedur soone dud they smyte Wyth brondys, \u00feat full wele cowde byte. Wyth grete wrath starte Amerawnt Wyth hys strenkyth Gye sayleant. He smote hym on the helme bryght, That was made of stele ryght, That \u00fee flowrys felle all abowte, And hys schelde he smote \u00feorowowte, That was neuyr peyred are In stryfe nor in warre, but thare. Thorow \u00fee sadull he smote also The gode stede euyn in twoo. The swyrde felle downe \u00feore Into \u00fee erthe two fote and more. Gye was at \u00fee grownde anon; Hys gode stede \u00feere was slone. \u00b6 'Lorde,' quod Gye, 'god almyght, That made bo\u00fee \u00fee day and nyght, Schelde me fro schame thys day, As \u00feat \u00feou of all beste may. Kepe me, for thy holy grace, That y be not slayne in thys place.' On hys fote he starte vp ryght, As a nobull doghty knyght. He toke hys bronde wyth envye And smote to \u00fee gyawnt hardelye. On \u00fee helme the stroke glode: Besyde \u00fee gyawnt downe hyt rode. Hys hors neck he smote in two: The gyawnt to \u00fee grownde felle \u00feo. Vp he starte wythowte lettynge, But he playned hym nothynge. He smote Gye wyth hys myght And he hym kepte, as a nobull kny&yogh;t. Then \u00feey faght faste thare: Ther wolde nodur odur spare. They faght togedur wyth grete yre: Of \u00feer helmes sprange \u00fee fyre. Ther strokys breke styffe scheldys, That \u00fee mayles flewe to \u00fee feldys. \u00b6 Amerawnt ha\u00fe hym bethoght, That in many a stowre he had foght, But neuer are before that day Was he so stadde in no jurnaye. Therfore hys armes he lyfte vp ryght And smote Gye wyth all hys myght: Gye was bothe stronge and lyght And kept hym, MS. hyt. as a nobull knyght. Then they faght so faste thare, That nodur of \u00feem wolde odur spare. He smote Gye on the hedde tho, That the perlys dud downe goo, At the drawyng of that bronde That Gye on hys kneys felle to grounde. \u00b6 Vp he starte, as a man, But hyt greuyd hym sore than. Greuyd was Gye sore: 'Lorde Cryste,' he seyde, 'thy nore. Neuyr in batayle nor in no fyght Knelyd y are for dynte of knyght.' He lyfte vp tho hys hande And smote vnto Amerawnde In the helme, that clere was, That golde felle downe a gode pase; The mayles he smote also in twoo. Then was Amerawnt full woo, That nothynge helped the mayle, But all tobrake hys ventayle. He hyt hys flesche: \u00fee blode downe ranne. Hys necke he made lyke no man. Hys targe, \u00feat was golde belokyn, Hyt was all tofruschyd and brokyn. To \u00fee bokull, \u00feat was golde begone, He made hys bronde to go anon. Sythen he brayde ageyne soo, To \u00fee grownde \u00feat he dud goo On kneys and on handys also, As he had had no frendys tho. Amerawnt dud, as a gode knyght: He lyfte hys swyrde anon ryght. Gye sore there he smote: So eydur odur, wele y wote. Of ther helmes flewe the fyre: So faste they faght wyth grete yre. Betwene \u00feem was so grete fyght, That no man \u00fee bettur knowe myght. So stronge batayle was neuer made: Of \u00feem, \u00feat hyt sye, hyt was so sayde. \u00b6 Hyt was in somer, the wedur was hote: The story so tellyth, wele y wote. On \u00fee morne aftur mydsomyr day, As we in boke telle yow may, Was the batell of the barons, That frescher were, \u00feen any lyons. Amerawnt drewe hym ageyne And helde hys hedde, as men seyne. What for blode, \u00feat he had leuyd, And what for yre, \u00feat he was greuyd, Thurste he had euellye: But yf he dranke, he muste dye. 'Telle thou me, syr knyght,' quod he, 'Of whens \u00feou art and of what cuntre. Art thou Gye of Warwyke, That, men sey, ther ys none lyke? I wolde fayne fyght wyth hym, For he hath slayne mony of my kynne. Hys hedde y schulde smyte of here: He schulde neuyr moo men dere. Of vs he slewe twenty thousande Wyth hys dyntes Perhaps Wyth the dyntes? of hys hande. Yf that y had hym ones slayne And syr Harrowde, \u00feat ys hys swayne, Two the beste then slayne had y: Then myght y be full yolye.' \u00b6 'Now \u00fee deuell,' quod Gye, '\u00fee honge: Dud he the euyr any wronge, That thou wolde hys hed of smyte? Of synne \u00feou art gretly to wyte.' He seyde: 'nay,' wyth moche vnwynne, 'But he hath mysdone to my kynne. \u00b6 Crysten man, vndurstande me: The wedur ys hote, as \u00feou may see.

And, yf thurste vpon the falle, &YOGH;eue \u00fee leue to drynke y schall.' Then seyde Gye: 'y grawnte the To drynke ynogh in safete, So that efte \u00feou geue me leue For to drynke, yf \u00feurste me greue.' \u00b6 But, when \u00feat he the leue hadde, He was neuer before so gladde. He ranne to \u00fee watur, wythowte fayle, And vnlasyd hys ventayle, There as he was moste hate: For to drynke ynogh he thrate. 'Kny&yogh;t,' seyde \u00fee gyawnt, '&yogh;elde \u00fee to me: Thy endynge day thou haste ysee. Euyll y haue begyled the, When \u00feou to drynke leue gaue me.

My custome ys soche, y the say: Fyght y neuer so moche on a day, And y myght haue ony space My mouthe to wete wyth ony gras, Sythen anon geue y no tale To fyght, where that euer y schale.' Then seyde Gye: 'no\u00feyng drede y \u00fee. Line 8145 after 8146 in MS. That \u00feynge getyst \u00feou not of me.' \u00b6 Togedur they streke, as ye may herke, And on \u00fee helmes strokes they marke. Nother flewe a strawe brede: In \u00feat tyme no dethe they drede. Togedur \u00feey smeten to make \u00feem tame: On ther bodyes \u00feey dud schame. In pecys scheuyrde \u00feey \u00feer scheldus: They schente \u00feer vysage wyth \u00feer swyrdus. Amerawnt greuyd tho full hote And on the hedde Gye he smote. The pomell, \u00feat on \u00fee helme was, In sonder was smyten into \u00fee place. The dynte felle on Gyes schoulder: Hys hawberke he smote \u00feere in sonder. Wyth that he brake an hole wyde And woundyd Gye in the syde. In the &yogh;orthe a fote he smote: Of that men spake, wele y wote. Of that dynte Gye wondur hadde, That euer he myght set ony so sadde. Gye hym to &yogh;elde had grete desyre And Amerawnt he smote wyth grete yre: Wythynne the schelde a fote and more Hys swyrde hyt and bote sore. Sythen ageyn he hyt droghe, As a man, that was wery ynogh. \u00b6 Then seyde Gye to Amerawnt thore: 'To the y telle wythowten more: Soche a thurste ys me befalle, But yf y drynke, y dye wythalle. Therfore, Amerawnt, y prey to the, Of me \u00feou woldyst haue pyte. Now that boone thou quyte me, That \u00feou are behyghtest me, That y to drynke leue schulde haue, At what tyme y wolde hyt craue.' Amerawnt seyde: 'was \u00feat \u00fey thoght?

He seyde: 'Gye, welcome mote \u00feou bee. Ouyr all thynge desyred y the. Now wot y well, that sothe hyt ys, That men haue spokyn of \u00fee or \u00feys.

Amerawnt folowed wyth hys swyrde: Gye was then sore aferde. Of the watur he was fayne. But god hym helpe, he ys but slayne. Now ys Gye bestadde sore, In \u00fee water to \u00fee gyrdull and more. Into \u00fee watur hys hedde he threste To \u00fee schoulders, or he wolde reste, And Amerawnt smote hym soo, That in \u00fee water he knelyd thoo: The colde water abowte hym ranne. Gye start vp then, as a man. Then seyde Gye, that all myght here: 'Thou haste me hyt on ylle manere. Thou haste me baptysed, hyt ys \u00fey schame. But &yogh;yt \u00feou haste not chaunged my name.' \u00b6 Forthe of the water he came, y wote, And Amerawnt full soone he smote. Eyther hath other bethoght, How \u00feey myght to grownde be broght. Of acorde was not speke: Eyther of odur wolde be awreke. 'A, felle fende,' seyde syr Gye, 'Thankyd be god full hastelye. Thorow \u00fee water at \u00fee brymme I was well holpyn soone \u00feerynne.

'Erle,' seyde tho the kynge, 'Thou schalt be my darlynge.' \u00b6 The kynge seyde: 'lorde, \u00feat \u00fee wroght, Geue, hyt were in thy thoght To dwelle stylle here wyth me.

I can not thynke, but he ys dedde, And therfore sorowfull ys my redde.' Therwythall he wepyd sare: He was full of sorowe and care. \u00b6 When Gye sye Tyrrye, \u00fee knyght, That was so doghty and so wyght, That he louyd so trewlye, He lokyd on hym soberlye. He was pore for \u00fee nones, He had no\u00feynge to hylle hys bones: Hys lymmes were bare and euyll beseyn, That some tyme were clad in scarlet in greyne. For dole Gye felle to the grownde: Ofte he swowned in that stownde. When Tyrrye hym sye falle to grownde, He toke hym vp in that stownde. Tyrrye seyde: 'be of gode harte.

But y reue Barrarde hys lyfe Odur wyth swyrde or wyth knyfe And venge Tyrrye, my gode felowe, God let neuer me of gode knowe.' Then spake Gye to syr Tyrrye: 'Pylgryme, be not sorye.

We wyll drawe nerehande, That we may here tythande, That we may the better bee.' 'Syr,' seyde Tyrrye, 'so schall hyt be.' \u00b6 They toke the wey to the cyte, And a sory man was Tyrrye. Gye goyth Tyrrye comfortynge, But in hys harte he made morenyng. Gye to wepe forbare nothynge, When he sawe Tyrrye so faste wepynge: He couyrde hys face wyth hys slaveyne, That Tyrrye schulde not knowe hys peyne. They were gone but myles thre In the way to that cyte: 'Lorde,' seyde Tyrrye, 'what schall y do? Heuynes ys comen me too. But y slepe here a whyle, I dye, or y haue gone a myle.' 'Syr,' seyde Gye, 'lye down stylle A throwe and slepe all \u00fey fylle. I schall for \u00fee loue of the At thy hedde reste me.' 'Syr,' seyde Tyrrye, 'gramercye! Thou doyst to me grete curtesye.' \u00b6 Now lythe Tyrrye on \u00fee grownde And slepyd but a lytull stownde. Also faste as Tyrrye dud slepe, Also faste can Gye wepe. As Tyrrye lay in slomerynge, Owt of hys mow\u00fee wente a \u00feynge Also whyte, as any armyne. Gye lokyd theron wele and fyne. To an hylle went hyt than And in at an hole hyt ranne. Hyt dwellyd not longe, os y yow say: Ageyn hyt came soon \u00feat same day. In at \u00fee mowthe dud hyt goo, There as hyt came froo. When Gye had \u00feat syght sene, He had wondur, what hyt my&yogh;t mene. mene altered from men in MS. Cf. 8400. \u00b6 Tyrrye wakenyd soone thore: Vp he rose and sykyd sore. 'A, lorde,' he seyde, 'heuyn kynge, I haue a grete wonderynge. Me \u00feoght, y was on a hylle gone And y fonde \u00feere a roche of stone: Full hyt was of golde redde, And there lay a dragon dedde. A bryght swyrde be hym lay: Ther ys none bettur in \u00fee worlde \u00feys day. Also me thoght, that syr Gye Was here be me, full sekerlye, And my hed in hys armes lay: Me \u00feoght, my sorowe was away.' Tho seyde Gye: 'my dere frende, Thorow \u00fee grace of god so hende Schalt \u00feou wynne \u00feorow Gyown All thy londe, castell and towne.

'I graunte,' quod Tyrrye, 'be \u00feys day: Goo we \u00feedur wythowte ony more delaye.' \u00b6 To the hylle \u00feey came hastelye And fonde the hole, certenlye, As Tyrrye had thoght beforehande: The tresure, \u00fee swyrde \u00feere \u00feey fonde. The swyrde was styffe ynoghe: Owte of \u00fee sche\u00fee Gye hyt droghe. 'God of heuyn,' seyde Gye than, 'Was ther neuyr crysten man, That had any soche bronde. Y trowe, hyt came fro far londe.' The poynte was couyrde euery dele Wyth bryght golde gayly wele. Of \u00feat swyrde was Gye fayne: He put hyt into \u00fee skabarde agayne, And sythen he seyde to Tyrrye: 'That tresure, \u00feat \u00feou seyst there lye, Take hyt vnto thy poste; For \u00fee swyrde schall byde wyth me.' Tho seyde Tyrrye: 'at yowre wylle. Of tresure haue y my fylle. Ther ys so moche dole in my thoght, That of no tresure yf y noght. To that cyte wyll we gone: Me \u00feynkyth, we be to longe fro home.' \u00b6 'I graunte,' in haste seyde syr Gye: Bothe they wente forthe in hye. Then wenyd Tyrrye knowen to haue be Of some man, \u00feat hym had see. When they came to that cyte, A sory man was erle Tyrrye. They were harbarowde at \u00fee townes ende And aftur mete dud they sende. \u00b6 Gye rose vp, full hardelye, And lefte hys swyrde wyth Tyrrye. He hyed faste to the towre To speke wyth the emperowre. The emperowre fro the churche come, Gye hym kepyd sone and anon; And Gye hym grett hendelye, As a man, that cowde of curtesye. 'God saue he blotted out before \u00fee in MS. \u00fee,' he seyde, 'syr emperowre. Ye be a man of grete valowre, And y am pore and of far cuntre: I aske the gode for charyte. Of yowre helpe y haue mystere, As ye may se, in all manere.' The emperowre answeryd: 'gladlye I wyll \u00fee helpe, be seynt Marye. To the pales come wyth me: Thou schalt haue mete to plese \u00fee.' \u00b6 When \u00feey were comen to \u00fee halle, The emperowre and hys meyne all, The lordys to the mete yode, And Gye there before \u00feem stode. 'Pylgryme,' seyde the emperowre, 'Telle me, y prey \u00fee pur amowre. Thou semeste trauelde for to be: Where were \u00feou borne and in what cuntre?' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'ye schall vndurstande, That y haue be in mony a lande: In Jerusalem and in Surrye And in Costantyne \u00fee nobull, sekerlye.' \u00b6 'Pylgryme,' he seyde, 'be thy lewte, What sey men \u00feere of me?' 'Syr,' he seyde, 'ye schall here: Schame and skathe on all manere, When ye thorow wyckyd cownceyle Of yowre steward, \u00feat may may in the same hand over my&yogh;t blotted out. not avayle, That ye For That ye we ought perhaps to read Haue.

He fared, as a wode man, And wolde haue smeten Gye than, But he hym helde, \u00feat stode hym bye, That he dud Gye no vylanye. He seyde: 'thou lyest, traytowre. Yf hyt were not for the dyshonowre Of my lorde, the emperowre, Thou schuldyst haue a scharpe schowre.

I sawe yow neuer are, syr, verelye: Ye seme bothe bolde and hardye. To do a pylgryme skathe vtterlye To yow hyt were grete vylenye.

Cf. line 9332, and the Caius MS. p. 219: He slew neuer the duke Otoun. slewe \u00fee dewke Oton, That was \u00fee felle and false gloton.' Probably corrupt. See the note. Gye seyde to the emperowre: 'Take here my wedde, for your honowre; For wyth hym wyll y fyght To helpe Tyrrye in hys ryght.' \u00b6 Tho vp start then that syre, That was full of farvente yre.

The emperowre clepyd hys doghtur dere And bad hur on all manere, That sche schulde kepe \u00fee pylgryme wele And arme hym bo\u00fee in yron and stele. After this line follows the catchword To a chaumbur sche in another hand. To a chaumbur sche hym ladde And dud, as hur fadur hur badde. He preyed hur for godys loue of myght To arme hym well at all ryght. \u00b6 All men, that dud hym see, Had wondur and grete pyte, That he durste agenste Barrarde fyght. They preyed to god full of myght, That he schulde geue \u00fee pylgryme grace To ouercome Barrarde in the place. \u00b6 &YOGH;erly rose the emperowre And masse he herde wyth honowre. To hys pales he ys gone And hys barons euerychone, And redy was there Barrarde Also ferse, as any lybarde, Armed on a gode stede. To the courte \u00feey dud hym lede.

The lordys seyde: 'we assente, We graunte to hyt wyth gode entente.' \u00b6 They wente \u00feedur, \u00fee batell shulde bee, On an hylle besyde the cyte.

They tolde hym, \u00feat hyt was nyght, They myght see no more to fyght. \u00b6 The emperowre clepyd in \u00feat stowre Fowre barons of grete honowre. 'Lordyngys,' he seyde, 'take Barrarde nowe And kepe hym, as ye mowe As in yow y affye, &YOGH;ylde hym to me &yogh;erly, And y schall kepe my pylgryme wele, Tyll hyt be day, so haue y hele. Then schall they togedur goo: Men schall see of them twoo, Whether schall haue the vyctorye Thorow helpe of seynt Marye.' \u00b6 They toke Barrarde, \u00fee nobull knyght, And kept hym, as they myght, And the emperowre toke syr Gye And kepyd hym tendurlye. The dewke Barrarde, \u00fee fals gloton, Bethoght hym of a treson. Fowre cosyns, that he hadde, Preuely he them badde, That they schulde to \u00fee courte goo The pylgryme \u00feere for to sloo. They were armed and that anon And came to \u00fee courte euerychon. Forthe they yede full preuelye, Tyll \u00feey came \u00feere, as was syr Gye. Gye lay in a lofte bedde Wyth golde clo\u00feys well yspredde. Hys kepears were faste slepeande, And euery man on \u00fee bedde leyd hande. The bedde they toke vp thare And to the see they hyt bare. But euyr slepyd syr Gye: God of hym haue mercye! They caste the bedde into \u00fee see: But god helpe, drowned had he bee. Hyt was caste wyth a wawe Vp a whyle and downe a thrawe. \u00b6 Gye wakyd at the laste And hys hedde vp he caste. He sawe \u00fee sterres bryght schynande: On no syde sawe he no lande, But brode watur all abowte. Therfore he had grete dowte. 'God,' he seyde, 'all weldande, That stabulde bo\u00fee watur and lande, Who hath done to me \u00feys dede? Lorde, y faght for no mede, For golde nor syluyr, \u00feou doyst knowe, But for my trewe felowe To delyuyr hym of paryle, That hath be in exsyle. Some tyme he was a doghty knyght And now he ys a wrechyd wyght. Ageyne Barrarde y toke the fyght For to haue getyn Tyrrye hys ryght.

And all ys Part of h blotted out before ys. thorowe Barrart: God let hym neuer of blysse haue part.' \u00b6 Wyth that came a fyscher In a bote Gye full nere. What he was, he bad hym say, And whethyr he leuyd on goddys lay. Vp he heuyd hys hedde, Gye, And cryed the fyscher mercye. 'My frende,' he seyde, 'haue no drede: I leue in god, so he me spede. Knowest \u00feou oght of a fyght Betwene a pylgryme and a knyght?' '&YOGH;ysse,' quod the fyscher, 'y sawe hyt, The batell, to the darke nyght. The emperowre parted them late And made to kepe \u00feem, wele y wate.' 'I am,' quod Gye, 'the pylgryme, That faght \u00feen agenste hym. We were partyd &yogh;ystur nyght: We no lenger myght see to fyght. Into a chaumbur was y broght: Of no treson y ne thoght. Ynto a bedde was y done: I was wery and slepyd soone. Now am y here, but y not, howe. My dere frende, helpe me now. For thy trewthe and thy lewte Haue thou some mercy of me.' \u00b6 The fyscher for hym was sorye And toke hym into hys bote hym bye And ledde hym home \u00feat ylke nyght And kepte hym wele wyth all hys myght. \u00b6 The emperowre rose well &yogh;erlye And masse he harde in grete hye. Sythen he came into hys halle And wyth hym hys barons all. He bad brynge to hym Barrardyne And afturwarde hys pylgryme. Fowre barons forthe dud wende And broght \u00fee dewke, as men hende. To the emperowre they dud say, That the pylgryme was away: Bothe was awey he and hys bedde. The knyghtys, \u00feat stale hym, were fledde. Corrupt. Cf. the Caius MS. p. 230: And hys wardeyns were all fled. Ther wyste no man, where he was done. The emperowre was wrothe sone And sware be god and seynt Marye, That they schulde be hangyd hye, That had betrayed hys pylgryme And hys wardens, be seynt Martyne. Tho he spake wyth grete yre To the dewke, that stowte syre. 'Dewke,' he seyde, 'wythowte stryfe, Brynge hym forthe vpon \u00fey lyfe, That \u00feou haste takyn in \u00fey kepeyng, Or y schall juge the for to hynge. Dede or quyck brynge hym to me: Thou haste hym slayne, wele y see.' \u00b6 Barrarde starte vp, wythowten dowte, As man, \u00feat was bo\u00fee styffe and stowte. 'Syr,' he seyde, 'now fynde y wele, That men me tolde euery dele. I haue serued yow, as ye knowe, And kept yowre lande to yowre prowe: Wolde ye now thus juge me? Ye schall not so, so mote y the. Yf here be any man so hardye, That dar hyt proue and byde \u00feerby, I schall hym wyth my swyrde so smyte, That hys hedde schall of tyte.

I schall dystroye the euery dele And all thy londe, so haue y hele.' \u00b6 The emperowre harde \u00feys wele And knewe hys maners euery dele. He beganne to waxe wrothe And often sware then hys othe, Yf he went, he schulde be slane, MS. slayne. And he myght hym fynde or tane. \u00b6 Then came forthe the fyschere And sayde to the emperere: 'Syr, y prey yow pur charyte, Here me, yf yowre wylle bee. Of that pylgryme y can sey Where he ys, be thys day.' 'My frende,' seyde the emperowre, 'Saye me, so god geue \u00fee honowre. Thou schalt haue, be he not dedde, An hundurd besawntes of golde redde.' \u00b6 Tho seyde \u00fee fyscher: 'herkyn me trewlye; For, syr, y wyll not to yow lye. To nyght late was y gone On \u00fee see to fysche allone. I fonde a lofte bedde fletynge And therin a knyght lygynge. Y askyd hym, what he was, And he me tolde in that case, That he was that pylgryme, That faght wyth dewke Barrardyne. Y leyde hym in my bote wythynne And ladde hym home to myn ynne And haue kepyd hym \u00feys nyght. Sende aftur hym anon ryght.' 'My frende,' seyde the emperowre, 'Thou schalt haue grete honowre.' \u00b6 Aftur \u00fee pylgryme sone he sente, And he came at hys comawndement. Hastelye, wythowten fayle, They were do to batayle. \u00b6 Now togedur can they goo: They dalte strokys many tho And wyth \u00feer swyrdys \u00feere of stele They smetyn togedur wele. Hyt was wonder for to see: A stronger fyght myght none bee. They faght tyll vnderne of \u00fee day: 'Thys ys grete wonder,' they can say. \u00b6 The dewke was full of felonye And smote Gye wyth envye And repulde hys face and hys chynne And of hys cheke all the skynne. Downe e in Downe illegible in consequence of an ink-blot. be \u00fee schoulder \u00fee stroke dud glyde: Hyt brake many a mayle vnryde. Of \u00fee schelde brake a quartere, Os he wolde MS. schulde.

Gye felle also skete Bothe on hondys and on fete. \u00b6 Gye starte vp, as sparke of fyre, And smote Barrarde wyth grete yre. He smote hym on \u00fee helme so there, That awey flewe a quartere And of hys odur helme MS. schelde.

All the men, that stode besyde, Had wonder of that stroke vnryde And seyde, no man in &yogh;erthe lyueande Myght smyte soche a stroke wyth hande. \u00b6 On the &yogh;orthe Gye set hym downe And seyde: 'Barrarde, false felowne, Nowe art thou here forlorne. A lack, that euer \u00feou was borne! A boldear knyght was neuer lyueande Nor a doghtyar of hys hande: Yf thou a false traytowr ne were, In all \u00feys worlde had not be \u00fey pere.' All, that euer abowte hym stode, Sayde, he was of sarsyns sarsyns, at least, corrupt.

And y wyste, where he wore, Y schulde delyuyr hym lesse and more.' Gye answeryd: 'yf y may, Ye schall hym see thys ylke day.' 'My frende,' he seyde, 'hastelye Go seke me erle Tyrrye.' \u00b6 He wente all the cyte abowte And soght Tyrrye wythynne and owte. At the laste he dud hym fynde In a churche faste prayinge. 'Ryse vp,' seyde Gye, 'pur charyte, The emperowre hath sende aftur \u00fee.' \u00b6 Vp he helde hys hedde, Tyrrye, And seyde: 'lorde Iesu Cryste, \u00fey mercy! In whome may any man trowe For to telle hys cowncell nowe? Thou semed trewe for to bee And now \u00feou haste bewryed me: To the emperowre \u00feou haste tolde And to Barrarde, that ys so bolde.

Thou schalt now newe tythyngys here: The dewke Barrarde, he ys dedde (Of hys councell y can no redde) Thorow a pylgryme, hardelye, That the defendyd of felonye.' \u00b6 When \u00feey before \u00fee emperowre came, &YOGH;yt had Tyrrye drede of blame. To the emperowre spake Gye: 'Lo, here ys erle Tyrrye.' Tho seyde Tyrrye: 'thus am y: Longe haue y be thus drerye. Y haue be in sorowe stronge: Thys odur halfe yere me \u00feo&yogh;t to longe.

And now here y saye, the pylgryme (Haue he goddys beneson and myn), That hath \u00fee dewke Barrard schent: Y weene, god hym hedur sente.' And tho on kneys felle Tyrrye And seyde: 'emperowre, mercye!' \u00b6 Dewkys, erlys grete plente, That were curtes men and free, Downe \u00feey felle and \u00feat anon: For Tyrrye they preyed euerychon. The teerys fro \u00fee emperowre yede \u00feo. 'Tyrrye, gentyll baron,' seyde he thoo, 'Thou haste had grete trauayle. Gentyll knyght, wythowte fayle, Of thy gode y haue plente: To day wyll y cese the In all \u00fey lande, castell and towre. &YOGH;yt schalt \u00feou haue more honowre: Y make \u00fee steward of my londe. Y hyt the geue vnto thy honde.' All they seyde at oon crye: 'Syr emperowre, gramercye!' The emperowre then kyste Tyrrye After this line 9746 is written, but struck out again. And forgaue hym hys malycolye. Dewkes and erles euerychone Kyste Tyrrye and that anone. \u00b6 The emperowre seyde to Tyrrye: 'Say me now, for \u00fee loue of me, What man ys the pylgryme? Ys he thy brodur or of thy kynne, That faght wyth Barrarde so hardelye To defende the of felonye? I went, ther had be no knyght That wyth Barrarde durste take \u00fee fyght. 'Syr,' seyde Tyrrye, 'as y trowe, And be the feyth, y haue to yow, Thys pylgryme sawe y neuer are, But be \u00fee way, as y dud fare, Nor neuer wyste or now ryght, That for me he had tane \u00fee fyght, And now y wote wyth glad mode: God, that dyed on the rode, &YOGH;elde hym hys mede, wythowte fayle. He hath me delyuyrde of trauayle.' \u00b6 The emperowre full curteslye Into a chaumbur ladde Tyrrye And clo\u00feed hym in a ryche mantell Lynydde wyth gode sendell And gaue hym stedys two or thre, The beste in all that cuntre. He went to Gormoyse hastelye And wyth hym he ladde godde syr Gye. \u00b6 To that cyte came Tyrrye: He was resseyuyd worschypfully. The pylgryme wyth hym he broght: That hyt was Gye, wyste he noght. Hys cowntes soght he thorow \u00fee londe And at the laste he hur fonde, There sche was hydde for grete dowte Of Barrard, \u00fee steward, \u00feat was so stowte. \u00b6 Now ys Tyrrye bolde and wyght And in all \u00feat londe moost of myght. He wolde not forgete in no manere The tresure in the hye rochere, That \u00feey fonde betwene them twoo Be the way, as \u00feey dud goo. Vnto Gormoyse he dud hyt brynge: There was mony a ryche thynge. He gaue hyt vnto syr Gye, But he wolde none, verelye. Of golde nor syluer roght he noght: To serue god was all hys thoght. Tho seyde Gye: 'geue some to pore menys hande And wyth the remlawnt store thy lande.' \u00b6 On a day Gye hym bethoght: Lenger wolde he dwelle noght. He toke hys leue at erle Tyrrye And spake to hym full drerelye: 'Syr, wyth thy leue now wyll y fare. Wyth \u00fee may y dwelle no mare. Y bydde the, yf thy wylle bee, That on the way thou lede me. Soche thynge may \u00feou here say, That \u00feou schalt haue wonder to day. Looke, \u00feat no man come wyth the.' 'Nay,' seyde Tyrrye, 'so mote y the.' Tyrrye lepe on a mewle awmblande And thorow the cyte wente prekande: Ther myght no man wyth hym goo, But hyt were themselfe twoo. \u00b6 When \u00feey were paste but a myle, They set them downe \u00feere a whyle. Tho seyde Gye to Tyrrye: 'herkyn me now. Ye knowe not me, as y trowe. Yf ye vndurstode wele, Ye oght to knowe me some dele. May ye not Gye knowe, That was some tyme yowre felowe, That slewe for yow \u00fee dewke Oton And delyuyrd yow of pryson? Furste y fonde yow woundyd sare Yn the foreste, as y can fare, And slewe for \u00fee theuys fyftene And wanne \u00fey lemman bryght and schene And the fro fowre knyghtys wanne And slewe them euerychane And on MS. ouer.

Thys ys Gye, that thou seyst here: Thou oghtyste to knowe me on all manere.' \u00b6 When Tyrrye sye Gye, hys harte wolde breke: Not a worde myght he speke. To grownde soone felle he than: More sorowe, \u00feen he had, had neuer no man. 'Gye,' he seyde, 'my dere felowe, Wherefore myght y the not knowe? Allas, that euyr y bode thys day! Myn eyen were blynde, so may y say. Y myght haue sene and knowen full ryght, That ye were Gye, \u00feat nobull knyght, Be yowre strenkyth and be yowre myght And be yowre strokys, that were so wyght. Who schulde haue be on lyue so stronge, That durste agenste Barrard stonde so longe, But yf hyt were yow, syr Gye? Therfore of me haue mercye. Y aske yow mercye, Gye, nowe, That y dud mysknowe yow.' \u00b6 Downe he felle to Gyes fete And full sore dud he grete. Hys legges were bare euery dele, That were some tyme clo\u00feed MS. clo\u00fee. But cf. the Caius MS. p. 242, That som tyme were clothed well. well. Therfore he wepyd and wrange hys hande: In thys worlde was none lyueande, That myght them bo\u00fee haue see, But \u00feey wolde haue had pyte. \u00b6 Gye had grete moornynge: He myght not a worde for\u00fee brynge. Gye toke vp erle Tyrrye And kyste hym full tendurlye. But \u00feey had so grete moornynge, They felle bothe in swownynge. Then seyde Gye: 'my felowe dere, Now wyll y wende: \u00feou schalt byde here. I \u00fee beteche god almyght: He \u00fee kepe bothe day and nyght. Y haue a chylde be my wyfe: He wyll be a man, yf he haue lyfe. Yf he haue to the mystere, Helpe hym wyth thy powere.' \u00b6 'My brodur,' seyde Tyrrye than, 'For hym, that thys worlde wan, Dwelle here stylle wyth me And my trowthe y plyght \u00fee, All, \u00feat in \u00fee worlde myn ys, Halfe schall be thyne, so haue y blys, Whyll that y leue maye.

I wyll go: \u00feou schalt byde here. Y the betake to goddys powere.' \u00b6 At \u00feat partynge grete sorow \u00feey made. Togedur \u00feey kyste: \u00feey were not glade. All wepynge they went in twoo And sye ney\u00feer odyr neuer aftur moo. The erle ageyne wente soone anon: Into hys chaumbur he wente whome. Thre dayes my&yogh;t he nodur ete nor drynke: Hyt wolde not in hys body synke. When the cowntas sye thoo, That hyt was Gye, that was agoo, Sche bemoonyd hym swy\u00fee stronge And hur lorde sche blamed amonge And seyde: 'yf ye wyth loue ne holde hym my&yogh;t, Ye schulde wyth strenky\u00fe haue do yowre my&yogh;t.' \u00b6 Now Gye goyth forthe full sorye And ofte he thynky\u00fe of Tyrrye. So longe he went in hys jurnayse Thorowe many vncowthe cuntrayse, Tyll he came to Whytesande And ryued into Ynglande. There he askyd of many a oon, Where he myght fynde kynge Adelston, And \u00feey seyde to hym: 'at Wynchestur, But twenty myle fro Chychestur.

A helme he had bothe gret and stronge: Abowte hys swyre a targe longe. Wyth yron and stele bowndyn hyt was: No nodur metell theron was. Black hyt was and lothelyche, Hys armowre, as hyt were pych.

But Gye on \u00fee helme hym smote Wyth a darte, that came hote; And so faste hyt can dryue, That hyt brake in pecys fyve. Collebrande drewe hys swyrde anon And smote Gye \u00fee helme vpon: Betwene \u00fee body and the arson Felle \u00feat grete stroke adowne And gaue the stede dethys wounde, And downe he felle to the grownde. \u00b6 Gye vp starte then full rathe: Blessyd be god, he had no skathe!

On the schoulder felle the stroke: A grete splente owte hyt smote. The flesche hyt carue, \u00fee blode owt ranne: He, that hyt smote, was a nobull man. \u00b6 Collebrande tho was aschamed, When he sye hys blode so tamedde. Soche a stroke he smote to Gye Hye on hys helme, sekerlye: The flowre felle and \u00fee serkyll also, The schelde he carue also in twoo. Of soche a strokk y haue not harde. Stronglye Gye was aferde. Sythen Gye wyth hys honde Stroke vnto Collebronde And hym smote so, os y yow seye, That \u00feorow \u00fee schelde hyt wente, par faye, That hys swyrde stycked faste. Tho was Gye sore agaste: Hys swyrde brake wyth the vpbrayde, And therwyth was Gye dysmayede. \u00b6 Now the Danes prowde bene And seyde \u00feemselfe \u00feem betwene, That Gye was \u00feen ouercomen And the kynge yschente and ynomen. 'Knyght,' seyde Collebrande, 'Thou haste no wepyn in \u00fey hande.

Then seyde Collebronde full ryght: 'So helpe me Mahownde of myght, Harnes getyst \u00feou none of me: Furste y schall haue the hedde of \u00fee. Thou schalt not fynde me soche a brayton Harnes to take \u00fee into \u00fey bandone.' \u00b6 Or Collebronde hym turne myght, To the axes Gye lepe aryght: An axe there vp he nome And to Collebronde \u00feerwyth he come. When Collebronde that sye, Hastelye forthe he came to Gye. Wyth strenkyth he smote to hym in hye A stroke, that was full myghtye. But Gye soone asyde schete MS. skypte. And ellys he had sore be smete. Into \u00fee &yogh;orthe felle the bronde: Wrothe therfore was Collebronde Gye forgate that nothynge, The axe he w blotted out after he in MS. hente, wythowte lesynge: The arme he smote of of Collebrande Wyth the strenkyth of hys hande. When Collebrande felyd hym smyte, To hys bronde he lepe tyte And take hyt he wolde in hys lefte hande, When of the todur no helpe he fonde. Toward the grownde he lowtud in hye, And Gye yede hym so nye: Hys stalworthe axe well hye he hafe And soche a strock in \u00fee neck he hym gafe, That hys hedd of dud flye. Gye was fayn then, sekurlye. \u00b6 The gloton felle downe to grounde anon: The Danyschmen were sory echon. The kyng Anlafe was well woo And hys odur folke echoon alsoo. To schypwarde they be wendande And anon homewarde \u00feey be saylande. And blythe ys kyng Adelston And hys barons euerychone. There they toke syr Gye And lad hym forthe, sekurlye, To Wynchestur, the ryche towne, Wyth songe and wyth precestion 'Te deum laudamus' syngyng And god almyghty therof thankyng. \u00b6 Gye wyth \u00feat vnarmed hym And sythen askyd hys slauyn. The kyng hym toke be the honde And askyd hym, in what londe He was in borne, and of hys name; For he was a man of grete fame. And bad hym gyftys gode and ryche, Castels enclosed wyth depe dyche. And syr Gye hyt all forsoke, That he of hym ryght noght toke, But thankyd god, Maryes sone, That Collebrande was ouercome. \u00b6 'Mercye, syr,' seyde the kynge, 'For hym, \u00feat schope all thynge And suffurde dethe vpon \u00fee rode All for mankyndeys gode, That \u00feou thy name telle me, Where \u00feou were part of a b blotted out before were. borne and in what cuntre.' And he seyde: 'thou schalt here, When \u00feou me byddyst on soche manere, Wyth that thou do, as y schall say. Brynge me forwarde on my way And \u00feyselfe allone wyth me goo Be&yogh;onde \u00fee towne a myle or twoo, And all \u00fee so\u00fee y schall yow telle, That of oon worde y lye ne wyll.' \u00b6 Forthe of the cyte be they goo, But wel farre yede they not thoo. 'Syr,' quod Gye, 'stynte a throwe. For ye me haue bettur knowe, Y schall yow telle in thys stedde, Sythe ye me haue so often bedde. But, MS.

Syr Harrowde wolde wyth hym haue goon, But he wolde haue neuyr oon.

When y was a yonge squyer, Wyth hym y was in grete power. Yf y dud any skathe Or ony man wyth me were wra\u00fee, I schulde \u00feen haue vpbrayde And for my fadur be myssayde, For y wolde not forthe fare To seke my fadur, where he ware, Yn any londe yf he were slane MS. slayne. Or he were in preson tane. Therof was y repreuyd ay, But y bethoght me on a day, To seke my fadur y wolde fonde: For no\u00feynge wolde y wonde. \u00b6 To Wallyngforde y wente prekande: My fadur armes there y fonde, Hys hawberke and hys gode stede, Hys schylde, hys swyrde and hys o\u00feer wede.
