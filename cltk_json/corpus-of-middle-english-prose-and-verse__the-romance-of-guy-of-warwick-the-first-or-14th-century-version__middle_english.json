That same Stywarde had a sone Wise and curteys at Frome; All men him did loue sothely, Ther was noon that him wolde shonye. To All men yiftes yiue he wolde, Therfore so curteis he was holde. The Erle Rohaud he serued thoo, His kynde Lorde, so mote y goo. The Erle him loued hertly and dere, Ouer all other that with him were. Of his coupe he him serue Didde, And priuyest with him in euery stede: The Erle Rohaud mikel him worshipped, And for his fader loue thoo farther him cleped. Guye of Warrewik his name was, In all the courte n&omacr;&omacr;n more honoured nas: Of knyghtes and of grete lordinges, Of more and lasse, in all thinges. Mikell he was, and of grete mighte, And fairest of all other be sighte: All him behelde wondirly, His fairenesse was so grete truly; So many goodnesses in him were: All him preised that were there. . . . . . . . . . . Guye a foster fader hadde, That him lerned and also redde Of wode, of Ryuer, of all game: Heraude of Arderne was his name. He was curteys, and well taughte, Guye he lerned and forgate him naughte; Mikell he kouthe of haukes and houndes, Of Ostours, of Faukons of grete moundes. All that wolde of him oughte craue, With good wille they shulde it haue. To parsons and to pouer knyghtes Ofte he wolde yiue riche yiftes; And to other ofte yiue he wolde Palfrey or stede, siluer and golde, Euery man after his good dede Of Guye vnderfangeth his mede.", "3": "ON WITSONDAYE called Pentecoste The Erle helde a grete feste In Warrewik, that good Citee, As it euer was wonte to bee. There were Erles, barons, and knyghtes, And many a man of grete myghtes; Ladies and maydens of grete renown, The grettest desired ther' to bee bown. Many a mayde there chese hir loue anone Of knyghtes that thider were come, And the knyghtes also their' lemans there Of the maidens that there were. Whan they fro chirche were come, In to the halle they yode full sone. Whan the Erle to the mete sette was, Guye stode before him in that plaas, He that was Sywardes sone, To whom the Erle grete loue had nome. The Erle cleped to him Guye, To him gan sey and commaunded on highe, That he in to the chambre wente And grete well his doughter that was so gente; And that he shulde at mete that Daie Bee willyng to serue that faire may&emacr;. 'Sir,' seide Guy full freely, 'I doo youre heste full blithely.' With a silken kirtell began him shrede, And in to the Chambre than he yede. The kirtell so well sitting it was, It to amende noo nede it has; Guy was so well shape and gentille, The maidens him behelde with good wille. On knees before Felice he him sette, And on hir fader behalue he hir grette, And seide how he was thider sentte To serue hir to hir talentte. Felice answerd ayene to Guye, 'Beaux amye, moult gramercye.' And than she asked him in that place Where that he borne was. And Guye seide, 'my fader is called Sywarde, That is youre faders Stywarde; Many a daye he hath me with him holde, And forthe me bredde, god him foryelde!' 'Bee ye,' she seide, 'Sywardes sone, That all goodnesse hath in wone?' Guye stode stille and spake noughte. With that the water was forth broughte: She did wesshe and wente to mete anone And so did knyght, squier, and grome. All his mighte he did that daie To serue well that faire maye. Wele to serue he did his myghte Moo than thirty maidens brighte; That all they anamoured were On Guye for his faire chere. And he therof rekked noughte, For vpon another' was his thoughte: On Felice with the nebbe so brighte He kaste his loue with all his mighte; That he ne wiste what to doo, Hir loue werked him suche woo. He wepte with mayne slilye, And mourned in hym self softelye, That he euere shulde see Hir brighte rodye, hir faire blee. Moche wonder he hath ywis, That she so faire a creatur is. He durste not to hir his loue kithe, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Bot to his chambre wente right swithe: Withoute any leue takyng of Felice thoo, . . . . . Oute of his chambre he did goo. . . . . . . . . . . Than asked of him his meyne, Why that he so heuy wolde bee. Guye answerd theim anone, Seying that sikenesse is come him vpon, Wherthurgh his lif he weneth to forgoo, And neuere helth to haue of his woo.", "4": "IN THE COURTE mikel bemened is Guy: For him was many a man sory; For he was wonned to serue theim wele, And to theim yiue many a ieowele. Nowe is Guy in grete tempeste, Sorowe he maketh with the moste; For loue that he had to the maye His sorowe encressed nyghte and daie. Nowe is Guye so euyll bee stadde, Hym self he helde for a man madde. For the sorowe that bim befallen is, Ofte he bemeneth him self y-wis: 'In wicked peyne sey y may, That y ne may beholde hir eyen gray, Hir graye eyen, hir nebbe so shene; For hir my lif is in a wene. To hir y shall telle my thoughte, For whom y am in this sorowe broughte. What so euere come to me good or ylle, I woll it noo lenger concele for to spille. Bot streight to hir woll y goo, And in hir mercy y shall me doo; And if she woll, she may me slee, And hir wille doo with me. Yf I my sorowe hir doo not telle, Allas, wrecche, how shall y duelle? Allas, wrecche, that me is woo! Ine wote what y may doo: For my lordys Doughter she is, And y his norry ywis; Therfor the more beholding to him y bee, And neuere noo-wher his harme to see. If y hir loued and wite might he, And therwith he may take me, Brenne he me wolde, or the hede of smyte, Or highe hange for that dispite, Or all to-hewe with swerdes kene, And y him did suche a tene. Allas, y wrecche! what may y doo? I loue hir that is my foo.' Nowe is Guye in so moche sorowe broughte, That of his lif he rekketh noughte; Nor he woteth what he may doo, For the grete sorowe that cometh him to. He wende, he trende his bodde vpon, As man that is woo bee goon; He ne may sitte, nor he may stonde, Nor vnnethe vnto him drawe his honde, Ne reste take of any slepinge, Nor ete mete, nor drinke drinke; Nor may noo man him comforte, Bot euere is songe is woo with disporte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thus lyueth Guy in grete turmente Till the feest was ouer wente; Afterward he bethoughte is That he doth as the man wyse, That he shall loue bot strengthe haue Him self whan him luste to with-drawe. Than thinketh he, good it is hir to shewe The peynes that for hir greueth me newe: And she of my sorowe knoweth noughte, To ende y wolde my lif were broughte. Bee-tide me yuel either goode, I woll not lyue in this mode; Bot y shall to hir goo, And in hir mercy y shall me doo. Yf that she woll, she may me spille; Bot for all that y ne leue wille.", "5": "GUYE IS to courte come, As man that is in sorowe nome. On knees before Felice he hym didde, And sorowfully seide in that stede, All with quakyng steuene; Thus he seide, and spake full euene: 'Felice the faire, for goddis loue, mercy! On me haue reuthe for our lady, That y ne fynde the my full foo, For loue y you praye, herken me to. Hense forewarde y woll not hele The grete loue, that me doth fele: Shewe y muste the peyne and sorowe That y haue for you euyne and morowe.

Vnder heuen noo thinge is, Were it good or yuel ywis, That y for the doo it [ne] wolde, My lif to lese though y shulde. Ye bee my lif and my deth y-wis: Withoute you loste is all my blis. Well more y loue you than me: Deye y shall for loue of you pardee, Bot thou haue mercy on me, Myself y shall for sorowe slee. Yf ye wiste the heuynesse, The grete peyne, and the sorowfulnesse, That y haue for you nyghte and daye (With true loue y it saye)\u2014 And you it might witterly see, I trowe ye wolde haue mercy on me.' Felice to him answerde thoo, 'Telle me, Guye, if ye bee so The Stywardis sone that highte Sywarde, I holde you for a fole musarde. Nowe thou me haste of loue besoughte, To fole-hardy thou art in thoughte, Or thou me takest for a fole. Thou art taughte of wikked scole, Whiles y am thy lordes Doughter by name; Me thinketh thou doost him mikel shame, Whan thou of loue besechest me, And that y shulde thy lemman bee. Ne fonde y neuere man that so moche mysseide, Nor that so folisshe of loue me preide, Neither knyghte, Erle, ne baron; Bot thou art bot a garson, That art my man, and shuldest bee.

There he made sorowe and sorowe enough: His clothes he rende, his heer he drough. Of loue he bemeneth him strongely, For whom he hath sorowe gretly: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I loue the loue that y ne haue maye.' To a wyndowe Guy yede thoo, For to beholde the castell and the toure also: 'O toure, thou art full faire sette! In the is that maide beshette, That lyueth in ioye and in blisse: Hir loue me woundeth withoute mysse. O toure, why ne were thou ouerethrawe, And vpon the grounde all to-drawe! Than might y my lemman see, That y loue more than me!' He gynneth him bethinke and sore sighe, His sorowe enneweth euere gretly; To grounde he felle, and swowne beganne: More sorowe had neuere manne. The tyme he cursed that he was borne; For loue he hath his witte lorne. 'O loue,' he seide, 'cursed thou bee! So moche mighte is in the. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Suche lif had Guy sikirly All that weke hoolly. For him his fader was well sory, Sabyne his moder bemeneth Guy, The Erle for him sory was, That it liked noon in that place: Litell and moche, all and some, Guy bemeneth at Frome.", "7": "THE ERLE did for leches sende To wite of Guyes euyl an ende.

A-downe he felle swounyng with that; Felice loked vpon him thoo. And behelde his grete woo; Ruthe she had in hir herte Of his sorowe and his smerte. To a maide she seide thoo: 'Take him vp in thyn armes twoo, And ley him vp fro the grounde, Till him bee past that bitter stounde.' . . . . . . . . . . 'By god of heuen,' that maide seide, 'Though y were of the worlde the fairest maide, And the Richest Kyngis Doughter were That in this worlde crowne dooth bere, And he of my loue desirous were, As he is of thine in stronge manere, Ne wolde y him my loue werne, And he me wolde therof lerne. Felice the faire answerd therto: 'Avoide, damesell, why seist thou so? So thou shuld not rede me; Thou art to blame forsothe y telle the. Thou hast ofte herde this speche, That we ne shuld noman beseche, But they shuld beseche women On the fairest manere that they kan, And assaye yf they spede may Either by nyghte or by day.'

Guye answerd anone right thoo: 'Now god wolde it might bee so, That of my deth thou might bee the wite! Therof y shulde bee wonder lighte! I am all redy it to fonge, Bee it with right or with wronge; For suche a drinke me is yiue, That y ne kepe noo lenger lyue; Myn hede y shall fayne for the leye, I rekke not what any man seye.' Felice had of him grete ruthe: 'Guye,' she seide, 'thou louest in truthe; To moche thou art thurgh loue assailled, That thy wittes been gretly dismaied. So moche y shall nowe doo for the That more thou maist not bidde me: Ther nys Lady nor man noon, So wide as me might in this Contree goon, And thou loued hir as thou doost me, But she wolde graunte to loue the.'

Before the Erle tho come Guy, To him he kneled as to his lorde mighti; 'Sir,' quoth Guy, 'armes y aske the, Yf y bee worthy accepte to bee; Yf it bee thy wille that y theim fonge, And serue the lorde withoute wronge.'", "12": "THE ERLE Rohaud answerd thoo, 'Blithely, Guy, sithe thou wolt so.'

It was at the fest of the holy Trinyte, That the Erle dobbed Guy so free, And other twenty for his loue, Good knyghtis [and] barons sones, aboue. Of riche Clothes and sendall Was their dobbyng, thurgh-oute all; Of riche panys of faire grys, And with mantellis riche of pris; Of good armes and stoute stedes, Of all the londe the beste at nedes.

Armes y haue for the fonge, The to see me thoughte longe; Now y am at thy wille come, As to hir that y loue most in wone. Than seide Felice, 'ne haste the nought: Yet hast thou noo thing of armes wroughte. Noo better thou art neuere a dele Than thou were before, y preoue it wele, Bot oonly that thou hast newe dobbyng, And knyght art cleped withoute lesyng. Bot whan y may wite and see That thou hast in tormentis bee, And that thou hast knyghtes nome, Castellis and Toures ouerecome, And thurgh all the londe and Contree Thy knyghthode full good knowen bee, And that it bee for thy myghte, And than thou may aske me loue with righte.", "13": "WHANNE GUY herde Felice so speke, His leue he toke and ganne oute reke; Of Felice he toke his leue anone, And to his Fader he gan gone. 'Sir,' he seide, 'vnderstonde me: I am nowe dobbed as ye may see; Ouer see y woll fare To take lawes and pris there.' Syward his fader answerd his sone, 'God graunte the well ayene to come! Siluer and golde take enowe, As moche as nedeth for thy prowe; At thy wille take with the Hors and harneys and good mayne.' Sywarde clepeth heraude to him, And seide, 'heraude, frende myn, With my sone thou shalt wende In good stede with him to lende. Thou shalt kepe my sone Guy That is yonge knyght and thy nory, For he is bot a yongelyng; I you beteche bothe to heuen King, And the heraude for to kepe; And thy felawes all by hepe, That is Tureld and Vrry, In you y truste sikirly; To-gider with heraude they shull goo, To kepe my sones body fro woo.' 'Sir,' quoth they euerychon, 'Full gladly we woll with him goon.' Knyghtes they were full good, y plighte, Of all the contree the best in fighte.

'Sir,' quoth his hoste, 'ne wote ye nought Of a torment that is bethought?' 'Noo,' quoth Guy, 'by Iesu swete, Therof ne herde y neuere yette.' 'Sir,' quoth his hoste, 'and ye woll duelle, All that y wote y shall you telle: A maide brighte and of grete pris, (Of Almaigne the Emperours Doughter she is) A turnement she hath doo cryde, I herde neuere noon suche on this side; For there nys knyghte in all Spaigne, Anone to the see of Britaigne, That of armes aughtis named bee, Bot there his might men shall see. . . . . . . . . . .

Whan Guy herde this tyding, Well gladde he was withoute lesyng; Than seide Guy to his feere, 'In good tyme come we here. To morowe as sone as it is daye, We woll doo vs on oure weye.' Guy to his hoste a palfrey yaf For the tidingis that he him tolde hath. On the morowe full tymely On their wey thei dresse theim sikirly, Guy and his feres goode Barons all of kynde blode. Of riding doth they neuere stent Till they come to that turnement. Whan thei thider were come And read thei sawe there many a semely man. Bothe by Ryuers and by feldes riding Many knyghtes they sawe comyng And whan thei thider all were come, To ioustes they wente than full sone; Oute of the thrange they gan theim dighte, The Barons all of grete mighte. Than asked sir Guy Of a lorde that stode him by: 'Who is nowe that same Knyght That oute of the rowe dooth him dight?' 'I shall telle the: as y wene, That same with the armes shene A Knyght he is of grete pris, And y the swere by seynt Denys, For to iouste he is dighte, And he may fynde any knyghte That ayenst him darre iousty: Therto he maketh him redy.'", "15": "WHANNE GUYE sawe comyng was Gayer, Redy to iouste he draweth him ner; Oute of the Rowe he dooth him hye, Well he sembled as a knyghte hardye. They smytten than to geders thoo, Full harde strokes they yiuen bothe two. Gaer smote Guy before, Thurghoute the shelde his launce he bore; The launce to-brake, that was so well wrought: The hauberkis were good and failled nought. And Guy to Gaer thoo he smote, That to grounde he felled him fote hote; That hors he taketh by the Reyne And forthe he wendeth with meyne. Tho beganne that turnement: Eche Knyght on other smote good dent; Harde they smyte, y the plighte, Eche to take other they doo their mighte. So many knyghtis Guy toke that daye And thurgh his strength ouerecome that playe, That euery man wondred therof: So many helmes he there all to-drof. That daye satte noman there so faste, Bot that he felled him at the laste. And the Duke Otes of Pauye At Guy he had grete enuye; For pride he wolde with him iousty, And therof hym befelle grete vilanye. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thurgh the shulder Guy him smote, To grounde he felle, god it wote. The Duke Reyner sawe that caas, And therfore he full angry was.

He is my nyghe germayne Cousyn: I am the Duke Reyner that to the speke; I am come him on the to awreke.' 'I graunte,' quoth Guy, 'so mote y thee. Withdrawe the anone and iouste with me.' Guy to him beganne to smyte And did him not spare bot a lite; An highe he smote him in the shelde, That downe he felled him in the feelde. . . . . . . . . . .

Whan the Duke Otes herde this, Ayenst Guy he come, ywis: 'Sir Knyght, telle thou me Of whennes thou art and what thy name bee.' And Guy answerd than boldely, 'I telle the nowe full truely: Guy of Warrewik men clepe me; I was borne in that Contree.' The Duke of Louayne cometh with this And a good spere in his hande, ywis; To Guy he smote with grete hete, And he to him and wolde not lete: With grete dyntes they to-geder dryueth, That their launces all to-slyuereth. They smyte to-geder harde and wele With their swerdes of good steele. They thirle armes and sheldes also: Stronge fighte ther is betwene theim two.", "16": "THANNE Heraude of Ardern forth gan springe, And the Duke he mette in his comynge: Farre of his hors he hath him felled All longestreight in the felde. To the Duke Gaudemer than he smote, And of his hors he felled him fote hote: . . . . . . . . . . Well he dooth as knyght hardy. With that cometh to him vrry.

And on morowe for the same The pris he had of that game. Guy is preised on euery side, And on him is tourned all the pride. And, tho come the thirde daye, That euery man shulde wende his weye, There come the Duke Reyner priking, That good knyght was and well doyng. 'Lordynges,' he seide, 'vnderstonde me, Yf y myssey, that it may amended bee. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Than they cryde as was the lawe That Guy the presente&yogh; shuld haue by sothe sawe. Whan they were all went, Guy to his Inne is come, verament, And did him vnarme lightly; For of the turnement he was wery. With this cometh a sergeant ridyng Slie and wise and wele speking; To Guyes Inne he is come, And to Guy he wente right sone. Curteisly Guy he grette: 'Sir Guy,' he seide, 'god the kepe: Thou art holde the best in this borough And in all this londe thurgh and thorough. Thou hast wonne the turnement, Therfore y bringe to the this present In the Maidens behalue Blanchefloure, My lordes doughter the Emperoure: This white Girfauk, the stede also, Thise white Greyhoundes, that good bee bothe two.

'Grant mercy, sir Guy,' seide he; 'For armes y come not to the, And right to the maide y shall wende And telle hir worde and ende, To Blancheflour, that swete thing, And telle hir of the good tyding.'", "17": "THE YONGE man gooth and Guy lefte there, That is in ioye and not in kare. Two sweynes Guy cleped him to, To theim he seide and bade also, That they with that present&yogh; shuld fonde Assone as they might in-to Englonde And presente therwith in his worde The Erle Rouhaude, his kynde lorde. Whan they herde what Guy theim bade, Full redy thei made theim with hert glade. They wente than in-to Englonde: At Warrewik the Erle there they fonde. The White Girfauk and the stede, The two Greyhoundes that by theim yede, To the Erle they made their present; And that Guy it wanne at the turnement All they haue the Erle telde, And that he was the best in the felde, And that he was moste sette by Of all the knyghtis in Normandy, And that the Emperrour doughter with all than Hadde him chose to hir lemman.", "18": "WHANNE the Erle herde this, Full gladde he was therof, ywis, That Guy so moche preised was. His fader thanked god of that cas: Felice the faire did also, Whan the tidinges were tolde hir to. All his frendes olde and yinge Were full gladde of that tidinge. Tho wente Guy in-to farrer londe Turnementis and ioustes for to fonde. In Almaigne and in Lombardie, In Fraunce and in Normandie. Ther was noo turnement, ywis, Bot he was therat and had the pris.

'Mikel thanke,' quoth Guy tho; 'For sothe so may it not goo.' His leeue he toke withoute more; The erle it forthoughte full sore.

Guy answerd with that speche, 'Fader, god y you beteche, And my moder y doo also; For hastely y woll goo.' Guy gooth forth and theim lefte there, That for him in grete sorowe were. To the see he is come, Good wynde he hath nome. Come he is in-to Normandye, Knyghthode he secheth full hastily. Fro thense he wente him in-to Ispaigne And so fro thense in-to Almaigne. At euery turnement Guy hath bee, And moche preised ouere all is he. Fro thense to lombardie he is wente: Ther were ioustes and turnemente, There they did him preise myche, The lombardes him loued in-liche; For he was curteys, large and free, And of moche might and grete bountee.", "25": "NOWE OF a straunge case y shall you telle, Ye that woll a while duelle, That Guy befell comyng fro a turnement That was withoute Boneuent: In the body he wounded was: Sore it him greued, noo wonder nas. That aspied well the Duke Otoun, That was vntruste and feloun, That he wolde bee a-wreke that daie On Guy of Warrewik, if he maye; For he him wounded at a tournement, As y before tolde verraiment; Therfor Guy was yet was struck out after yet . him lothe, And full depe he swore his othe That he wolde on him wroken bee Or he wente oute of that contree. Whanne Duke Otes wiste that caas, That Guy so sore wounded was, Than the Erle Lambard he clepid him to, That good knyght was, and bade him goo With .xv. knyghtes stalworthe, That euerich was his armes worthe. In a priue stede he did him hyde, Ther Guye of Warrewik shuld come ride. 'Lordinges,' seide the Duke Otoun, 'Vnderstonde, sires, to my Reesoun: My men ye bee all to me swore, Holde ye shull with me therfore. Myn heste doo ye shall, That y to you now telle woll. Me to awreke ye shull goo On a traytour that is my foo, That is come in-to my londe (Werre he me thinketh to werke with honde), Guy of Warrewik that wounded is With a swerde thurgh the body ywis. On the halidome ye shull swere That in the forest that is full neere, There ye shull you all huyde: As Guy of Warrewik shall come ride, His body on lyue ye shall me bringe, Slee his felawes olde and yinge. I shall him doo in my prison; Ne shall he neuere come to Raumpson. With sorowe and woo he shall ende: Ne shall he neuere thense wende.' 'Sir,' quoth they, 'we woll goo, All thy commaundement for to doo.' They doo theim arme swithe wele Bothe in yren and in stele. To their place they wende snelle, And houed there softe and stille, As Guy of Warrewik shuld come Not knowyng of that wicked treason, Ne of the sorowe neuere the moo, That him was comyng to; For all his felawes that good were, Euerychoon he loste than there, And his owne lif had forlore, Ne were goddis helpe before, Thurgh the traitours that were his foon, That kepte him for to slee anoon. Now cometh Guy softe riding Vpon a litell mule ambling. His wounde greued him full sore, And euere the lenger smerted the more. In pees he wened for to wende, As the traitours were redy him to shende. The helmes they sawe brighte shyne, And anone after befelle theim pyne.", "26": "'ALLAS,' QUOTH Guy, 'y am nome! All we been dede thurgh treasoune.' Guy of that Mule alighte, And on his stede lepte, and gan his armes righte, And seide to his felawes all: 'Full deere oure liffis we selle shall. Oure deth is here as nowe, y speke, Bot we manly vs awreke. Eche helpe him self, nowe it thus is, And y shall doo what y may ywis: As dere as y may, y wolle To the traitours lombardes my lif selle.' Than seide heraude thoo: 'For goddis loue hense thou goo. For thy loue we woll dye, Or defende this passage trulye.' . . . . . . . . . . Than Guy answerd anone right, As a good knyght of mikell might: 'Yf ye deye, y shall also; I woll neuere fro you goo.'", "27": "WITH THAT come a Lombard ride, As a man of grete pride. 'Guy,' quoth he, 'yelde the anone, Or ye bee dede euerychone. To the Duke Otes y haue the plighte, Thy body to bringe him anone righte.' The Lombard was hote withoute lette, And Guy him hath with harme grette; He ne spared for noo drede, That deed he felled him in the mede. 'By the trouth,' quoth Guy, 'that y shall my lemman yelde, Thou shalt not thy trouth to the Duke holde.' To another lombarde he smote anone, That thurgh the body his swerde gan goone: 'Nor thou, traitour, thou ne shall me lede To thy Duke that is so full of quede, Nor to his prisoun for the bee broughte.' Heraude smote to another and spared noughte, That thurgh the swerde glode: Deed he felled him withoute bode. Than come Toraude, a good knyghte: Swithe good he was in fighte. With a lombarde he so mette, And so well he his stroke besette, That the heed fro the body fleighe: He smote his shuldres alowe so neighe. With that come Vrry priking (A better knyght might noman fynde), To a lombarde he smote so, That thurgh the body his swerde gan goo: So he smote him, the sothe to sey, That deed he felled him in the wey; And than he seide: 'thou ne Otoun Ne shall vs bringe in-to your prison.' There might men see fighte begynne, Hedes clouen downe to the chynne. All that Guy with his swerde toke, Sone anone his lif forsoke. Some he smote vpon the hode, That at the girdelstede the swerde abode; Some he smote thurgh the side, That they ne might neuere more goo nor ryde. Was there noon that might stonde The dynte that come oute of his honde. So mighti strokes ther were yiue, That the stronge shaftes all to-dryue. There was noon in that stede Bot of his lif he was adredde. With that come ride the Erle Lambard, A sterne knyght and a Lombard; Vrry he hath sleyne there, That forthoughte Guy whan he therof was ware: With the Erle lambard he did iousty, To awreke the deth of good Vrry. With suche an hete he smote him to, That all his armes auailled him not a sloo; Thurgh his herte the launce he bare, And adown he felled him dede there. With that cometh forth hugon, He was the Dukes Nieue Otoun: Knyght he was of grete mighte, Swithe hardy and good in fighte. Toraude there he hath felled, And to deth stiked him thurgh his sheelde. And whan heraude saw that cas, That Toraulde so foule sleyne was, For his deth he was sorye: Him to awreke he doth him hye. Neuere so sory he was, Toward hugon he made a chas. . . . . . . . . . . Thurgh the body he him smote With so grete strength, god it wote, That there before the Lombardes all Of his hors he did him dede fall. Whan Danz Gauter that sighe (A knyght he was of herte highe), Ouere thwert MS. thewert . he smote to Heraude so That all his hauberk he rende thoo; Thurgh heraudes body the swerde yede, All they wende he had bee dede. Whan Guy sawe heraude felde, To-hewe his hauberk and his shelde (And of his hors felled he was As a dede man vpon the gras), And sawe the blode that ranne him fro, Wonder he thoughte, and seide thoo: 'Thou lordyng, to the y seye, His deth thou shalt full dere abeye! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . And by him that made sone and mone, Thou shalt wite swithe sone That thou shalt it forgete nought That thou him hast to deth brought.' Guy with spores smote his stede, As a man that had grete nede. . . . . . . . . . . Than with all his mighte he smote him to, Full euen he karffe his herte in two. . . . . . . . . . . And ther in grene he felled him downe, And bade him Cristes malesoune, For that he did heraude slee, And lete him on lyue bee.", "28": "NOWE IS Guy full harde befalle, Loste he hath his felawes alle; So sory he is, he ne wote what to doo, And he ne? woteth to whom he may bemene hym to. Bot three of the Lombardes on lyue ther were, That vpon Guy thoughte grete deere. Tweyn of theim were hoole and sounde, The thridde thurgh the body had a wounde. Guy with his swerde that oon raughte, That his hede fleighe of with a draughte. With that come priking Dan Guychard, He was a full proude Lombarde. 'Guy,' he seide, 'yelde the to me! Thou seest it woll noon other bee. All thy men fro the been refte: Sauf thy self is noon lefte, And thyn helme is all to-hewe, Thyn hauberk to-tore that was newe; Wounded thou art, well y see, That longe thou maist not alyue bee. This daie y shall the bringe to Duke Otoun, And he the shall doo in his prisoun.' Than seide Guy, 'Guychard, y nelle Yelde me to Otes by my wille, While y haue my swerde grounde And my body stiffe to sitte astounde.' Guychard smote Guy with grete mighte Vpon his helme that shone brighte, That a quarter awey fleighe; The knyght was stronge, hardy, and sleighe. Vpon the shoulder the swerde glode, Of the hauberk he toke an handbrode; God saued Guy that he was not dede, Ne for that stroke had noo quede. To Guychard he fondeth to smyte, And his swerde woll aughte byte. . . . . . . . . . . To him he striketh swithe smerte Thurgh the body well nyghe the herte: That good swerde in he thurste, Guychard to abide noo lenger had luste, Bot tourned his hors and gan to flee, And Guy after him faste rode he. Good was that hors that Guychard rode on, Guy wente ayene and lete him goon: For that he ne might him ouere-take, Full grete sorowe Guy gan make.", "29": "GUYCHARD fleying toke his wey Toward Pauy, as swithe as he may. The Duke Otes fro huntyng come, And with him Barons and knyghtis many oone. A knyght he sawe come priking With armes rende, his woundes bledyng. The Duke Otes duelled athrowe, Tyll Guychard he might knowe: Him thoughte he semed a man aferde, Or that harde tidynges had herde. With that is Guychard to theim come; The Duke him asked full sone, 'Sey, Guychard, who hath wrathed the? Where hast thou in bataille bee? Where is Guy? is he nome? Quykke or dede lete him to me come.' 'I shall you telle sikirly As moche as y wote of Guy: At a Forde we him mette, And strongly we him besette, And his body ne toke we nought: All we been to deth brought; Bot y am eskaped as ye may see.' 'My Nieueu hugon, where is he?' Quoth the Duke Otes, 'telle thou me.' 'In the playne he lieth sleyn pardee.' 'And the Erle Lambard, the good knyght?' 'Deed he lieth in that fighte.'", "30": "WHANNE the Duke Otes herde that, Full sory he was for that myshap, For his folke were so sleyne, And thurgh Guy broughte fro lif to peyne.

'Heremyte,' quoth Guy, 'come with me, And this hors of pris y yiue to the. Twoo bodies thou shalt in erthe graue, That in this forest their dethes haue.' 'Blithely, sir,' seide than he; 'Wende forthe, y shall folowe the.' Than the bodies him shewed Guy Of Toraulde and and added over the line. of good Vrry.

Heraudes body with him he dooth bere Forto burye it ellis-where. He wente him to an Abbey That was ther beside the highe wey. The Abbot Guy there he mette, And full pitously he him grette: 'Sir Abbot,' he seide, 'god the blisse That man made for his owne, ywis: All for loue of the Trynyte I the beseche, for sainte Charite, That thou this body here, loo, In a faire buriel thou hit doo.

To Guy answerd the Abbot tho: 'All thy wille, sir, shalbee doo.' Nowe gooth Guy sore dismaide, His woundes haue him sore affraide. To an heremyte he is goo, That he was acqueynted with or thoo; His woundes hele there he dedde Withoute noyse in that stede; For moche he dredde the Duke Otoun, Full of hatrede and of treasoun.", "33": "NOWE THE Abbot of wom y you telle, Of heraude hath grete reuthe with-all; He lete bere his bodye In-to a Chambre to vnarme lightly; And whan they had vnarmed him A monke behelde euery lymme.

By the woundes he sawe ywis That he to deth ne wounded is, And that [he] him hele might; And so he dooth sothely aplight. In the meane tyme, ye may me leue, Guy was heled and toke his leue Of the good heremyte and wente his wey Toward Poyle right as he may. To the king of Poyle he was welcome, And that he knewe full sone. Of siluer he bade him and of golde, And Guy therof nought take wolde. At euery place in turnement Guy had the pris verament.

Therfor men loued him swithe, And vnderfange him full blithe; With all good men he was leef and dere, And therwith-all their pleyfere. At the king he toke his leeue thoo; In-to Cessoigne he is goo. He is come to the Duke Reyner, That him loued and had full deer; And he him fange full worshipfully, And did him honour full manly. So longe in the Contree ther his duelling is, That ouere all other he bereth the pris.

'Sir,' he seide, 'fro Lombardie.' 'What tydingis there?' quoth sir Guye. 'By god,' quoth heraude, 'y kan noone; For many a daie it is goone That y loste my kynde lorde That good knyght was, at a worde. Betraye vs did the Duke Otoun: Haue he cristis malison! Therfor in this wise y shall goo, And bidde for my lorde euere moo.' 'Sey me, pilgrym,' quoth Guy, 'truly, What height that man that thou loued so hertly?' 'Guy of Warrewik was his name: A knyght he was withoute blame.' With that he gan sighe sore: He wepte and seide 'allas' euermore; He might it noo lenger kepe in holde.

'Heraude of Ardern men clepe me In contrees there as y haue bee. .V. yere y haue thus goo Seching my lorde Guy that y loued so.'

'Certes,' quoth heraude, 'sir, nay: Dede he was goon many a day.' And he answerd, 'y am Guy.' 'A, sir,' quoth heraude, 'mercy.' As sone as heraude vnderstode That he was Guy, the knyght goode, In swowe he felle adowne anone, And Guy in his armes him toke full sone. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

And than heraude he him teelde How his woundes were heled, And thurgh how many londes he had goo Seching his lorde Guy with sorowe and woo.", "35": "THEIR HORS they toke after this, And rode to the next Citee ywis; There did Guy Heraude in herbes bathy, And with good metes him comforte hertly. Fro thens they wente to the Duke Mylone, To whom they bothe were welcome. Of their auentures they tolde there, And thanked good in many maner.

To a wyndowe is Guy goo, Into the strete he behelde thoo; A palmer he sawe comyng, Easely by the wey goyng. To him than cleped Guy, And curteisly he gan him asky, 'Woll thou herburgh? for it is nyghte; For fa[r]t[h]er thou ne goo myghte.' The palmer answerd to Guy, 'Sir,' quoth he, 'grauntmercy.' To sitte downe Guy gaue him leeue, Farther he ne might, it was nyghe eeue.

And as they seide so haue they doon, And doo theim assaille right anoon. Heraude him gooth first to assaily, That fighte for to meyntayny.

With that cometh his folke priking, That their lorde reskewe there, And heraude to take they angry were: Bot heraude vpon him werred strongly. With that cometh his folke hastely: With strength they bee forthe goo, And heraude they broughte on hors thoo. Than gan they to-geder smyte: Noon spared other bot a lite. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The duke Otes had sorowe gretly, Whan he sawe his folke sleyn so greuously, And seide to his felawes thoo: 'Lordinges, what shall we nowe doo? See ye not here a man, by name, That me dooth harme and moche shame, That hath nyghe sleyne all my men, Youre frendes and your kynnesmen? Bot ye on him some wreke doo, I shall you neuere loue moo.' With that they assembled echoon, And to heraude they smyte anoon. There is heraude mysse bee-falle: Loste he hath his men alle, And recouere he shall sone this; For grete socour him cometh ywis. Heraude they dryue strongely, And he werred on him hardily. Whan Guy sawe heraude comyng, Oute of that stronge fighte fleyng, His helme to-dasshed in stedes moo, His sheelde to-hewen all-moste in twoo (And his hors wounded sawe he: In stronge fighte he had bee): With loude steuene than he yede To the Duke and made assaute full quede. He rescowed heraude in the felde, And the other they toke and helde. Whan Otes sawe sir Guyon Come rennyng to him as a lyoun, With highe voice he gan vpbreide, And to the Duke Otes thus he seide: 'Thou false and disceyuable traitour, Full litell thou thoughte on thyn honour, Whanne thow bee-traidest me, And dud my men with sorowe slee In the forest of playnes, as y forthe come With my felawes, good knyghtes echoone.

Two hundred knyghtes assailled Guy, And him wolde haue sleyn wilfully, And he him defended as a man: All that he smote woo theim beecam. There they haue their lorde redde, And all wounded oute of the place ledde. Guy the Almaignes before him wreketh: Many he taketh, and many he sleeth. Guy theim driueth, and fast they flee, As folke that greuously ouerecome bee.", "40": "WITH THAT come the Duke Reyner, And the Constable sir Gaudemer: In a slade they metten Guy, And strongly on him sette they; And Guy him drowe toward the Roume, And all his felawes that with him come; For ther were a thousand knyghtes With theim to mete anone Rightes. 'Lordinges,' quoth Guy, 'herken to me: Thise knyghtis bee comyng as ye may see, The Duke Reyner of Cessoigne And the Duke Gaudemer of Coloigne. In euery side we bee-sette bee, So that we may not hense flee; And though we might y nelle; For forsothe, y shall you telle, Better it is to dye manly Than to flee with shame and vilanye.' All they answerd in that stede, 'With the we woll abide veraily in dede.' To-gider they smyte than faste: Of the Almaignes they were not agaste. There they beganne all newe fighte, Wher-thurgh deide many a good knighte. Guy gooth to smyte Duke Reyner, And of his stede he felled him ther. Heraude smote to Gaudemer there, And oute of his sadell he did him bere. With that cometh forth Gilmyn: Besibbe he was the Duke Segwyn. Than duke Botolf he smote so, That of his hors he felled him tho. Whan that sawe Duke Reyner And the Constable Gaudemer, Before theim their folke sleyne, With grete sorowe and with peyne Their voices lowde they greyde, And assembled ayene with their ayde. With that come the Duke Reyner, And Gilemyn he mette ther, So that the swerde longe and brode Thurgh-oute his hepe it glode. Gilemyn with-drowe abacke fleyng, Ayene-warde faste priking, And is to Duke Segwyn come: Well he him knewe right sone. 'Sir Duke,' quoth Gilemyn, Thou abidest to longe, by seynt Martyn. Socour thy folke, and that blyue: The Almaignes begynne fast on vs dryue.' Whan the Duke of Gilemyn this herde, And of his folke how it ferde, He smote his stede and gan to goon, To his men he seide anoon: Barons, knyghtis, strengthe you Guy wele to socour now; For and Guy bee dede or nome, All we bee thanne ouercome.' With that come the Duke dryuyng, And the Almaignes fast assailling. The Duke a knyghte smote anone, That dede he did him to grounde goon. Guy they socour well with all: Many a good knyght he did dede down fall. On either side they foughte wele With their launces and swerdes of stele: They smote of hedes, armes, and honde; All to-hewen they lye in the sonde. With that cometh Duke Reyner, Sleyne he hath the good Gayer: In fraunce he was borne, Guyes feere; To Guy he was leef and dere. Whan Guy that sawe he was sory: To the Duke he smote greuously, That of his stede he felled him downe; And than he drowe his swerde browne. Suche a stroke he smote him vpon That dey he wende forth-with anoon. Sone there beganne a straunge shoure: To-geder they smyte knyghtis of valoure. So many strokes yiuen thou might see Of the knightis that smote so free: Bothe with spere and with swerde They yiue many strokes and harde. Ther men might see straye many a stede, And many a knyght shriche and grede. Wherto shuld y make a tale of nought? The Almaignes were to deth brought.", "41": "NOWE BEEN the Almaignes ouere-come, To dethe wounded, and greuously nome. Toward their hooste they goo fleyng, The Duke and Guy after theim dryuyng. With that come priking Terry full sone, Of Gornoyse Aubries owne sone, Of With ? thirty Knyghtis swithe and snelle Of his owne meyne hardy and felle: All they come armed the hooste fro, The Almaignes socour for to doo.

Ayene they tourned anone righte, And begonne there a grete fighte. Terry beganne a knyghte to smyte, Semblant of loue he made a luyte. Hertely to him smote Gyoun; His shelde auailled him not a botoun. . . . . . . . . . .

Whan the Duke Segwyn sawe this, Full wrothe he was ywis, And all wrothely seide to Guy, 'This is grete scorne sikirly, Whan all him self oon knyghte Shall vs doo this grete vnrighte.' Guy answerd, 'tourne ayene, And hardily assaille theim; For better it is manly dede bee Than with shame awey to flee.' The Almaignes they goo to assailly, And with grete strength ouerecome bee they. Tirry to theim was euere meuyng, And with his swerde gretly harmyng. Now goo the Almaignes fast fleyng, And in their fistes their swerdes bering.

He wolde speke with no wyght Ne with herawde, the trew knyght; But forth he wente to the see: At jerusalem feyne wold he bee, And in other holy lande, Ther holy men were lyuande.", "88": "IN the courte felice belefte there. Her sorrow was euer more and more. 'Lord,' she seyd, 'what may I seye? How shall I leve thys ylke daye?' Her whyte handys can she wrynge, And downe she fell in sownynge. Her clothes she rent and her here: Was neuer woman that fared so ere. On her hand she brake the rynge: She was a well sory thynge. At the nayles the blode braste owt. Thys lyfe she had the nyght thorow-owte. Ofte she seyd, 'alas, alas!' Gret mornyng mad she in that place. Owt she toke a swerd bryght, And sett hyt to her herte Ryght, And thought to shede her herte blode, For she had lorne her lord goode. But than she be-thought her wyselye That she shulde do grete Folye. She had a chyld her with-ynne: To sle that it were grete synne, And she myght not her selfe sloo But she slew her chyld also. And also she thought in her manere, When he wyste her fader dere, Her fader and her fryndys all Shuld in sorrow and in synne fall; For they wold sey sir Gyoun Had her slayne or he wente owte of towne. There-fore it had be grete folye Yf she had sleyne her selfe in hye. Of all the nyght had she no reste, No more than had a wylde beste. On the morrow she rose anone, And to her fader gan she gone. 'Fader,' she seyd, 'wyte ye nought? Wykyd tydyngis I haue brought: My lord ys wente oute of this contre. Shall ye neuer here-after hym see. In excile now ys he gone: For sorrow I shall my selfe slone.' With that she fell to the grounde, And swounyd thryes in a lytyll stoun le. He seyd, 'doughter, leve thy mornyng. I may hyt leve for no thynge, That he wold wende in excile, Other to put hym in such peryle. Day and nyght he was full yepe How he myght thy love kepe.' 'Nay,' she seyd, 'so muste I thee, Ye shall hym neuer efte see.' Vp he rose, and dwellyd nought, Thorought the towne he hath hym sought. When they no-where found syr Gye, After hys men he sente in hye, And tolde hem all that sir Gye Was gon, and no man wyste whye. When they wyste that tydynge, All for Gye made mornynge. When sir herrawd herd seye That hys lord was wente aweye, He lefte neuer nyght ne daye, But grete sorrow he made aye. 'Syr,' he seyd, 'what may I seye, Now I haue loren my lord free? I dred that I shall hym neuer see. I red yow sende your messengere Thorought thys lande far and nere. And yf he be not founde here He ys att loreyne with hys fere, Wyth the Erle good terrye, Whom he lovyth specyallye.' A messyngere forth he sente, And all the land thorough he wente; But when he found hym not there Home a-geyne he com full yare, And seyd he had the lond sought, But of sir Gye herde he nowght. Tho thought herraude he wold fonde To seche hym in other londe. He toke two messengerys wyght, Both a squyer and a knyght, And yaue hem treasure gret plente, And bad hem wende be-yonde the see To euery londe and euery towne, To aspye tydyngis of sir Gyoune. Herraud hym selfe forth ys gone, Wede of palmer he toke vpone. The Erle of Warwyke sone he fonde, And by-toke hym all hys londe, And seyd, 'in wede of a palmere I wyll Gye seche fere and nere In euery stede and in euery londe There he hath bene in be-fore-hande.' When the Erle saw herrawd so dyght, 'Thow arte,' he seyd, 'a trew knyght.' Herrawd went forth, the Erle left there. To the see he come full yare: Shyp he founde and passyd in hye. Comyn he ys into normandye, From thense to fraunce and burgoyne, To almayne and to sosayne: Herd he neuer man speke with mouth That owte of Gye tell cought. Than he though[t] hym shente: Into ynglond ys he wente. All that londe was well sory, For he myght not fynde sir Gye: Kyngis, Erlys, and barouns, All made dole for sir Gyouns; For they wende vtterly Neuer to haue seyne hym with ey&yogh;e.", "89": "As we fynde in storye Now speke we of sir Gye. All that yere Gye hath gone Thorowgh-owte landys many on, All hethenesse thorrow and thorrowe Ryght to ierusalem ys borrowe. Full longe wold he not dwell thare, Furthermore wold he fare Thorough all the hethen contree. To Antyoche, the riche Cytee, As he wente in that contrey Halfe the day a grette jorney, Vndyr a bussch ther he fonde A pore pylgryme syttande. He semed well a saryzen. He had gret sorrow and pyne. He semed a man of gret lynage. He had gret eyen and gret visage: Hys hed was white, hys berd was longe. He semyd a bold man and a stronge. He made dole ouer all thynge. Gye had pyte of hys mornynge. He drow hys berd, he brake hys here: In sowne he fell oftyn there, And seyd 'alas' that he was borne: Herd sorrow was hym be-forne. 'Pylgrym,' quod Gye, 'what arte thow? Whi makyste thow such sorrow now? I se full well be thy chere Thou arte agrevyd in som manere. Tell me now, I byd the In the name of the trinite.' 'Good man,' quod the pylgrym, 'Thou hast me bedyn at thys tyme That I shall [tell] wherefore and whye That I am thys drerelye. I wene thow shalt haue gret pyte When I haue told the sothe to the. I was a dowty man of honde, And to me there fyll much lande. I was a man bold and wyght: Erle Ionas some tyme I hyght. I had sonnes full fyftene, And bold men and kene. I wene there was neuer man levande, Syth crystendome was brought in hand, That had so many sonnes wyght: Euerych was a man att all ryght. All they be take fro me a-weye: Alas that euer I sye thys daye! Att a batayle I was stronge; The sarzins dyd grete wronge: To Ierusalem com they were, And dystroyed all that was there: I gaderyd an hoste of meny a towne Owte of the crysten nacion, I com to that bateyle thann: There dyed many a dow&yogh;ty man. I and my sonnes fyftene Mad the sarzins for to flene. In that tyme tokyn we Sevyn amerallys and kyngis thre. I and my sonnes chasyd thorough the lande A kyng that was fast fleande: Hys name was kyng tryamoure, A paynyme he was of gret honoure. To Alysaunder he fled full ryght, There he was kyng of mykyll myght. There we dyd foly stronge, For we chasyd hem to longe. There were redy in a wode Two hundreth kny&yogh;tis goode. Oute of the wod they cam anon, And ouercome euerychone. Meny of hem we woundyd sare: For nothyng wold we spare. Oure good stedys gan they sloo: Tho come to vs full mykell woo. On fote we faught faste than, And slow of hem many a man. Or we wold vs yeld hem to The beste of hem were for-do. We defendyd vs all wey well Tyll oure swerdys brake of stele. When we saw no better socoure We yeld vs to kyng tryamore. We made with hym such comnaunte, And therto we held vp oure hande, That we shuld for grete raunsom Bene delyuerd owt of hys prisoun. To Alysaunder he dyd vs fare, And put vs in hys prison thare: Mete and drynke we had full small, Carefull lyfe we led with-all. Hit is twelfe yere and mare That we haue bene in this care. Hyt be-fell vpon a tyde That the sowdan with mykyll pryd, Lord to the kynge tryamore, Made a feste of gre[t] honore: Thrytty kyngis were there full ryght, The sowdan ys men and to hym Iplyght; Amerallys there were fourty, That were redy vnto hys crye. Thedyr wente the kyng tryamoure, And hys son, sir faboure: He was a yong man and a wyght, And a new-dubbyd knyght. Att the thyrd day of that feeste, That wa[s] so riche and so honeste, When they had etyn, and made hem at ease, And seruyd all thyng to theire please, The sowdan ys sonne a-rose full ryght (Syr sadoyne of percy he hyght): 'Faboure,' he seyd, 'I byd the, Come pley at the chesse with me.' 'Syr,' quod fabour, 'with myn entente I wyll do youre commaundmente.' To fabours sabours MS. yn tho they wente, And after chesse sone they sente. Tho they setten the fyrste assise, They were wroth or they gan Ryse: At a cheke that fabour seyd Sadoyne was wroth, and gan vp-brayd. For he was matyd so sone there, Wyth a Roke he smote hym sore; Vppon the heed he brake the browe: Abowt the shulders the blod gan looks like qan. Rowe. 'Syr sadoyne,' quod faboure, saboure MS. 'Thow hast me do grete dysshonoure When thow hast broken my hede. The grace of Mahoun be me be-revyd, Yf thow ne were mi Lordys sonne, Thow shuldyst abye that thow hast done.' 'Traytoure,' quod sadoyne, 'what seyst thow? Hast thow me manessid here nowe? In Euyll tyme thow it thought: Thyne deth thow hast wrought.' With hys fyste he wold hym smyte, But faboure thought it was dispyte: Vppon hys fete he gan stonde, And toke the cheker in hys honde. He smote sadoyne vndyr the ere: He fell downe and dyed there. When Fabour sye that he was dede, He Fled fast from that stede. He went as faste as he myght renne Home to hys faders Inne, And told hys fader how he had slone Sadoyne, the sowdan ys sonne onne. To be struck out? Kyng tryamoure was adrad sare, And for that dethe he gan to care. Vppon her horse they lepyn in hye (In there hertis they were sorye), Faste fleand to Alexaundre, Or of hem rose ony slaundre. Oute of the londe tho they wente, Or eny wyste that sadoyne was shente. When they come to the Citee, Full sory and carefull tho was hee. When that wyste that fell sowdan, That sadoyne, hys sonne, was slayne, He was sory, that grete syre, And he was full of tene and ire. He beryed hys son Richelye, And thought to avenge hym in hye.", "90": "HE sent to tryamoure the kyng, As to a man aman MS. that he louyd no-thynge, And bad hym com to hym on hye, And defend hym of that felonye, And bryng with hym hys son faboure, That slow hys sonne, that foule treytoure: But he wold do hys commaundement He shuld be slayne and brente, Or ellys such Iugement suffer there As in hys court contrey MS. ordeyned were. The kynge dyght hym full yare, And to the sowdan can he fare, And with hym fabour, the good knyght, Be-fore the sowdan com full ryght. The sowdan askyd hym anone How he had hys sonne slone: Yf he myght hym not defende, Thorough deth hys deth he it MS. shuld amende. Forth he brought a blake sarzine: A fowler thefe dranke neuer wyne. He was blake as any piche, Men saw neuer none suche. Hys breste was brode, his body grete: He was thykker than a nete. Comyn he ys oute of ynde, A feller thefe shuld no man fynde. There be none thre at that londe That durste ageyne that one stonde. He was a fote and a halfe more Than eny man that euer was bore. Yf the kyng durste with hym fyght, And prove on hym with mayne and myght That sir Sadoyne was neuer dede Thorough hym ne thorough hys sonnys rede, Yf he myght hym to deth brynge, He shuld go quyte of all thynge. Syr tryamoure had drede stronge Of that Geaunte gret and longe. Neuer the lesse a-monge hem all there all thre there MS. He forsoke that the sowdan on hym bere, And seyd that sadony was neuer dede Thorough hym ne thorough his sonnus rede; And an hole yere of trewes [was] tane And fourty dayes till it be gane. Suche is the law of that contree, Euer was, and euer shall bee: And yf he durste not with hym fy&yogh;te, He shuld fynde a nother knyght. Home to Alysaundre hys he wente, After hys barons he hath sente, And dyd crye thorough that londe, Yf he eny man fonde That durst that bateyle take in honde, He shuld yeve hym halfe hys londe; But he ne founde no man so wyght That durste with that geaunt fyght. He toke me than owte of prisoun, And askyd me tho than reasoun Yf I knew euer any knyght That durste with the Geaunte fyght. Full riche man he wold hym make, And do me worshyp for hys sake: He shuld haue gold gret plentee And halfe hys land euer more free. I seyd, 'I know none such of name;' For to lye me thought shame. 'In none contre ne in no londe Is none that durste it take in honde But it were Gye, the noble knyght, That all men seyn ys so wyght. Yf I myght hym fynde in eny contre Other herrawd, to fyght for the Thow myghtist be seker, with-owt fayle, For to wynne that bateyle.' When the kyng, that stode me bye, Herd speke of herrawd and of sir Gye, Hys ryght hond he leyd on me, And seyd, 'but I haue helpe of the Shall I neuer of man levande Haue helpe, I vndyrstonde. Yf I myght haue sir Gye, I were seker of the mastrye, Other sir herrawd, the kny&yogh;t herdye: Be-fore all other I desyre sir Gye.' He seyd, 'to englond shalt thow fare, To loke yf he be founden thare. Yf he may not fownden be, Loke sir herrawd com with the: I wyll then delyuer the owt of prison And all thy sonnes with-oute rawmsom, And thow shalte haue for thi seruice, Yf thow wylte be ware and wyse, And to me be both trew and hold, Ten somers chargyd with gold.' Then swere I there in all manere To bene hys trew messyngere; And yf I found of hem none, I shuld com home alone: I shuld be hangyd on a galow tree And my fyftene sonnus with me. Out of that lond went I in hye, A carefull man and a sorye. I went ryght vnto allmayn, And forth to fraunce and to spayne, Syth to pollayne and to Sesayne, To pavy and to burgayne; Sethen I wente to ynglonde, And asked euery man that I fonde; Sethyn to warwyke dyd I me, There he was wonte lord to be: Herd I no man speke with mouth That ought of Gye tell couth, Ne of sir herrawd ne of sir Gye, And therfore a sory man was I. But hys men vppon a daye Seyden that they herd saye That Gye was wente in excile I-passyd a full longe while, And sir herrawde is forth wente To sech Gye with all hys entente. Lenger wold I dwell there nought, In many londis I haue hym sought: Myght I neuer fynde man That owte of Gye tell can. Now I come heder this ilke daye, And reste me here be the weye. Hit is twelmonythis and more Sythen that I fro the kynge gan fare. Now wyll I wende to hym a-geyne: Well I wote I shall be slayne; But for the deth wyll I not flee To yeve answere how it bee, For I haue hym my trowth plyght To com a-geyne to hym full ryght. Well I wote I shall be dede And also my sonnes with-owte rede. Of my selfe yeve I nought, But of my sonnes is all my thought; For they be knyghtis bold and wyght, And well assayd in meny a fyght. Yf they myght leve and old men bee, They myght much helpe crystiante. Now to hym wyll I fare, And take the deth with hem thare.' With that he sowned be-fore sir Gye; Therfor he was full sorye. Gye had sorrow and much care, For he saw Ionas so fare.", "91": "'Leefe pilgrym,' quod sir Gye, 'For thy sonnes thow arte sorye: Gye and herrawd hast thow sowght In meny londys, and foundyst hem nought. Thought thow make doel hit is no ferlye, When thow ne foundyst nother herraud ne Gye: Thorough hem thow hopedist to delyuerd be Of prison and thi chyldre free. I was in myn owen londe Som tyme a doughty man of hande: Now for the love of god all-myght, That he me yeve grace to fyght, For Gye and herrawdys sake That bateyle for the wyll I take, And thorow the grace of hevyn-kyng Thy sonnes of prison shall I bryng.' When Erle Ionas herd sir Gye, That he was so bold and so hardye To do that bateyle yf he myght, And with that grete Geaunte for to fyght, He devysed hym full well, Hede and fote, euery deale. He sye hys body gret and longe, And well I-made to be stronge, Wyth bones grete and bare of flesshe. He semyd a man of wildernesse: Hys berd was longe and thike of here. He lokyd on hym full ofte there. 'Syr,' he seyd, 'for thy reason Haue thow goddys benyson; But thow knowest not that paynym That ys so much and so gryme; For, and yf he lokyd angyrlye Ons on the with hys hye MS. eye, He wold the so a-gaste make, That thow shuldyst the bateyle for-sake.' 'Pylgryme,' quod Gye, 'dred the nowght. God ys myghtfull as I haue thought. Many on hath provyd to do me scathe, And with hys eyen lokyd wrathe, Yet fled I neuer fro hym in bateyle. I tryste on god, he wyll not fayle. Though thow thinke I feble be, He And he MS. ys of so grete poweste, That he may yeve me grace & myght To slee that Geaunte in that fyght.' 'Sir,' quod the pilgrym, 'graunt mercye! He that was borne of that mayd marye Yelde the or thow be dede.' For joye he sowned in that stede. 'My frende,' quod Gye, 'so haue I hele, Go we forth, we shall fare wele.' To Alysaunder they them dyght, To-fore the kyng they com full ryght. When the kyng Erle Ionas sawe, Vnneth he cowth hym knowe. 'Sir Ionas,' quod the kyng than, 'Where is Gye, that noble man, Other herrawd that thow hast sowght? Hast thow Eny of hem brought?' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'I will yow seye: I will not lye, be this daye. I have hem sowght longe and fferre: Herrawd ne Gye found I nether. I was full fer into Englond, And asked all that I fonde. They seid that Gye is in excile wente, Therfor that londe is now nere shente, And sir herrawd hath take his weye To seke Gye both nyght and daye. But I have brow&yogh;t a noble kny&yogh;te, That in armes is bold and wy&yogh;te: For yow he will do this bateyle, With helpe of god he shall not fayle. He shall well defende your ryght, And with that false paynyme fyght.' Quod the kyng to Erle Ionas, 'Loke thow lye not in this case. Yf I be trayed thorought the rede of the, Full hye hangyd shalt thow be, And thi sonnes euery-chone With wikyd deth shall dye anone.' 'I Graunte,' quod Ionas, 'that ye seye: God vs helpe, that beste maye.' The kyng clepyd sir Gyoune, And told hym a gret reasoune. 'Pylgryme,' he seyd, 'what is this name?' Then he seyd, 'Iohn, with-owten blame.' 'Leve frende,' then seyd the kyng, 'Tell yow Read \u00feow? me with-owte lesynge, Where were thow borne & in what londe? Was there no brede ne corne growande?' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'in Englonde Was I borne and moste dwellande: Sethen that I was dubbyd kny&yogh;te, I haue bene in meny fyght.' 'Arte thow Englissh,' quod the kyng, 'I owte to hate the ouer all thinge. Knew thow owte sir Gyoun And herrawd, the bold baroun? They be dow&yogh;ty men of hand, Yf they be in the world levand. I owght to hate Gye with grete Ire: He slowe my fader, the kyng of tyre, And he slow my Eme with his honde, The sowdan, at his mete sittand: I saw hym smyte of his hede, And with my&yogh;t and streng[t]h a-wey hit leede. Awey he prikyd ther-with full faste: All we chasyd hym at the laste. The devyll hym savyd, that he was not slone, But he slow of vs meny one. Lord Mahoun wold he were here! Than wold I make well good chere. Yf that he wold fyght for me, Also for-yeve shuld hyt be.' Gye answeryd full curteslye, 'Syr,' he seyd, 'full well know I Gye And herrawd also; both two I know hem well, so must I goo. Yf ye had herraw[d]e other Gye, Ye were seker of the mastrye.' 'Tell me,' quod [the] king than, 'Whi arte thow so lene a man? An onkynd man hast thow seruyd aye, When thow departidyst so power aweye, Eyther hit is thyn folye, That thow departist secretlye.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'well may fall, But myn Estate know ye not all. For soth, I was in good servyse: My lord me lovyd in all wyse. For hym I had grete honoure Of kyng, prince, and maydens in bowre. But for a lytill hastines All I loste, both more and lesse. Tho went I fro my contree, Tyll it myght after better be. Thus will I walke in this estate, Tyll his wrath be abate. When he and I accordyd be, Then will I wende to my contree.' Now quod the kyng so free, 'Will thow this bateyle take for me? Or ellys I shall Gett another. Tell thow me, my leve brodyr.' Gye seyd, 'therfor com I hedyr, I and Ionas to-geder. With helpe of god in trinite This bateile will I take for the, And sle the paynym with my honde, With that thow graunte me this covenaunde, That Ionas and his sonnes ecchone Shall be delyuerd, and that anone.' The kyng seyd, 'I the graunte. Mahoun me helpe & turmegaunte.' 'Nay,' quod Gye, 'but Mary is sonne, That for vs on the rode was done: He be myn helpe for his mercye; For I the sey well sikerlye That Mahoun hath no poweste Nother to helpe the ne me.' Quod the kyng, 'my frende so dere, I wyll make a covenaunte here. Yf thow myght the Geaunte sloo, And bryng me owt of my woo, Thi god for the love of the Grete honoure shall haue of me. All crysten that I haue taken here Shall be delyuerd with good chere. In all my lond of Alexaundre Men shall not the crysten dere. Ther shall be none in hethenes, Man ne woman, more ne lesse, That ys of crystiante But he here shall delyuerd be; And such a statute shall I make For the and for goddes sake, That all crysten her wey shall wende Thorough-owt this land fayre & hende, And, yf any be so hardye To do them shame other villany, Be he neuer so bold ne stowte, He shall be hanged with-owte dow&yogh;t.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'graunte mercye! This [is] a feyer graunt, sekerlye.'", "92": "The kyng bad he shuld bathed be, 'And yf hym Robes two or thre: All his desire be hym brought; Loke that hym wante nowght.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'hold the styll. Hit is nothing my will Riche Robis for to have: I am now but a pore knave. Mete and drynke geve me my fill, And then haue I all my wyll.' The kyng bad than that he shuld have All that euer he wold crave. The terme ys now come full sone, That the bateyle shuld be done: The kyng was nobley dy&yogh;te And all his baronage stoute and wyght: To the sowdan will they fare. Forth they went, and that full yare. Sir Gye was armed and well dyght As it fell to a worthi kny&yogh;t. On he had a good hawberke: Hit was of a full good werke. In fer lond was hit wrought, And to the kynge for a present brought. When hit com to Ierusalem, Hit shone as the son beame. A theef hit stale with robberye, And brought hit to Alexandrye. The auncetres of kyng tryamoure Kepte hit with a gret tresoure. Hit was take for Read fro? tresorye At that ned to sir Gye. Thritty wynters and well more Was hit not on-folden ore: Hit was so clere and so bryght, All the hall shone of the lyght. He had an helme of oold werke, On euery syd styfe and sterke. Who that on his hed hit bere Shuld not be convicte in were. Hit was Alexaundris the kyng: He hit wan at a fyghtyng. He slow the kyng priamoure therfore, And wanne there much more. He bare a swerd in hys honde: Ectour, the good kny&yogh;t, hyt fonde. Ther-with the grekis many one, Or he lese [hyt], had he slone. He wold have yove for the fyndyng The weyght of gold and of other thyng. He had a ryght noble targe: Hit was grete, stronge, and large. There was no thyng that myght hit dere, Knyfe, ne swerd, ne sharpe spere. When he was dight all thus sir Gye, The paynyms of hym had ferlye. Euerych askyd other what he myght be, Whens he com and fro what contre That for the kyng shuld fyght: Saw they neuer a fayrer knyght.", "93": "The kyng seyd than to the sowdan, 'Heryth me now anon. I am com be-fore yow here To deffend me in all manere Of that wiked felonye That was put on me wikydlye. Thorough this knyght that stondyth here I will prove that youre son dere Thorough his owen pursuet was dede, My sonne defendaunte of that quede.' 'Kyng,' quod the sowdan, 'hast thow [hym] brought, Hit shall sone be don I have thought.' He bad bryng forth that Geaunte, Of ynd a paynym, ameraunte. He was armyd noblye: Euery man of hym had ferlye. His body was gret and swith longe: He semyd to be wondyr stronge. When Gye saw that ilke paynyme, That was so much and so gryme, 'Iesu,' quod sir Gye than, 'Hit is the devyll, it is no man. Who shuld euer hys stroke stonde With-owten deth? noman levand!' Forth they wente to that bateyle Hastily, with-oute fayle, In a feld with-owte the Cyte: Ther was hyt ordeyned to be. When they com there they shuld fyght, They daltyn strokis anone ryght. Tho they smytten to-geder faste, Euer whiles her sperys wold laste; But full sone that ylke tyde They brokyn on pecys hem besyde. Then drew the[y] swerdys of good stele, And fawght to-gedyr nobly wele. Ameraunte hys swerd drew owte: Hyt was well sharpe all abowte. Hyt was Ercules swerd the wyght: He had hyt borne in many fyght, And therwith slayne many a mane. Ameraunte hym selfe hyt wane. Hyt was put in water of hell, Therfor hyt was kene and fell. But god of hevyn thynke on Gye, He shall be ded full hastilye. With wrath sterte forth ameraunte, To Gye he made a gret assawte. Then to-Gedyr gan they fyght, And daltyn strokis anone ryght. Ameraunte smote Gye on the helme ry&yogh;t With hys swerd, that was so bryght: He fellyd the flowres all a-bowte Of hys helme, that was so stoute, That was neuer blemysshed ere In no bateyle where it were. Thorough hys sadyll he smote also Hys good sted evyn in two, And yet fell the stroke down thore To the erth a fote and more. Sir Gye fyll to ground anone; Hys good stede vnder hym was slone. 'Lord,' he seyd, 'god all-my&yogh;te, That madyst both day and nyght, Sheld me from deth to-daye, For well I wot that thow maye. Kepe me, for thi swete grace, That I be not slayne in this place.' Vpon hys feete he sterte full lyght, As he that bold was and wyght. He toke hys swerd with gret envye, And smote Ameraunte tho in hye. Of the helme the stroke glode, And by the horse the stroke rode. The stedys neke he smote in two: The Geaunte fell to the erth tho; But vp he stert with-owte dwellyng: Therof pleyned he no-thyng. He smote to Gye with all hys my&yogh;t, And he hym, as a noble kny&yogh;t. Tho they fowghten ryght faste there: Nother of hem wold other spare. They fowght with so grete Ire: Oute of ther helmis sprange the fyre. They breke hawberkis hawberberkis MS. & shyldys: The pecis flew in-to the fyldys. They fought so faste with her brondys: They corue theire armour with streng[t]h of handys. Be-twene them was bateyle stronge, And hyt lastyd swyth longe. Tho thought Ameraunt the tho MS. knyght That he had be in many a fyght: Vp he lyfte his arme on hye, And thought to smyte sore sir Gye. On the helme he hym smote, The sercle of gold of hys swerd bote. The swerd went down by hys chyne, The good sheld hyt stekyd Inne. Then to Gye he stert well stoute, And with so gret Ire he drow yt oute, That on knees he fellyd sir Gye; But vp he sterte full hastilye. Then was hys herte full of tene: 'Lady,' he seyd, 'hevyn quene, Never, sith I was borne in londe, Knelyd I erste for stroke of hande.' Vp he caught hys swerd good, And smote the Geaunte ther he stode: With all hys streng[t]h & all hys my&yogh;t Vppon the helme he hyt hym Ryght. He fellyd hys sercle sett with stonys, That was Riche for the nonys. The aventaile, that was so thyke, Held no more than a styke. He karve the Flessh, the swerd in yode: Hys face was coueryd all with blode. Hys good hawberke he all to-reefe, The good shyld all to-cleefe. In the shyld the swerd with-stode: Of that stroke sir Gye thought good. As he wold the swerd draw owte, Ameraunte, that was so stoute, On knees and handys he mad hym fall; But vp he sterte forth with-all, As a bold man and a wyght, And hys swerd he hent a-none ryght. He smote full faste to sir Gye, And he to hym, full hardelye. The erthe dynned all abowte Of her strokis herd and stowte. The fyre flye from her helmys bryght: That was a well strong fyght! Men [sayden] that syen that bateyle, So faste eche other gan assayle, That such a fyght was neuer be-forne Of creatures that were of women borne. The sonn was hote, the wedyr was clere, As ye mowe in the story here: The morne after seynt Iohns daye In somers tyd, as I yow seye, This bateyle was ordeyned soo Betwene these noble knyghtis two.", "94": "A Meraunte stode styll ryght As a man that was wery of fyght. For hys blode that was aweye, And for the hete of the daye He was grevyd for thryste so sore, That he muste drynke, or dye ryght thore. 'Abyde,' he seyd, 'thow noble knyght: Founde I neuer none so wyght. Fourty Geauntis haue I slayne: Strenger saw thou neuer nane; Yet ne founde I neuer knyght, Yf that I hyt hym a-ryght, That myght stond me eny whyle, But he was slayne with-in a myle, But thow alone this ilke daye. Tell me, knyght, by the laye, Where were thow borne? in what londe, That thow arte so dowghty man of honde?' 'Lysten,' quod Gye, 'and thow shalte here: I will the tell in fayre manere. I was borne in Englonde, And crystoned with pristis honde. Now am I here for this thynge To defende triamoure the kynge That was wronge on hym leyd, And with false wittenesse seyd.' 'Arte thow Englysshe?' quod ameraunte. 'Lord It wold Termagaunte, That thow were sir Gye, the noble kny&yogh;te, That all men seyen ys so wyght! A glad man shuld I be one: Hys hede were myn a-none.

Yf he were slayne in ony gyse, And eke sir herrawd the wise, Of all that in the world were Ne yave I not an here.' 'Wherfor,' quod Gye, 'arte thow wroth? Dyd they the ony lothe? Hit were gret synne and shame To slee sir Gye with-oute blame.' 'Nay,' he seyd, 'it were no synne, But greate honoure for me to wynne.' Quod ameraunte to hym thanne, 'Here thow me, thow crysten manne! Hit is grete hete, as thow mayste see: For thi goddis love and thi crystiantee, Yeve me, leve, yf hit be thi will, Ons leve to drynke my fill.

'Syr,' quod Gye, 'thow seyst wele. Go drynke I-nough, be seynt myghell.' When he herd that word than He was a full Ioy-full man. He opyned vmber that tyde, And keeled hym on euery syde. He dranke Inowgh at his wyll, And euer stode Gye ther stone styll. When he com sir Gye nere He resoned hym on this manere. 'Sir knyght,' he seyd, 'yeld the now: Thow shalt be dede sone as I trow.

Deffende the now,' quod ameraunte. 'Yes,' quod Gye, 'with-oute defendaunte.' They smyt to-gedyr at the laste With swerdis on her helmis faste.", "95": "Now there begynneth a gret bateyle, Eche gan other faste assayle: Here none wold, for deth to drede, Flee from other owte of that stede. Her strokis were so vnryde, Her armoure brake vnto the hyde. Her helmys breke and her schyldys: The pecis flew in-to the fyldys. The mayles of her good hawberkis Sprongen owte as it were sperkis. They fall on knees full ofte both: Hit semyd well that they were wrothe. Ameraunte with Grete Envye With all hys my&yogh;te he smote sir Gye: The creste of hys helme he hyt so, That he smote yt evyn in two; And a grete pece of hys sheelde He smote a-weye in-to the feelde, And into the erthe a fote and more: All spake therof that were thore. Of that dynte Gye had wondre: Hys armoure smetyn was in sondre, But his Flessch had no scathe: He thankyd god of hevyn rathe. But he was astonyed swyth sare: Therof he had grete care. To hym he had gret Envye, That he ne were a-vengyd hastylye. He smote Ameraunte the knyght, He smote hym in the shild ryght Halfe a fote and som dele more: Therwith the Geauntis flessh he shore. Therwith a-bakwarde drew sir Gye; For he was a-thryst, sykyrly. 'For my love I the praye, Geve me leve to drynke this daye. I am so a-thriste, I may not stonde, Ne hold my swerd vnneth in hande. I pray the now of drynke thi grace, Other I for thryste dye in this place.

'I shall the seye,' quod Gye than, 'So thow tell it to no notherman. My name ys Gye of warwyke: I trow thow wilt me not be-swyke. I fyght for kyng triamoure With-owte any more tresoure.' When ameraunte herd full ryght That he was sir Gye, the noble kny&yogh;t, 'Sir,' he seyd, 'be hevyn kyng, Now haue I my desire in all thyng. Well art thow now fownden here.

Gye stert in-to the water depe: But Iesu cryste hym ther did kepe, Out of the water shall he not wyn: He was nere-hand a-drownyd theryn.", "96": {"0": "Now ys Gye in a stronge case: The water ouer hys gyrdyll was. Hys hed he smote depe down: The water was ouer hys crown. Ameraund smote at hym so wele, That in the water he made hym knele. The water hym closyd all abowte: He held hym in, he myght not oute. When sir Gye had dronke I-nough He thankyd god, and faste he lough. Vp he sterte as kny&yogh;t full stoute: The water ran down hym all abowte. He shoke hys hed, & seyd full ryght: 'I-thankyd be Iesu full of my&yogh;te. In cold water hast thow bathid me, But name had I none for the.' Oute of the water he made a sawte, Anon he smote to Ameraunte. An hard bateyle ther began: They fow&yogh;t with gret hertis than.

The Geaunte had a venu caste, And sir Gye counteryd hym at the laste. The ryght hand was the swerd with-yn: Gye smote hyt of with Ioye and wyn. When the Geaunt was wounded sare, Hys hert was full of Ire and care. Vp he toke his good bronde Full sone in hys lyfte honde: Twenty sawtes he mad to sir Gye In a stounde, and that full hastyly, As he were a wod lyon, But euer he kept him MS. hem . well sir Gyoun. Ameraunt tho at the laste Began for to febyll faste: For he had so fought all this daye, And his blod [was] ny&yogh;e a-weye, His streng[t]h gan faste to slake, And his body gan for to ake. Gye a-perceyved hit full well, And besteryd hym faste, so haue I hele: That other arme he smote in two, That arme and shuldre fell hym froo. When that other arme was lore, 'Alas,' he seyd, 'that euer I was bore;' To Gye rode as an hounde, And bare sir Gye nere to the grounde With hys hed be-fore the herte, That sir Gye all a-bakward sterte. But Gye kept hym well with-all, And mad hym to the erth to fall. Hys aventayle tho from hym he revyd, And then he smote of hys he[v]ede. In hys hond he hit hent, And to kyng tryamoure sone he went. The kyng hit toke sone anone, And sent it to the proud sowdan. When the sowdan hit gan seen He for-yave the kyng all his tene; Therwith he yave hym noble thyng, Gold, siluer, and rich clothyng. 'Erle Ionas,' tho quod the Kynge, 'Good tydyng I will the brynge. Thow hast savyd my lyfe so dere Thorowgh this kny&yogh;t, that stondith now here. By that god on whome I trowe, I will make the lord nowe Of all my land fere and nere: I make the lord and master here.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'Graunte mercy! God yow yeld and seynt marye.' Tho seyd the kyng to Gye so free, 'Sir,' he seyd, 'I prey the to dwell with me: Thou shalte haue of me ryght gret honoure, Meny a good Cite, castell, and towre.

The Erle toke leve of the kyng, And forth they went, with-oute lesyng. With hym he toke sir Gye the wyght, And went to Ierusalem full ryght. The Erle hym be-thought vpon a daye He wold wit yf that he maye From whens he cam that noble kny&yogh;te, 'And what his name ys he sey me aryght.' On the morne he com to sir Gye, And asked hym full prevelye, 'Sir kny&yogh;t,' he seid, 'what is thi name? Tell me, so god shyld the from shame. Thow seydyst that thow hy&yogh;tyst Iohn: Thow hast a nother name, be my crown.

Then seyd Gye, 'thow shalt here, For thow me askyst in feyre manere. Loke thow discouer me neuer more, For gret shame and synne yt wore.

When Ionas herd vtterlye That he was the noble kny&yogh;t sir Gye, He fell on knees be-fore hym in hye: Gye hym toke vp full hastilye. 'A lord,' he seyd, 'Gye, mercye! Why go ye now thus porelye?

Yet had I, for-soth, lever hangid be Than such slaunder ryse on me. I wyll wend forth on my weye, And sech reynebrowne nyght and daye: I wyll leve for no mannus rede Tyll I hym fynde quyke or dede. Yf I dwell here at hame All men shall speke of me shame, And seye that hit were no lesyng That the Duke told the kyng. Edgare,' he seyd, 'dwell thow here, And kepe my lande with thy powere, And my chyld, and my wyfe, And my land with-owte stryfe. For-soth, a good man arte thow on: Trewer found I neuer none.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'for goddys love, mercy! Belevyth at home, and leve youre foly, And I yow swere by the trynyte I wyll wende to fer contre: I ne shall blynne day nor nyght Tyll I have founden that chyld rygh[t]. I was onys sevyn yere In the see A marynere: In crystendome ther ys no londe Tha[t] I ne have be there dwelland. Ye bene old and hore well yare, And ye have ssofferd sorrow and care: Hyt fallyth for yow to leve at hame, And send some other in youre name.' 'Edgare,' he seyd, 'speke no mare. I wyll not leve, but I wyll fare, For all the good in crystyante, But that I will seche reynbrown the free. Thow shalte here dwell, be myne e in myne altered from d. hand, And kepe my good and my lande; For well I wot, when I am gone, Myn Ennemyes wyll come anone, And be-sett the with bateyle: Defende the well, with-owte fayle.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'so god me amende, Yf they come we will vs defende.'", "99": "NOw wendith herrawd from the cite, And toke leve of hys meyne. He hyed hym faste from that contre: A full carefull man was he. A shyp he found and passed yare, And sowght reynbrowne wyd whare: In Denmarke and in Irelonde, In northwey and in scotlonde, In allmayne and in russye, In Sisoyne and in tu[r]kye Euer his lordis son he sought, But, for-soth, he found hym nou&yogh;t. When he myght not founden be In all this ylke straunge contre, To constantyne the noble than wold he. Tho come there a tempeste in the se, And hem chasyd full blyve: At Awferyke they gun aryve. He saw be-sydys hym on the lond A ryght fayer Cite stonde, But, for-soth, the wallis of that town To the erth were brokyn down. 'Lord,' quod than a marynere, 'Moche sorrow we shall get here. We be now faste a-ryvand Into the kyng Argus land. He ys a ryght rich kyng Of gold, syluer, and other thyng.' Quod herrawd, 'who oweth this contre, That ys thus dystroyed, and this Cite?' Then be-spake hym a shipman, 'Sir, I shall tell yow all that I can. Hit is amerallys persane: There is no man so fell to MS. in. flamiordan. He hateth crysten men ychone: Well I wote we shall be slone. Kyng argus hath be-segyd hym here, And dystroyed his land ferre and nere.' With that there cam sarsynnys kene, And toke hem all, for-soth, be-dene, Herrawd and hys company, And browt hem to her lord in hye: He caste hem in his preson all; Mete and drynke they had full small. Tho the Duke Moderyse had vndyrstond That the kny&yogh;t sir herrawd was owt of lond, He gaderyd hys hooste of cornwayle: The steward faste he can assayle; But he hym defendyd day and ny&yogh;t Full well as a noble kny&yogh;t. He waged men of that londe: Full rychely he hem fande, And yave hem gold and rich tresoure, And kept that lond with gret honoure. All that yere owt and owte He defendyd hym well with-owte dowte. He yave the Duke bateyle stronge, And euer he slow hys men a-monge. A thowsand men he slow anone Of the Dukis men echone. The Duke myght sped for no thyng Of hys long besegyng: To corneweyle he wente ageyne, And lefte hys men with shame slayne.", "100": "Speke we now of sir Gyoun, The noble kny&yogh;t, the bold baroun. At all seyntis hath he bene That beth in grece or constantyne. He thought in hys herte thare That to ynglond wold he fare. Fro thens hys wey hath he take, And walkyd thorough fryth and lake: With grete traveyle and grete payne Comyn he is to Allmayne. As he com on a daye Ther as a brod wey leye, A feyre crose he saw stondyng, And ther-vndyr a pore pilgrym syttyng. He mad sorrow in all thyng, And euer he seyd with gret mornyng, 'Alas, my sorrow that ys so stronge, And my lyfe that lastyth longe!' When Gye hym saw he had pyte, And seyd to hym with herte free, 'I requere the here nowe, So god the shyld fro sorrow, That thow me sey with good herte Fro whens thow come, & what thow arte.' And he answeryd, 'leve fere, Yf that I tell the here, I wote well thow woldyst have gret pyte, And I neuer the better be.' Gye answeryd, 'leve sir, naye: Thou my&yogh;t be amendid in som weye. Par aventure I may tell the in faye How thy sorrow shall a-weye; For hyt fallyth well to straunge men Eyther other wysdom to ken.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'the soth I sey the, Hyt were gret Almes to tech me. Trewly, sir, I shall yow tell All my sorrow, how that hyt be-fell. I was a kny&yogh;t of Riche londe, And had castellis & toures in my hande. Of Good me[n] I had plentee: All the land full sore dred me. In crystendome was ther no land That I [ne] was in preysed for dred of hond; For I was both bold and hende, And had many a good freende. Gold and siluer I had plente For me and my meyne: Now have I nought on penye Where-with I may my mete bye. Now am I a pore caytyfe: Hit ys no wonder though I hate my lyfe.' For sorrow myght he speke no more: With hys eyen he wept sore. 'Pylgrym,' quod Gye, 'what is thi name? Whedir wylt thow, & fro wens thow came?' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'lett be thy fare: For goddis love, aske me no mare What I hyght, ne what I am: Certes, to tell the me thynkyth shame. Yf I shuld all my lyfe tell All to long shuld I dwell. Whi askyst me such thynge, When thow my&yogh;t do me no mendyng? I had lever som-what to get Where-with I my&yogh;t bye me mete.' Gye answeryd, 'now tell thow me: For hys love that dyed on tree, Tell me thy name, spare thow nou&yogh;t, And who hath the in such sorrow brought, For god, in whome ys thi creaunce, And as he the sent allegeaunce. Oure mete than will we bye; For I have yet a peny or twaye.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'I will yow seye: I wyll not lye, be thys daye. My name was som-tyme Erle terry: A full riche man was I, And now I am a wrecchyd caytyf; Me for-thynkyth I have my lyfe. In Gornoyse was I bore, And all that lond was to me swore. I had a fellow that hyght gyoun: Sithen that god suffred bitter passioun, Was neuer trewer knyght borne, No better man that rose on morne. We were fellowes and trouth-ply&yogh;te: We lovyd well to-geder day and nyght. So lovyd he me, thorough hys rede Line 9118 is the last but one in p. 205, but has a reference to its right place. That twyes he savyd me fro the dede. Hit be-fell so, that ilke Gye Slow the Duke of Pavye: He hym slow, trewlye, For he had hym don velonye. Amonge hys men euery-chone He hym slow, and hys way was gone. He brought from hym my his MS. leman dere, For whom I goo in this manere. Thys ylke duke had a cosyn, Hys syster son, a well bold hyn. Berrard of pavy ys hys name; God geve hym som worldly shame. He was tho but a esquyer: He had seruyd the Empere[r]. The Emperoure lovyd hym well, And yave hym pavy euery deale. That ilke MS. ilke jlke. berrard tho be-gan For to be a stowte man, And so prowd, and so fell, That no man my&yogh;t with hym dwell. In this world ys none hys pere, Ne non so stronge, ne non so fere; For he ys more dred alone Than a hundryth kny&yogh;tis ychone. Yf MS. But. a man were armyd well Both in Iren and in stele, And he hym hyt in the fylde, But he hyt kept in the shylde, Clenly with hys swerdys dynte Fro the hede, or hyt wold stynte, Hit shuld wade to the Gyrdyll Evyn, And slee hym, by god of hevyn. Thow herdyst neuer speke of kny&yogh;t In thys world that ys so wy&yogh;te. There ys none so stronge borne in this lond, And he hym hyt with hys hond, But he wyll breke hys nek in two At on stroke with-owte moo. Berrard ys so fell a page, And so stowte of hys parage, There ys no kny&yogh;t in all thys lond That ys so bold and wy&yogh;t of hond, Yf they were wroth, the kny&yogh;tis stowte, And hys yen ran abowte, But that he shuld for dred quake, And fle a-wey for hys sake. For he ys so wyght of honde, He ys drad ouer all the londe. Hys steward hym made the emperoure, And yave hym ryght gret honoure; For he ys more dred alone Than hys barounys euery-chone. Yf thow were Duke or erle in lond, But yf thow were to hym bowand, The steward wold sone aryse And dystroy the in all wyse, Other he wold the take sone, And to stronge preson I-done. Yet men dredyth hym well more. Yf a pore man the[r] wore, And he hym lovyd with herte free, He my&yogh;t be man of gret poweste. Were he Duke, Erle, or kny&yogh;t, Were he neuer so riche power MS. a wy&yogh;t, Yf hym had wrothyd prince or kyng, Were he neuer so hye a lordynge, He wold hym bryng to the grownde, And make hym power in a stounde. Hyt be-fell that the emperoure Had a councell in this manere Of dukis, Erlys, and barouns: They com to hym, he made somons. Thedyr I com with gret maine: An C kny&yogh;tis cam with me. When I cam be-fore the Emperoure, Berrard acouped me thore, And seyd Duke Otown thorough my rede, Hys cosyn, was done the Read to? dede. When I hym herd of treason speke, Me thought myn herte wold to-breke. Forth I sterte hardyly, For to defend me of that felonye. I yave my glove be-fore the kyng, With hym to fyght, with-owt lesyng, And a-yen all other men That couth owte seye ageynste me then. The emperoure hit toke full ryght, But I ne wyste when I shuld fyght. In all the courte ne founde I man That durste be my borrow than For dred of the Duke berrarde. Tho hit fell with me so harde: He put me tho at hys wyll In hys depe preson still. He seasod all my land sone, And so he wold my wyfe have done, But she ys hyd in stronge stede, But I not where, so god me spede. When I was in preson thare, Nyght and day I was in care. Thorough me he they MS. wende to wynne Sir Gye with som false Gynne. Were he a-vengid of sir Gyoune Thorowgh falsed and treasoune, Also sone shuld I be dede: For me shuld go no gold so rede. In hys preson was I longe, And suffred paynes ryght stronge. There-in was neuer more lyght Than if were derke myd-nyght. Ete I neuer ther my fill, Spake I neuer ther with man my fyll. My frendys com at the laste, And prayed the Emperoure for me faste, And yave him meny yeftis thoo, And they dyd berrard also, That I myght wend oute of preson Vndyr such a condicion, That I shuld wend and feche Gyoun Thorough euery lond and euery towne. I shall neuer blyn day ne ny&yogh;te Tyll I fynd Gye, the noble knyght, And bryng hym be-fore the Emperoure, For to defend hym of that treytoure, And of that grete owtrage Before all hys baronage, And for to defende hym and me For thyng that we apechyd be. Tho went I forth with care and tene: In many a lande sethen have I bene. Fer have I sowght Gye, my trew fere, In Englond fer and nere. When I come there, I founde hym nought: On sir herrawd was all my thought. Both were they fer owte of londe: That tydyng doth me both shame & shonde. shende MS. Herrawd sowght sowght I MS. nyght and daye Hys lordys son, that was stole a-weye. Sir Gye was in excile wente: Therfor I hold me but shente. Was neuer man, there as I couth Goo, That couth owte tell of hem twoo. Sethen I have sowght Gye the free In many a lande and many a contree, Found I neuer man by the weye That ought of Gye couth me seye. Full well I wote that he ys dede: Therfor full sorow-full ys my reede.' With that he syghed swyth sare As man that was in mykyll care. When Gye saw terry so dyght, That was som-tyme a noble knyght, He lokyd on hym vtterlye; For he hym lovyd trewlye. He saw him pore for the nonys: He had not to hill with hys bonys. Hys leggis were bare and yll be-sene, That were wonde to were scarlet & grene. For sorrow sir Gye fell to grounde, And laye in a sownde a grete stounde. When Terry sye hym so lye, He toke hym vp full hastilye. Quod terry, 'sir, beth of Good herte. This Evyll begynneth yow to smerte. Tell me, yf hit be youre will, How longe ye have fared thus yll.' Quod Gye, 'hit ys not longe agone, Seth this Evyll com me one.' 'For-soth,' quod terry thanne, 'Hit ys grevaunce to ech mane. This day twelmoneth,' quod terry, 'hit was To seche Gye that I can passe. Sethen I restyd neuer on daye There I on the nyght laye, That I have bene euer travellande, What by see, and what by londe. As I me walkyd in my weye Here with-yne this thyrd daye Hit was me told, with-oute fayle, At spire ther shuld be a gret counceyle Be-fore the Emperoure Reynere: All his lordis shuld be thare. Ther ys no lord in that contree But he shall at that counceyle be. Ryght thanne ys my terme tenne MS. daye To come a-geyne, yf that I maye, And bryng Gye in my honde, Yf that he be in world levande; And, yf I myght not fynd hym no-where, I shuld in this his MS. land com neuere nouere MS. ; And, yf I com, I shuld be dede: Ther-for can I no kynnes rede, Whether I wend to take my payne, Or I now turne ageyne.' Gye hym herd thus sorrowand: For sorrow he myght not stonde. 'Lord,' he seyd, 'of myghtis stronge, Whi leve I now thus longe, That I se this noble knyght At this tyme this rewly dyght? Trewer fellaw than and MS. he was won In the wo[r]ld found I none. Hangid be I this ilke daye But I a-venge hym, yf that I maye. Myght I speke with the Duke at my will, That of his dedys ys so yll, But I revyd Read reve? hym hys lyfe Other with spere or with knyfe, And avenge terry, my good fellow, God lett me neuer heven knowe.' Then spake sir Gye to terry, 'Leve sir, be not sorye: Hyt wyll the helpe no-thyng To make sorrow or mornynge. Go we now the corte nerehande, Som tydyng to vndirstonde, That we now the better be.' Quod terry, 'leve sir, Go we.' They toke ther wey towarde the cite: Terry a carefull man was he; Gye ys herte was sore also, As they gan to-geder goo: He myght hym hold no-thyng, When he saw terry, from wepyng. He coverd his face with hys slaveyne, For terry shuld not se hys payne. When they had go myles three Towardys that good Cite, 'Lord,' quod terry, 'what shall I do? Such hevynes ys com me to, But I slepe here a while, I dye, or I have gone a myle.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'lye down here still A good while, and slepe thi fill; And I shall for the love of the At thyne heed here restyn me.' 'Sir,' quod terry, 'Graunte mercye, That yt ys your grete curtesye!'", "101": "Tho lay terry down to grounde, And slepid in Gyes armes a stounde: Full faste tho gan he slepe, And as faste for hym Gye gan wepe. As terry lay there in slepyng, Oute of his mouth wente a thyng As hit were a white Ermyne: Sir Gye be-held it, be seynt martyn. To an hylle hole MS. it wente than: Hit founde an hole, and in hit ran. Hit dwellyd not longe, as I yow saye: Hyt come ageyne the same daye. In at hys mouth gan hit goo, There hit cam be-fore-hand froo. When Gye this wonder all had sene, He had wondre what it myght bene. Terry a-waked a-non thore: Vp he arose, and syghed sore. 'Lord,' he seyd, 'hevyn kyng, That I have met much wonder thyng! Me thought I was to an hyll goon: I founde a roche all of stone. Full hit was of gold rede; Thervpon there lay a dragon dede, And a swerd by hym laye: Ys none better of stele this daye. Also me thou&yogh;t that sir Gye, My dere fellow, was me bye: Myn hede in hys lap laye; Tho was my sorrow all a-weye.' Then seyd Gye, 'my dere frende, Thorough grace of god, that is so hende, Yet shalt thow wyn thorow Gyoun All thi land, castell, and towne. Aryse vp,' quod Gye, 'with-owt lettyng: With the grace of god hevyn kyng Well shall we fare this ylke daye.' Toward spire they tokyn the waye. 'Pylgryme,' quod Gye, 'I red we abyde, And [wende] to thys hyll here-be-syde, There thow thought this treasoure laye. Thorough grace yf we fynd hit maye, Hit may vs helpe in all manere; Therof we have gret mystere.' 'I Graunte,' quod terry, 'be this daye. Go we thedir with-owte delaye.' To the hyll they com in hye, And founden all such redylye As terry dremyd: there they founde The treasoure and the good bronde. The swerd was bryght and styf I-now&yogh;e: Owt of the scuberd Gye it drowgh. 'God of hevyn,' quod Gye than, 'Where this euer longyd to crysten man? Never be-fore saw I such a brande. Hit was made in fer londe.' The pomell was corven euery deale With brynned gold nobly well. Of that swerd Gye was full fayne, And put hyt into the sheth a-geyne. Then he seyd to sir terrye, 'This treasoure that thow syeste here lye, Take thow all to thy poweste, But this swerd shall dwell with me.' 'Sir,' quod terry, 'at your wyll. Of treasure have I sone my fyll. There is so gret sorrow in my thought, That of treasoure rech I now&yogh;t. To the Cite will we gange: Me thynketh we dwell here to long.' 'Par fay, gladly,' quod sir Gye: Both they went forth in hye. Terry was a-gaste knowen to be Of som man that shuld hym see. When they comyn to that Cyte Sory man and wery was he. They herborowed them at the townes ende: After mete and drynke gan they send. Sir Gye rose vp, full hardelye, And lefte hys swerd with sir terrye, And hyed hym faste to the towre, To speke with the emperoure. The Emperoure from chyrch come, Gye hym mete or he com home. Gye hym gret well curteslye As he cowd, well securlye. 'God save yow, my lord, sir Emperoure,' Quod Gye, 'and yeve yow much honoure. A pylgrym I am of ferr contree: I aske some good for charite. Of your helpe have I mystere As ye mow se in all manere.' Quod the emperour, 'full gladlye I wyll the help, be seynt marye. To my paleys thow com with me: Thow shalte have mete gret plente.'", "102": "Tho they commyn to the hall The emperour and hys men all, The which a-non to mete yode, And euer sir Gye before hym stode. 'Pylgrym,' quod the Emperoure, 'Tell me, I pray the par amoure, Where were thou born & in what contre? Thow semyst well travellyd to be.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'ye may vndyrstond That I haue be in meny a londe, In ierusalem and in surrey, In constantyne the noble, for-soth, was I.' 'Pylgrym,' he seyd, 'be thy lewte, What seyth men ther of me?' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'ye shall here: Both shame & also harme in all manere, When ye thorough false counceyle Of the steward, that may not avayle, Hath banesshyd terry, the noble kny&yogh;t, And meny an other with-owt ryght; Therfor ye havyth, sir, a shame, And in this land much blame. Ye do your-selfe gret dyshonoure To leve so well that losyngoure.' When duke berrard herd what Gye seyd, He be-gan vp to brayde. He faryd as a wod man, And he wold have smytten Gye than, But men hym held that stodyn bye, That he dyd no harme to Gye. He seyd, 'thow lyest, false treytour: I was neuer losyngoure. Yf hyt ne were for dyshonoure Of my lord the Emperoure, I shuld shake thy berd so sore, Thy teth shuld fall owte the be-fore. Thow art a trowant swyth stronge: Thys lyf hast thow led full longe.

I seyd none other thyng Here vnto my lord the kyng, But with synne and vnryght Ye have dystroyed terry the kny&yogh;t, And chasyd hym owte of this land, For that ye beryth hym wrong on hand, That your cosyn shuld be dede Thorough hym and thorough hys rede: Ofte I have herd trewlye 1 [That he was nothynge geltye.' Then spake \u00fee dewke wyth yre, 'Be god, that made water and fyre,] 1 1_1 These three lines, wanting in the Caius MS., are taken from the MS. in the University Library, Cambridge, ll. 9234-6. That thow were that ilke kny&yogh;t That durst for sir terry fyght!' Gye answeryd with-owte more (He saw the Duke agrevyd sore), He seyd, 'yf my lord the emperoure wyll Fyndyn Fyndyth MS. me that longith tyll, Lo me here, sir, all redye To take the bateyle for sir terrye. He slew neuer the Duke Otoun, The false Duke, that wyked glotoune.' Quod Gye to the emperoure, 'Have here my wed, for your honoure: With hym, for-soth, wyll I fyght, And help sir terry in hys ryght.' The Emperoure with mornyng chere Toke the wed of Gye there. He seyd, 'pylgrym, so god the save, All that the nedyth thow shalt have.' With that he began to sygh sore, So dyd all that there wore. Vp stert berrard, the gret syre, As man that was full of tene and Ire. 'Pylgryme,' he seyd, 'thow arte full stowte, Prowd, and bold, with-owte dowte, When thow haste wagid thys bateyle; For I the sey, with-owt fayle, The devyll the bad do this dede. Thow haste hym seruyd: thys ys thi mede. The grace of god be me berevyd But I smyte of thy he[v]ed.' 'Sir Emperoure,' quod Gyoun, 'Herkyn here to my reasoun: Here ys no man that knoweth me; Com I am from fer contree. Armoure have I none redye Ne gold where-with to bye. As ye beth man of much myght, To helpe the pore thorough ryght, And at ned to do hym socoure Hit ys to yow gret honoure.' To-fore the Emperoure they stod ychone, Both her weddus he toke anone. Sethen he commaundyd hem anone ry&yogh;t Erly on the morrow to be dyght. He wyll algate the bateyle see: see ] be do MS. He bad erlych it shuld be. be so MS. The Duke yod home full swyth Full of wrath and vnblyth. The emperoure clepyd hys dow&yogh;ter dere, And bad her in all manere She shuld kepe the pylgrym well, And arme hym both in Iren and stele. She dyd as her fader her bad, And into chamber she hym lad. She wold hym cloth & bathe wele, But therof wold he neuer a dele. He bad her for god all-my&yogh;t To arme hym well at all ryght. All the men of that Cyte Had wonder what yt my&yogh;t be That durst ayenst the duke fy&yogh;te: They prayed for hym both day and ny&yogh;t, That god shuld geve the pylgrym grace To slee the Duke in the place. Full Erly rose the Emperoure, And herd masse with grete honoure. To hys paleyse ys he gone With hys barounus euery-chone. All redy was the Duke berrard As stowte as a lyon other lyberd, Armyd vpon a stede: To the court men Gon hym lede. I wote the mayd for-yate nought, To arme the pylgrym was all her thought: She dyd [hym] have a well good stede, That seker was at euery nede. Hys good swerd for-yate he nought: Hyt was full prevyly to hym brought; He dyd hyt fett from sir terry, That no man saw, full prevylye. Therof he had gret mystere, As ye shall afterward here. Well she armyd hym that may In all maner that he couth say. She brought hym to the emperoure, That was a man of gret honoure. All the men that The second t added in another ink. sye sir Gye Of hym they had gret ferlye; For he was so feyre and wyght, When he was armyd at hys ryght. All they sware be seynt Richere That was not the pore palmere That toke the bateyle for to fy&yogh;te: He semyd well a dow&yogh;ty knyght.' 'Lordyngis,' quod the Emperoure, 'Herkenyth to me par amoure. These two kny&yogh;tis, that stondyth here, They beth men of grete powere: A bateyle they have wagid here, Well ye wote in whate manere.

Now shall ye see this bateyle Hastyly with-owten fayle.' All they seyd at on assent, 'We wyll hyt se with good entent.' Oppon an hyll be-syd the Cite Ther was the bateyle ordeyned to be. The boke was brought hem be-forne: When they had her othes sworne, To the hyll gan they gone, And to-gedyr smote anone. Ther be-gan a gret bateyle: Eyther gan other fast assayle.", "103": "Tho smote they to-gedyr faste, Whiles ther wepon wold laste. There be-gan a stronge fyght: They smot on helmys, that were bryght. They brekyn steroppis and paytrellis, And theyre sperys euery-deale, But her hawberkis wold not ryve. Down of theyre stedis gan they dryve. Now be they on the erth both: Full sone I wene they will be wroth. On her stedys they lepyn, sans dowt; Non dred other: they were so stowt. They drew swerdys stowt and stronge, And fought to-gedyr swyth long. The dyntis on helmys were so stoute, That all the hyll dynned a-bowt. They breke hawberkis and shyldys: The pecis flow into the fyldys. Sir Gye was armyd well thore, But the Duke had armour more: He had two helmys styf and bry&yogh;t, And two hawberkis for dred of fy&yogh;t. They were set with preciouse stonys All a-bowte for the nonys. Well grete and stronge was that bateyle: Her horse were stronge, with-owt fayle. They seyd a-mong hem eche man That seyen the bateyle than That Gye was erthly man none: Of hevyn he was an angell one, Other ellys a man of fer londe: He my&yogh;t not ellys the Duke with-stond. Whether of hem were the hardyer Wyst they not that ther were. All the Cite, with-owt fayle, Comyn to se that bateyle: Men and women, chyldren also, Monkis and frerys thedyr gan go; Lasse and more in that Citee All they comyn that bateyle to see, But all only syr terry, That laye in the church speciallye, Preying to god that he wold here And helpe hym in hys gret mystere. In there com a preste goande, That found terry ther liggand. 'Pylgrym,' quod the prest than, 'Thow arte an ouer-holy man. Whi wylt not thow to the mounteyn go To se the bateyle be-twene knytis two? A pylgrym ys that on full ryght, That for the Erle terry doth fyght.' 'What ys that pylgrym?' quod terry. 'Ine wot,' he seyd, 'securlye, But he ys dow&yogh;ty in the fyld, And brokyn he hath the Dukis shyld.' Vp a-rose Terry tho anone, And to the bateyle ys he goon. He was adrad men shuld hym knowe: He lokyd amonge the men full lowe. There he saw the Duke berrarde, Hys armoure rent, and bled full harde. He had Ioy with-owt care That he saw Berrart so fare. Euer the pylgryme assayled hym faste. 'Lord,' quod terry at the laste, 'That ys not the same palmere That was yesterday my fere. Thys ys a bold man and a wyght: Hyt semyth hym to be a gentyll kny&yogh;t. He was lene and febull of myght, An hongry man and euyll I-dyght; This man ys wyght and no-thyng wan: I wene hit ys none erthly man. When I hym se I thynke on Gye: He ys full lyke hym, securlye. Yf Gye were not ded, I wold seye That this were he, be thys daye.' Tho for Gye he wept full sore. He yod to church, and held hym thore. Euer he prayed to god that daye To helpe as he well maye. That bateyle last full longe, Fro the morrow erly vnto the euynsonge: Yet ne wold they leve the fyght Tyll hyt were the derknyght. They ne wiste what they my&yogh;t seye; For they lakkyd the lyght of the daye. Messyngerys ther were sente, To the Emperoure sone they wente. They told hym that yt was ny&yogh;te, They my&yogh;t no lenge se to fyght. Anon he dyd klepe with honoure Fowre barouns of gret valoure. 'Lordys,' quod the Emperoure, 'Here hath bene an herd stoure. Take ye berrard to yow nowe, And kepyth hym well, I commaund yow, As I in yow trewly affye: Yeld hym to me to-morrow erly; And I shall kepe the pylgryme well Tyll to-morrow, so have I hele: Then shall they to-gedyr goo, Then shall we wete which of hem two Shall have the victorye Thorow the grace of god in hye.' 'Sir,' they seyd, 'all redye.' They were departyd sone in hye. They toke berrard, that noble kny&yogh;t, And kept him hem MS. well all that ny&yogh;t, But berrard, that false glotoun, Thought all-wey to do treasoun: Foure bold cosyns he had, And full prevyly he hem bad That they shuld to courte goo, And prevyly the pylgrym sloo. They armyd hem hym MS. in haste anone, And com to courte euery-chone. They entryd full prevyly Into a chambre to sir Gye. He was leyd in softe bed: With clothes of gold hyt was be-spred. Hys kepers were all slepand, Was not one of hem wakand. Vp they toke the bed ryght there, And to the full see they hyt bere; And all-wey slept well faste sir Gye: But god hym helpe for hys mercye, Well sone drowned shuld he be! They cast all forth in-to the see. There was he passed with the se wawe Down a whyle and vp a thrawe. Sir Gye awakyd at the laste, And hys hede up he caste: He sawe the sterrys bryght shynand, But in no syd saw he the lande, But brod watre all abowte: Hyt was no wondre though he had doute. 'God,' he seyd, 'all weldande, That stablyssheth both watre and londe, Lord, now thow thynke on mee; For I am be-trayed now, I see. Lord, who hath do me thys ded? And I fyght for no mede, Ne for syluer ne for golde, But for my brother, my trowth to hold, And for to delyuer hym owte of peryle, That longe hath bene in excile Also power as he may bee. When I hym saw I had pyte: Some-tyme he was a noble kny&yogh;t. I wold dye for sir terry is ryght. For he ys now so wrechyd a wyght, A-geyne Berrarde I toke the fyght. Yf I had the traytour slayne, Terry shuld have hys land ageyne. Lord, yf hyt my&yogh;t so be That he had helpe thorou&yogh; me, And I wonne all hys land, And all the honoure to hys hand, Thow&yogh; I levyd but till that daye, Hit were my Ioy, for-soth I seye. But I am ded, well I wote: For me shall he neuer have state Thorought treason of the Duke barrard. Have he neuer of hevyn parte! He ys a thefe full of treason; God geve hym hys malyson!'", "104": "Tho ther com a good fysshere Fyshyng be sir Gye nere. The bed he saw far by fletand: He turned hys bot, and went nere-hand. Wondir he had what hyt were That in the see com fletyng there. He coniured hyt in all manere, When that he was comyn hyt nere: What he was he shuld saye, And yf he levyd on goddys laye. Vp he lyfte hys heed sir Gye, And to the fyssher he spake in hye: 'My frend,' quod Gye, 'have thow no dred; I leve in god, so god me spede.' Quod the fysher, 'art thow of this cite?' 'Yea, so god me sped,' seyd he. 'Thynkest thow not on that fyght Be-twene the pylgryme and the kny&yogh;t That the Emperoure dyd make Yesterday for terry ys sake?' 'For-soth,' quod he, 'I saw full ry&yogh;t The bateyle tyll the derke ny&yogh;t. The emperoure dyd departe hem late: He kept the pylgryme at the gate.' 'And I am,' seyd Gye, 'that ylke pilgryme That faught ageynst Duke berrardyne. We were departyd yesterny&yogh;t, For we my&yogh;t se no lenger for to fy&yogh;t. In-to a chambre I was brought: Of treason had I lytill thought. Into this bed was I done: I was wery, and slept full sone. I was be-trayed, I note howe: My dere frend, helpe me nowe. For the trouth god yave the, Att thys tyme have rewth on me.' The Fysher was for hym sory, And toke hym into hys bote in hye, And led hym forth home that ny&yogh;t, And kept hym with all hys my&yogh;te. The Emperoure a-rose well erlye, Mateyns and masse he herd in hye. Then he come in-to hys hall, And with hym hys barouns all. He bad hem bryng forth berrardyne, And afterward the pore pylgryme. The foure barouns, soth, gan wend, And brought the Duke so hende. He commaundyd at that tyme To bring forth that pylgryme. To the Emperoure gan they seye That the pylgryme was aweye: Both was awey he and hys bed, And hys wardeyns were all fled. Ther wiste no man where he was done. The Emperoure was wroth full sone: He sware be god and seynt marye All they shuld be hangyd on hye That had aloyned alyoned or alyoued MS. thys pylgryme And hys wardens, be seynt martyne. Tho spake he with full gret Ire To the Duke, the stoute syre: 'Thow Duke,' he seyd, 'with-owt stryfe, Bryng hym forth, vppon thi lyfe, That thow hast take oute of my kepyng, Other I shall Iuge the to hangyng. Ded or quyke bryng hym to me: Thow haste hym stolyn, well I se.' The Duke stert vp, with-owte doute, As man that was bold and stowte. 'Sir,' he seyd, 'now fynd I wele That ye love me neuer a deale. Ouer-longe have I servyd yow, And kept youre land to youre prow. Now ye wold Iuggyn me, But ye shall not, so must I the. Who that ys now here so hardye That wyll me greve or more anoye, I shall hym with my sword so smyte, That hys hede shall of as tyte. And ye they MS. that have me Iugid soo, I wyll ye wot, or I goo, That I shall wend into lumbardye, And gader power ryght hardye, And thorough thy land com ageyne: All that I fynd shall be slayne. I shall the dystroy euery deale.' He knew hys maner swyth well. I dare sey he was ryght wroth, And well faste he sware hys othe, Yf he wente he shuld be slayne; And he sware 'nay' full faste ageyne.", "105": "Tho com forth the fysshere: He seyd, 'sir Emperoure, wyll ye here? Heryth me, yf youre wyll be, Sir,' he seyd, 'for charyte. Of that pylgryme I can yow seye: I wote where he ys, by thys daye.' 'My frend,' quod the Emperoure, 'Sey me, so god yeve the honoure, And thow shalt have, be myn hede, An hundryth besauntis of gold rede.' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'full trewly I shall yow sey now in hye. To-ny&yogh;t well late was I gone Vnto the see to fysch a-lone. I found a-lofte a bed fletyng, And a kny&yogh;t therin lyggyng. I askyd hym what he was, And he me told all the case, How he was that pylgryme That fought with sir barrardyne. I leyd hym my bote with-ynne, And lad hym home to myn Inne. I hym kept all thys ny&yogh;t: Sendyth for hym a-non ryght.' 'My frend,' quod the Emperoure, 'For hym shall thou [haue] much honoure.' For the pylgryme tho he sent: He come to hys commaundment Hastyly, with-owten fayle, And was arayed to that bateyle. Now be-gyn they to-gedyr to fyght: They daltyn strokis anone ryght. With swerdys, that were so good of stele, They smote on helmys ryght well. Hit was wondre to se thoo The fyght that was be-twene hem two. They fought tyll vnderne of the day: All had wonder that hyt saye. The Duke was full of felonye: He smote to Gye with grete envye; He hyt hym on the helme full stoute, And fellyd the floures all abow&yogh;te. He brake the sercle evyn in two, He brake the good hawberke also. He replid hys face and his chyn, And of hys ryght cheke all the skyn. Adowne be hys shuldre the stroke gan glyd, And brake many a mayle be-syde, But in hys Flessh com hit nought: The grace of god was in hys thought. Out of the shyld he brake a quartere, As he wold The l of wold added above the line. draw hys swerd nere. There fell to ground sir Gye Gyes MS. skete Both an handys and on fete. Vp he sterte with-owte blame: Of that dede hym thought shame. He sterte forth as spekyll on fyre, And smote the Duke with gret Ire Vppon the helme, that was so clere (He smote a-wey a good quartere); As on that other helme with-all, That to the ground can he fall, And the here with all the face Fell ryght downe vnto the place. With hys swerd he smote tho Hys good hawberke evyn in two. The Ryght Arme and the shuldre also He smote there the body fro. He carfe hys bowellys and hys hyd: In-to the erth the swerd can glyde. Tho was he all at the grownd, He dyed in a lytill stounde. All the men that therby stode Spekyn that stroke much goode, And seyd there was no man levand That my&yogh;t yeve a gretter stroke with hand. Vppon the Erth Gye sett hym downe, And seyd, 'a, thow Duke fellown, Now nere-hand a[r]t thow for-lorne. Alas the tyme that thow were boren! A bolder kny&yogh;t was neuer lyvand, Ne neuer dow&yogh;tyer man of hand. Ne haddist thow be traytour, be seynt Richere, In all the world ne had bene thy pere.' By the corse he reste a whyle, Well the mountanaunce of a myle. All that abowte gan stond Seyd he was a kny&yogh;t of fe[i]r[y]-land. Now ys Gye to the Emperoure gon And to hys barouns euery-chone, And askyd yf terry shuld be quyte Of all perell and all dyspyte. All they seyd with on voyse, 'Yea, be hym that dyed on crose. All shall be for-yeve hym here Be leve of yow, sir Emperere.' 'Sir Emperoure,' quod sir Gye, 'Have mercy on the Erle terrye. I have defendyd that felony Ryght here be-fore your eye. Me thynkyth he shuld be quyte with ryght, When that I for hym dyd fy&yogh;te.' The Emperoure answeryd full tyte, 'He oweth well for to be quyte. All I forge So MS. = for|geve. the Erle terry Myn evyll wyll and myn envye. I shall delyuer hym all hys land With all the honoure into hys hand: Yf I wyste where he were, I wold delyuer hym full yare.' Gye hym answeryd, 'par mafaye, Ye shall hym see, yf that I maye.' 'My frend,' he seyd, 'full hastylye I byd the wend, and seke terry.' Of he dyd hys armoure bryght: The Emperoure wold hym fayer dy&yogh;t In Rich Robys two or thre, And make hym on of hys meyne, But therof wold be not thoo, But hys slaveyne and no mo. He went the Cite all abowte, And sowght terry with-owt dow&yogh;t. At the laste he hym fande At the church hys bedys byddand. 'A-ryse vp,' quod Gye, 'for cherite: The Emperoure hath sent after the.' Vp he held hys hede terry: 'Lord god,' he seyd, 'mercy! In whome may any man trowe, Other to tell hys cowncell now? Thow semyst well trew to bee, And now haste thow be-wrayed me. He wyll me slee, or I ete mete: For me shalt thow have yeftis grete. Thow shalt me be-tray, & do me shame: Alas that I the told my name! I wend thow haddyst bene good & trew. So well-a-way that I the knewe! I wyll go and wend with the: I may not fle, full well I se. Yf I dye hyt ys thorow the: God now have mercy on me!'", "106": "'TErry,' quod Gye, 'make good chere: Thow shalt sone good tydyngis here. The false Duke barrard ys dede (Of hys sowle can I no rede) Thorrought a pylgryme full hardye, That terry defendyd of felonye.' To-fore the emperoure tho he cam, Yet had he gret dred of blame. 'Sir Emperoure,' quod sir Gye, 'Lo here the Erle terrye.' On knees fell than sir terry: 'Sir Emperoure,' he seyd, 'mercye! Sir,' quod terry, 'here am I: Longe haue I bene full drery. I have bene in sorrow stronge Yere and halfe: me thynketh longe That I had neuer reste on daye, But that I have travellyd aye, To seche sir Gye yf I hym found Well far in meny an vncouth land. In Englond I herd seye, There he was noryshed and borne, in faye, That he was wente in excile; Therfor that lond ys in peryle. Now herd I seye that a pylgryme (Have he goddys benyson and myne!) He hath the Duke berrard shente: I hope god hath hym hether sent.' On knees then fyll sir terrye, And seyd, 'lord, for goddys love, mercy!' Dukis, Erlys gret plente, That were curteys men and free, Down they fell on knees anone, For terry they prayed euery-chone. The Emperoure be-held the Erle terry, For hym he waxed full sorye: The terys ran of hys eyen down. 'Terry,' he seyd, 'gentill baroun, Thow hast had full gret traveyle, Hyt semyth well, with-owten fayle. Of the I have gret pyte: Thys day thow shalt seasonyd be In all thy land, castell, and toure. Yet shalt thow have more honoure: I make the steward of all my lande, And hyt be-take in-to thy hande.' Then seyd all hys baronye, 'Sir Emperoure, graunt mercye!' The Emperoure kyssed sir terry, And for-yave hym all folye. felony? cf. l. 10101. Duke, baroun, and euery man All they kyssed sir terry than. All Ioyed in that Citee That terry, the kny&yogh;t so free, Was accordyd with the emperoure: All they spake of hym honoure. Quod the emperoure to sir terry, 'Sey me now, for seynt mary, What ys he that ylke pylgryme? Ys he thi brother or thy cosyn That faught with berrard so hastylye, To defend the of thi felony? I wend that ther had be no kny&yogh;t In the world the r of world added above the line. so bold a wyght, That durst ayenste berrard fy&yogh;t, But it wer foure or fyve well dy&yogh;t.' 'Sir,' quod terry, 'as I trow, And by the feyth that I to yow owe, Thys pilgrym saw I neuer are, But in the wey as I can fare, Ne neuer wyste or now ryght That he for me wold fyght; But now I wote, with glad mode I prey to hym that dyed on Roode Yeld hym hys mede with-owte fayle: He hath me delyuerd from gret traveyle.' The emperoure dyd hendly: To hys chambre he led sir terry; He clothyd hym nobly well In clothes lyned with sendell; He yave hym stedis ij or thre, The beste that were in that contre. He wente to Gornoyse hastelye, And wyth hym he led sir Gye.", "107": "TO the Cite com sir terry, And ys receyved nobelye. The pylgryme with hym he brought: That hyt was Gye wyste he nought. He sow&yogh;t hys cowntes thorow&yogh; the londe: At the laste he her fande. She was hyd for gret dowte For the duke that was so stowte. Now ys terry bold and wyght, Of all that lond moste of my&yogh;t. In all-mayne he doth hys wyll, What he lyste, lowd or styll. Terry for-yate in no manere The treasoure than that MS. in the Rochere That they found betwene hem two By the way as they gan goo. To gornoyse he dyd hyt bryng: Ther was many a rych thyng. He yave hyt all to sir Gye, But he wold none, securly: Of gold and syluer had he no thought, But to serue god, that hym bowght. And he bad yeve some pore man with hys hond, And with that other a-store hys land. Vppon a day sir Gye hym be-thought, Lenger to dwell ther wold he nought. He toke hys leve of sir terrye, And spake to hym well derley: 'Sir,' he seyd, 'now wyll I fare: With the may I dwell no mare. I pray yow, yf youre wyll be, That ye awhile rown with me: Such thyng now ye here saye, Ye wyll have wonder, by thys daye. But loke that no man come with yow.' 'Nay,' quod terry, 'as I trowe.' Terry lepe on a mule amblend: Thorought the Cite they went spekend. Must no man with hym goo, But they alone hem-selfe two. Forth they went to-geders her waye: Wiste no man what Gye wold seye. When they had go but a myle, They sett hem down to reste a while. 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'herken me now: Ye know me not, as I trowe. And yf ye vndyrstond wele, Ye cowd know me some deale. Can ye not that man know That some tyme was your felaw, That slew for yow the Duke otown, And delyuerd yow of hys presoun? And efte I found yow woundyd sare In a foreste as I gan fare, And sethen slew thevys fyftene, And brought thy lemman bry&yogh;t and shene, And the from foure knyghtis wanne, And slow hem there euery man, And on my horse led the a stounde, And helyd the of thy sore wounde, And sethen socoured thy fader dere, And halpe hym in many a mystere, amystere MS.

Terry my&yogh;t not on word speke: Hym thowght hys herte wold to-breke, To ground fell in sorrow then: More sorrow had neuer man. 'O sir Gye, my dere fellawe, Why my&yogh;t I the neuer knowe?

Ther he wept, and wrong hys hond: In the world ys noon man ) MS. levand Of so stronge herte that can hyt see, But That MS. of hym he my&yogh;t have pyte; And so had Gye so grete mornyng, That they fell both in sownyng. 'Terry,' quod Gye, 'my fellow dere, I wyll wend, ye shall dwell here. I the be-tech god all-my&yogh;te: He the kepe both day and ny&yogh;te.

And we both to-gedyr were, Though we hadden sorrow and care, Hyt shuld vs please, leve brother, And eyther of vs love well other.' 'My frend,' quod Gye, 'let be thy fare: Therof speke thow no mare.

Terry went home anone, In-to hys chambre ys he gone: Two dayes yet he no mete, Ne no man my&yogh;t of hym wordys gete. When the cowntes herd seye That Gye was passed so aweye, She blamyd her lord gretlye, That he ne had hold styll sir Gye: 'Yf he ne wold dwell for fayrenesse, Ye shuld have hold hym with dystresse.' Now wendyth Gye well drery, Ofte he thought on sir terrye. So longe hath Gye hys weyes gon, He passed landys many one: Commyn he ys to the see, And to Englond wold he.

'Where ys,' he seyd, 'the Erle rohold, A dow&yogh;ty kny&yogh;t and a bold?' 'Sir,' he seyd, 'par ma faye, He ys ded full many a daye.' Sir Gye gan pray specially, 'God on hys sowle have mercye.

They stode all styll, and lokyd down, As a man had shavyn ther crown. 'God,' he seyd, 'and seynt marie, That I am carefull and sorye, When I may not a kny&yogh;t Find with a nother to fy&yogh;t! O,' he seyd, 'sir Gye the wyght And sir herrawd, \u00fee dou&yogh;ty kny&yogh;t, Had I bene so ware and so wyse, And holdyn yow in my servyse, And yeven yow the thryd parte of my lond Other halfen deale in your hond, Ye wold have quyt me my mede: Than durst I not this Geaunt drede.

Had I yoven Gye so gret plente, That he had dwellyd in thys contre, He wold have quyt me full well All my traveyle euery-deale. Full bold be these danys, And gret cowardys the Englyssh, When I may not fynd a kny&yogh;t That dare with another fyght.' 'Syr kyng,' quod the erle of Kent, 'I wyll yow saye all myn entent: Do yow somown thorou&yogh; all your land, That they be redy at your hand: All shull they be well dy&yogh;t, And ayen the danys fy&yogh;t. Thorou&yogh; goddys grace we shull hem slone: Other cowncell gett ye none.' Kyng athelstone lay that ny&yogh;t In hys bed well I-dy&yogh;t: All that ny&yogh;t he lay wakand, And euer to god fast byddand That he wold hym send a man That durst do the bateyle than. And god of hevyn for-yate hym nou&yogh;t: As he lay in grettest thou&yogh;t, An angell come to hym full ry&yogh;t, And spake to hym from hevyn bry&yogh;t: 'Sir kyng,' he seyd, 'slepyst thow? To the me sent my lord Iesu: He bad the aryse vp full erlye, And to the church thow wend in hye. A pylgrym shalt thow fynd thare: Take hym home with the full yare. Byd hym for love and charyte, And for god, that dyed on tre, That he for the take the bateyle, And so he wyll, with-owten fayle.' With that the angell went awaye: The kyng gan wake, hyt was nere daye. He was a ryght Ioyfull man, For he had such tydyngis than. Sone to the church gan he goon With hys barons euerychone, And with hym two bysshoppus of the lond: To pryme of the day gan they stond. With that there come pore men To the church ix or ten: Among hem come a pylgryme. The kyng toke hym by the slaveyne, And seyd to hym in fayre manere, 'Come home with me, my frend dere. Be not afferd for no thyng: Thou shalt have good gestenyng.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'lett me stond styll: Yet to herborow have I no wyll. Here I go my mete byddand: Ryght late I com into thys land.' The kyng seyd, 'com with me: Full well at ease shall thow be.' The kyng and he to chambre went, After hys barons he hath sent. 'Pylgrym,' he seyd, 'for charyte And for hys love that dyed on tree, Helpe me now in this mystere With thy strenght and thi powere. A bateyle with danys have we tane: Fyght for vs, or we be slayne.", "110": "Lysten now, and thow shalt here How it ys and in what manere. Thourugh \u00fee my&yogh;t of on mannus hand Shall I wynne other lose my land: Ageynst a geaunt shall he fyght, In all thys world ys none so wy&yogh;t. The kyng Awlof, that ys now here, He ys so sykur of hys powere: He weneth ther be none lyvand That may hym stond a stroke of hand. For hys love I the praye That made both ny&yogh;t and daye, Thow take for me thys bateyle: God wyll the quyte with-owt fayle.' 'Sir,' quod Gye, 'lett be thy fare: Now to fyght byd me not yare. I am a wrech as ye may see, Also febull as I may bee.' Tho arose the kyng full hastylye, And fell on knees be-fore sir Gye. Dukis, Erlys well curtesly All they cryed Gye mercye, That he wold the bateyle take For Goddus love & for hys sake. Sir Gye be-held the kyng then, And with hym all other men, an other man MS. How they setten on her kne, And asked helpe for charyte. 'A-ryse vp,' quod sir Gye. 'Now ye all for help crye, I shall for yow do thys bateyle: With help of god wyll I not fayle.' Vp arose the good kyng, And kyssed sir Gye with-owt lettyng. Thorou&yogh; all the land was Ioy than That the kyng had found a man That with colbrond wold fy&yogh;t: 'He shall hym slee with goddys my&yogh;t.' They senten to awlof the kyng, And toldyn hym with-out lettyng That they had found a kny&yogh;t That wold ageyn the Geaunt fy&yogh;t Armyd Redy at the daye Which ys set, with-owt naye: 'All redy shall [he] be dyght, And defendyn defendyd ) MS. hys lordys ry&yogh;t.' When the day was come sone, And the bateyle shall be done, Gye was armyd, with-owte fayle, With an hawberke of dowble mayle; Vppon hys hed an helme ryght With a crest of gold well dy&yogh;t: Ther-on were many Rich stonys Of gret Vertu for the nonys. A Chaurbocle in the front was, That shone as bry&yogh;t as any glasse. Ther-with my&yogh;t men se any&yogh;t, As yf hyt had be the day ly&yogh;t. Theron was a coluer of gold, The Ioly creste in hys fote gan hold. Ther-abow&yogh;t ther was a floure Peynted well with rych coloure. Hosyn he had well I-dy&yogh;t Of yren and stele made for to fy&yogh;t. Sporrys he had on hys hele Of red gold euery-deale. Hys shyld he caste abow&yogh;t hys swere, A good swerd he toke there. They brought a sted to hys hand, The swyftest of all Englond. Vp he lepyd as a noble kny&yogh;t, And blyssed hym with hys hand ry&yogh;t. In hys hond he toke a spere, And into the place he hyt bere. When he was come into the place, To be-sech be shech MS. god of hys grace, Of hys sted he lepe a-downe, And lay long in a flyxowne. 'Lord,' he seyd, 'for thy passyoun, That savyd danyell fro the lyon, Save me from thys fowle fellown, And bryng me to savacioun, And lend me grace thys ilke daye (For well I wot that thow maye) To slee thys thefe with myn hond, And fro trowage save thys lond.' He blyssed hym with hys hand ry&yogh;t, And on hys sted he lepyd full ry&yogh;t: Styrrop ther towchyd he none; Therof spake many one. All they seyd that ther were A fayrer man saw they neuer. The booke broke MS. was brou&yogh;t brest MS. hem be-forne: Kyng Awlof hath fyrst sworne, Yf hyt be so that hys man fayle, And be convycte in that bateyle, In-to denmarke wyll he fare, And neuer do Englond harme mare, Ne hys Eyers fro that ny&yogh;t Neuer chalenge of Englond ry&yogh;t. Sethen sware kyng Athelstone, Yf hyt be so hys man be slone Be-fore hys barons euerychone, Ther in bateyle be for-done, He shall do Aulof ther homage, And yeld hym for hys land trewage. And, when they were sworne & accordyd in one, And ostagis estatis MS. for them both take anone, Then com forth that colbrond: Gret and strong was that Geaund. A Carte onneth my&yogh;t hym bere The Armoure he brought with hym to were. He wold no horse to hym a-dy&yogh;t, But on fote wold he fyght. That ylke Geaunt was full starke: Vppon hym he had a good hawberke. Mayled hawberke hyt was nought, Of stele gaddys was hyt wrought, That hylled all hys gret bodye, Armes, and all, sekurly. Hys hosyn were of the same entayle Well I-wrought, with-owt fayle. Hys helme was styf and stronge than: He drad no stroke of englyssh man. He had a swerd of good stele: A man my&yogh;t not hyt bere wele. He had a shyld full brod tho (Was neuer non better, so must I go), With Iren and stele all ouer-led: Hyt was the devyllys as men seyd. Many a man was of hym a-drad: All was blake that he on had. A spere full long he had in hond, Many a wepun he mad be hym stond: Sherpe sperys stod hym abow&yogh;t, And long gleyves a full gret row&yogh;t, Gauelongis to cast with hys hond, And sharp geserns, I vndyrstond, Gret axys also with-all To hewyn with yren or stelle small. Hym-selfe was dy&yogh;t full securly: Men wondryd on hym tha[t] stodyn by.", "111": "NOw be they set to-gedyr thore: Sir Gy hym dred swyfe sore. He was neuer so adred of man As he was of hym than. Sir Gye smote hys sted full ry&yogh;t, To colbrond he can hym dy&yogh;t. Ere he my&yogh;t com hym nere He met with hym in thys manere: Thre dartis he shote full tyte; The two passyd, the thyrd gan byte. Thorrow the shuldre the darte yode, And thorough the hawberke, that was good: Betwene hys arme and hys syd The stroke gan awey glyde. Gye smote then with herte good To colbrond ther he stode A my&yogh;ty stroke in the sheld, The l added above the line. That a pece flye in-to the feld. Colbrond lyfte vp hys brond in haste, And ment to sir Gye a stroke in waste. Sir Gye wold have stert be-syd, But he hym yave a stroke that tyd. Vpon hys helme he wend well To have smytten him hem MS. with hys swerd of stele, But be-twene sir Gye and hys arsown Fell the stroke of that fellown. He smote hys sted evyn in two: Hys swerd in-to the erth gan go. Gy fell down to the grounde, But up he stert in a stounde. Hys good swerd tho he drew owt, And smote to hym a stroke full stow&yogh;t Also hard as he my&yogh;t drye, But he myght hym not rech for hye. Gye my&yogh;t vp-ryght by hym stond, And hys swerd in hys hond, To hys shuldre my&yogh;t he wynne, But no hy&yogh;er for no gynne. On the shuldre fell that dynte, For the hawberke wold hyt not stynte. A grete pece he smote of tho, And the Flessh he carfe also. The blod ran down to hys syd: He had a grete wound and a wyde. Colbrond lykyd that stroke full yll, And smote to Gye with good wyll: On Gyes helme he smote so faste, The sercle of gold all to-braste; A-down he fellyd the flowres all. On the sheld the dynt gan fall: The good shyld he carfe in two; Tho was Gye carefull and woo. He saw halfe be-fore hym lye, Be-hynd hym the tother partye. Tho he hurte hym ryght sore, Vp he caste hys swerd thore. He smote the geaunte on the shyld: Meny a man the stroke be-held. The bond of iren all to-roofe, Other halfe fote the sheld cloofe. With gret my&yogh;t and mayne As he drew hys swerd ageyne, Hys good swerd brake in two: Tho was sir Gye full woo. Now ys comyn hym feble grace: Hys sheld ys brokyn in the place, And, worste of all, hys swerd good. 'God,' he seyd, 'that dyed on Rood, Why am I thus evyll dyght? And I for Englond fyght, For to save hyt fro trowage: Why ys me fallyn that owtrage?' Now be these danys stow&yogh;t and prowd, And seyen ecchone, with-owte dow&yogh;te, Englond lorne shall be. Kyng athelston aferd was he. 'Syr kny&yogh;t,' quod than colbrond, 'Thy swerd ys broken in thy haud: Thow haste no wepyn, that I may see, Where-with thow my&yogh;t defend the. Yeld the now to me in hy&yogh;e: Of the wyll I have mercy. For that thow were so bold & wyght, Ayen me that thow durst fyght, To kyng athelston Read Aulof? wyll I goon, And make the and hym at-oon: Castell and toure shalt thow none fayle, And thow do after my counceyle.' 'Nay,' quod Gye, 'so must I thee, Shall I neuer traytoure bee. Though my swerd be now a-wey, My lord of heven, that well maye, May make the lose thy good brond, That ys so sykur in thy hand. Thow haste wepun gret plente: Ther-of I byd the thou lend som to me, Then shall we se sone in hye Who shall have the mastrye.' 'Fellow,' quod than Colbrond, 'So me helpe tormagaunte, Wepon for me shalt thow none have, But now shall I sle the me MS. with my staffe. I wene hyt were me full Ill To lend the wepon at thy wyll. Or thow shall do me ony scath Here shalt thow lose thy hed rath.' When Gye herd hym so speke, For tene hys herte wold to-breke. 'No forse,' quod Gye, 'wylt thou so done: I wyll have wepon well sone. Lo where commyth on be-hynd the That bryngyth me wepon plente!' Colbrond lokyd be-hynd hym tho: He thought well what he wold do; He sterte forth, or he wold stynte, And a good axe in hys hand he hend. Then seyd Gye with gret Ire To colbrond, the gret sire, 'Now,' seyd Gye, 'have thow mawgry: Now have I of thy wepon plenty.' When colbrond saw that dede, He stert forth as man in nede. With all hys strenght he smote to Gye, But he sterte bake in hye. As Iesu cryste ys wyll was (Hyt was a full wondre cas), The swerd in-to the ground gan dryve Thre fote also blyve, And, as he after the swerd gan stoupe, Gye hym smote with-owte dow&yogh;te: With both handys the axe he hente, And yave the Geaunte a gret dynte. Hys ryght arme he smote aweye: Hys swerd vpon the ground laye. Tho was the Geaunte full sory, And to hys swerd he sterte in hye: With hys lyfte hand he wold assay, For the ryght hand was awey. Ryght as he be-gan to stoup than, Gye wente nere as a hardy man: Hys good axe he reryd on hye With both handys full my&yogh;tyly: He smote hym in the neke so well, That the hed flye of euery-deale. The geaunte ded on the erth laye, The danys mad gret sorrow that day: The king aulof was well sorye, And all hys men that stod hym bye. To theyre shyppys be they wente All for-shamyd and for-shente. Ioyfull was the kyng athelstone And hys barons euerychone: They toke sir Gye hem amonge, And led him hed hem MS. forth with mery song To wynchestre, the good cyte. All the clergy of that contree Comyn with gret precession, And ladden sir Gye into the town. And as they gan hym homward bryng, 'Te deum laudamus' gan they syng. Gye on-armyd hym there, And askyd hys slavyn and no more. mere? MS. The kyng clepyd hym in prevyte, And prayed hym for charyte That he shuld hym the soth seye, What was hys name, with-owte naye. He wold hym yeve londys wyd, Castellys, and towers on euery syd. With hym he shuld dwell thare: Nobly well shuld he fare. Of all the men in that contree Most honowred shuld he be. 'Therof,' seyd Gye, 'speke ye now&yogh;t: Hyt ys nothyng in my thou&yogh;t. I wyll not therof, securlye, The mowntans of an halpenye. I have done thys bateyle: Thankyd be god of hys cownceyle. He lent me both streng[t]h & my&yogh;t Ayenst the Geaunt for to fy&yogh;t. Of all that I have now don for the Thanke hyt god and nothyng me.' 'Mercy, pylgryme,' quod the kyng, 'For hys love that mad all thyng, And shed hys blod on the rode For mannus sowle and mannus good, Tell me now, with-owt blame, Where were thou bore, & what ys thy name?' The pylgrym seyd, 'ye shall here: Sith ye wyll wyt in all manere, Than commyth, yf your wyll be, Alone owt of the Cyte with me. Then shall ye the soth here, What I am, with good chere, So that ye be-wray not me Now here in thys contre.' Owt of the town gan they goo Alone, and no mo but they two. When they were passyd halfe a myle Gye seyd, 'sir, abyd a whyle. Syr,' he seyd, 'now shall you here This line added in the margin in the same hand. What ys my name with good chere. Sir,' he seyd, 'I am Gye ryght Of Warewyke, your owen kny&yogh;t. Some-tyme ye lovyd me full dere: Now am I such as ye se here.' When the kyng wyst vtterly That hyt was the noble Gye, On hys knees he sett hym downe Ryght ther be-fore sir Gyoun. 'Pylgrym,' seyd the kyng, 'mercy! Art thow the noble kny&yogh;t sir Gye? Full longe hyt ys syth I herd seye That thow were ded & all aweye. Thankyd be god hevyn kyng That I have herd of the tydyng. Thys day halfen-deale Englond I wyll sease into thyn hand Euer-more quyte and free. Two leaves of the MS. are want|ing here. 'What art thow that seyest such thyng? Art thow god, of hevyn kyng?'

He was glad of hys maundement That god of hevyn hym had sent. When the tyme was com ny&yogh;e That he wyste that he shuld dye, To hym he clepyd hys page hend. The e of hend altered from o. 'Fellow,' he seyd, 'thow must wende To warwyke with-owten more.

The page was full sone I-dy&yogh;t, To warewyke he come anone full ry&yogh;t. The cowntesse he found full redy thare: He sett hym on hys knees full bare.
