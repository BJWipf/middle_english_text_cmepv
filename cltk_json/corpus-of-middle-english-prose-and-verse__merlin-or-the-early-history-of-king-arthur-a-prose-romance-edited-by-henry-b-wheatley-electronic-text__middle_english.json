CONSULTATION OF DEVILS, AND BIRTH OF MERLIN. Fvll wrothe and angry was the Deuell, whan that oure lorde\nhadde ben in helle, and had take oute Adam and Eve, and\nother at his plesier; and whan the fendes sien that, they hadden\nright grete feer and gret merveile; thei assembleden to-gedir,\nand seiden, \"What is he this thus vs supprisith and\ndistroyeth, in so moche that our strengthes ne nought ellis that we\nhaue may nought with-holde hym, nor again hym stonde in no\ndiffence; but that he doth all that hym lyketh, we ne trowe not\nthat eny man myght be bore of woman, but that he sholde ben\noures, and he that thus vs distroyeth, how is he born in whom we did knowe non erthely delyte.\"  Than ansuerde anothir fende\nand seide, \"He this hath distroyed that which we wende sholde\nhaue be mooste oure a-vaile.  Remembre ye not how the prophetes\nseiden, how that god shulde come in to erthe for to saue the\nsynners of Adam and Eve, and we yeden bysily a-boute theym\nthat so seiden, and dide them moste turment of eny othir pepill,\nand it semed by their feire semblant, that it greved hem but\nlitill or nought, but they comforted hem that weren synners, and\nseide that oon sholde come, which sholde delyuer hem out of\ntharldome and disese. So longe haue thei spoken of hym, that now is he comen,\nand hath taken from vs tham, that non othir ne myght us\nbereve; ye knoweth well that he maketh hem to ben waisshen\nin a water in the name of the fader, sone, and holy goste, and\nafter that have we no powre vpon them, but yef they do turne a-gain to vs by their euell werkis.  In this wise hath he putt\ndown oure power, and yet more-ouer ffor hath his mynystres lefte\nin erthe that dayly hem saueth from vs, thow&yogh; they haue don\nneuer so many of oure werkes, yef they will repent and for-sake\ntheir myslyvinge, and do as they teche hem that ben for the\ngrete loue he hadde to man and gret tendirnesse, whan for to\nsaue man he wolde come down in to erthe to be born of a\nwoman, and we yede and assaied hym in alle the maners that\nwe cowden, and when we hadde assaied hym, and we dyd that synne nought fynde in hym, yet wolde he dye for to saue\nman, fful moche lovede he man when he w olde suffer so\ngrete peyne for to haue hym a-gein, and to take hym from oure\npower.  Thanne moche oughte we for to laboure with grete\nbesynesse to gete agayn that he hath us be-raffte in soche wyse,\nthat they may not repente ne speke with hem that myght gete\nhem pardon, and turne hem agayn ffrom our power.\"  In this\nmaner the fendes helden a gret conseill, and seide that tho that\nhadde greued hem moste that were they that tolde tydinges of\nhis comyng in to erthe, and they haue don vs gret damage and\nhynderyng, and the more they tolde of his comyng, the more\nwe dide hem anger and disese, and as vs semeth he hasted hym\nthe rather to come for to delyuer them from our daunger. But how myght we haue a man of oure kynde that myght speke and\nhaue oure connynge and maystrie worke, and haue the\nknowleche as we haue of thinges that be don and seide, and of\nthynges that be past, and that he myght be in erthe conuersant\nwith these other, for witeth it wele that soche on myght moche\nhelpe us to be-gile his pepill, like as the prophetes be-giled us,\nand tolden that we trowe neuer myght haue ben.  In the same wise sholde sithe oon telle alle thynges that were don and\nsaide bothe of that is passed and of thynges that is to come,\nand be that sholde he be bileved of moche peple.  Than thei\nansuerde alle and seiden, that wele hadde he sped that soche a\nman myght gete, for he sholde be beleved of all thinges that\nhe seide.  Than ansuerde a-nothir fende and seide, \"I have\npower for to sowe seede in woman, and make her conceyve, and\nI have oon that doth all that euer I wille; and thus vndirtoke he\nthis enterprise to gete a man that sholde do their werkes after\ntheir alle entente.  Ffull grete foles were thei whan they wende\nthat oure lorde sholde haue no knowynge of their ordenaunce,\nand enquire thus they departed from this conseille and were\nassented to this conclusion, and this feende that toke this\nenterprise ne taried not, but in al the haste that he myght, he come\nther, as this woman was that wrought all his wille; and when\nhe com their he fonde here at his likynge, whiche yaf to hym\nall her part of that she hadde, and here lord was right a ryiche\nman. This riche man hadde grete plente of bestes and of othir\nrichesse, and also he had thre doughters and a sone by\nthis woman in whom the deuell hadde so grete power.  This\nfeende ne forgat not as he that not elles desired but hir to\ndisceyve and to shame; and he axed of hir, \"How myght I,\"\nquod he, \"gete thy lord on my part;\" and she ansuerde that in\nno maner wise lesse than he were wratthed; \"and,\" quod she,\n\"thow maist sone make hym wrothe, for he is right hasty.\"\nThan wente this deuell to this gode mannes bestes, and kylled\nof hem grete plente; and when the heirdes sye their bestes so\ndeyen in the feldes, thei merveyled gretly, and tolde their\nmaister the mervelle of the moreyn, that was fallen a-monge the\nbestes.  Whan the gode man herde this he gan to wratthe, and\nmerveyled gretly what was cause of the moreyn; and axed of\nthe heirdes.  Quod he, \"Know ye ought what thise bestes eiled\nthus for to dye?\"  And they ansuerde \"Nay;\" and so it passed\nforth all that tyme, and anon as the feende sye that the gode\nman was wroth for so litill, he dought that yef he dide hym gretter damage, that he The word \"he\" is inserted above the line. wolde be moche wrother, and so myght\nhe haue hym the more atte his wille, and so he yede to x gode\nhorse whiche that the gode man hadde, and slowe hem alle in a\nnyght.  And when the gode man sye his gode go to so gret\nmyschef, he gan to be angry, and seide a worde of grete ire, for\nhe yaf to the deuell all the remenant that was lefte. And whan the deuell knewe that he hadde youed hym soche\na yefte, he was right glad, and hasted hym to do hym\nmore damage, for he spared nothynge that he myght devoure;\nand than was the gode man sorowfull and angry, and fled\ncompany of peple for hevynesse, that he was moche soell by hym\nself; and than wiste the deuell wele that he shulde haue his will\nfro thens-forth.  Thanne come this feende to a feire sone that\nhe hadde, and hym straungeled in his bedde slepynge, so that on\nthe morowe he was founden dede.  Than this gode man ferde\nas a man out of reson for hevinesse and sorowe that he hadde\nloste so his sone, and fill in dispeire; and when the feende sye\nthis he was glad, for than he hadde all his desier with-oute\nrecouerer. Than wente he to the woman that hadde made hym\nall to wynne, and made her go up on a grete huch and tye a\ncorde a-boute a perche, and knyt it a-boute her nekke, and made\nher distende fro the huch, so that she henge her-self and was\nstrangelid to deth, and when the gode man saugh that he hadde\nloste bothe his sone and his wif in soche manere, he made gret\ndoell, so that he dyed for gret sorowe and hevynesse, and thus\ndoth the deuell to them that he may ouercome, and soche as he\nfyndeth at his wille; and when he hadde thus don he was right\nglad, and devised how he myght best disceyve the thre doughtres\nof this riche man whiche were lefte, and he vndir-stode wele that\nhe myght nat disceyve them in no manere, but yef it were with\nsom mans werke, where-in thei sholde haue delyte.  And he\nhadde a yonge man in the town, whiche was moche disposed after\nhis entent, and redy to inclyne to his werkes; and so he stered\nthis man, that he come to the oon of these sustres, and thourgh the deueles entysement, that he lay by hire.  And than was the\nfeende wele pleseth, and than wolde he neuer cesse till he hadde\nmade it openly knowen, for to make hir vtterly shamed and\nstroied; ffor that tyme it was the lawe yef a woman myght be\nfounde in fornication that she sholde, by Iustice of the lawe, be\nput to deth, but yef that she wolde abandone hir body to alle\nmen as a comen woman. The man fledde a-wey, and the woman was taken and ledde\nbe-fore the Iuges, where-of they hadde grete pite for\nloue of hir fader, whiche was right a worthy man, to whom weren\nfalle many myshappes with-in shorte tyme, for he was oon of the\nwurshipfullest men of all the contre.  Not-withstandynge they\nmoste do hir the lawe, and so they acorded that she shulde be\ndolven in the erthe by nyght by cause of her frendes.  In the\ncontre was ther a gode holy man, that herde speke of this\nmerveyle, and he com for to speke with the tow sustres that were\nlefte, and he comeforted hem gretely, and axed of hem this\naventure was be-fallen of their fadir and modir, and of hir suster,\nand hire brother; and they ansuerde that thei wiste not, safe only\n\"that god hateth vs, and suffreth vs to have this turmente.\"\nQuod the gode man, \"Ye sey amysse, for god hateth no creature,\nbut is euell pleseth, whan that synners haten hym by thaire\nwerkes; and, ther-fore, wyte ye well that this is the\nencombraunce of the deuell, and wyte ye ought, what dede your suster\nhadde don, that ye haue hir loste in this wise.\"  And they seide,\n\"Nay.\"  Than this holy man counselled hem to be wele ware,\nand kepe hem fro euell dedes, for synne draweth bothe man and\nwoman to myshevouse ende.  And so he taught and enformed\nhem here creaunce and feith.  The elther suster vndirstode hym\nwele, and gretly was plesed with his doctryne, and the holy\nman lerned her to love god and drede god; and she peyned hir\ngretly to do as he hir taughte, and to contynue in gode\nlyvinge.  And he seide to hir, \"Yef ye truste that I sey vnto yow, grete\ngode and comfort ye shall fynde ther- fro , and ye shull be my\ndoughter in god, and in what nede that euer ye haue I will not fayle, but I will be redy to helpe yow, and counseile yow with\nhelpe of our lord god; and dismaye yow not in no maner, but\ntrust verely in god, and often repeireth to me, for I duell not fer hens.\"  Thus this holy man counselled these sustres, and set\nhem in gode wey; the eldeste yaf gode credance to this holy man,\nand loved wele his blissed techynge, and his gode tales that he\ntolde hem euery day.  When the deuell sye this, he was euell\nplesed ther-with, and hadde grete fere to lese his labour aboute\nthem, and he dought that he myght not wynne hem by felschip\nof man, with-oute counseille of some woman; and he hadde oon in\nthe town that ofte hadde don his wille.  This woman the deuell\nbrought to these sustres, and she toke the yonger in counseill\nand frayned her of many dyuerse thynges, and of the maner of\nhir lyuynge.  Quod she, \"How doth youre suster? loueth she\nyow wele as she ought to do?\"  Quod the mayden, \"My suster\nis so hevy and pensif of oure mys-happes that right seilden she\nmaketh eny mery chere to me, ne to noon other, and that maketh\nan holy man that ofte speketh with hire, that she doth nothynge\nbut as he will.\"  \"Ha!\" quod she, \"euell spende ye youre\ntyme of that feire body that ye haue, that never shull haue ioye\nwhile ye be in her company.\"  \"Now, feire love,\" quod she,\n\"yef ye knewe what ioye other women haue ye sholde preyse\nlitill alle othir thynges; ffor we haue soche ioye when we be in\ncompany of men that we loven, that yef we hadde but a mossell\nbrede, we haue more ioye and delyte than ye haue with alle the\ndelicatys of the worlde.  Fye! what ioye hath a woman\nwith-oute man?  Ffeire love, this I sey for yow that knowen not\nwhat it is to be in mannes company, and I will telle you why:\nyoure suster is elder than ye, and so she wolde alwey holde yow\nas her sogect, so that she myght have all, and so shold ye loose\nyoure tyme, and the ioye of youre feyre body.\"  And answerde,\n\"How shulde I be so hardy to do as ye telle me, ffor my suster\nther-fore was putte to deth.\"  Quod this othir, \"Youre suster dede\nlike a fooll, and hadde but sympell counseill, but yef ye will do\nafter me, ye shall haue all the delyte of youre body with-oute\neny lettynge.\"  \"I wote now,\" quod she, \"ne I dar no more speke with you at this tyme, for my suster; but go youre wey,\nand anothir tyme, we shall speke more at leyser.\"  And when\nthe Deuell herde this he was glad, and wiste wele he sholde haue\nalle his will.  And when this woman was goon, the mayden\nbe-thought her often-tymes of that she hadde seyde vnto hire;\nand when the deuell sye that she spak ofte sythes so to hir-self\na-lone, he put in hir mynde all that he myght, so that on\na nyght she be-heilde hir fayre body, and seyde to hir-self,\n\"Truly,\" quod she, \"the gode woman that spake with me seyde\nfull trewe.\" Tho it happed on a day after that, she sente after this woman,\nand she com.  \"Truly,\" quod she, \"ye seyde me soth\nthat my suster set but lytill prise of me.\"  And she ansuerde\nthat, \"I wist it wele, and yef will she haue lesse, so she haue hir\nowne delyte, and we be made for noon other cause, but for to\nhaue counfort and ioye of mannes felishep.\"  And the mayde\nsede, \"I wolde gladly, yef I sholde not be deed ther-fore.\"  And\nthe olde woman seyde to hir, \"Yef ye do as folily, as your syster\ndede, ye sholde be deed therfore, but I shall telle yow how ye\nshull do.\"  Quod the mayden, \"Telle on, and I will do after\ntechynge.\"  Quod this othir, \"Ye shall abandon yow to alle men,\nand sey ye will no longer a-byde with youre suster, and thus\nshall ye haue all youre luste of youre body, ne neuer shul ye\nhere Iustice that will speke therof to let yow; and thus shall\nye be oute of all daunger, and euery worthy man will be glad to\nhaue you for youre grete herytage.\"  And the mayden graunted\nto do in this manere, and thus she departed from hire suster, and\nabandoned hire body to alle men, be the conseill of this olde\nwoman, where-of the devell was right gladde that he hadde\nbrought this a-bouten. And when the elder mayden sye that hir suster was thus gon,\nshe yede anoon to the holy man that hadde taught hir the\nright creaunce, full hevy and pensif, makynge grete doell and sorow;\nand when this godeman sye her so pensif he hadde grete pitee, and seyde to hir, \"Blesse the and comaunde the to god, for I se\nthe gretly affraied.\"  And she ansuerde, \"I have grete cause,\nfor I haue loste my suster, that is be-come a comyn woman.\"\nAnd when the gode man herde this he was gretly astonyd, and\nseide, \"The feende is full besy a-bowte yow, which will not\ncesse till he have disseyved the; but god be thyn helpe!\"\n\"A sir,\" quod she, \"how may I kepe me from his disceytis?\nfor ther is no thynge that I have so grete feire of, as that he\nsholde have ouer me eny power.\"  Quod the holy man, \"Yef\nthow wilte do after my counsell, he shall never disceyve the.\"\n\"Certeyn,\" quod she, \"I will gladly do your counsell.\"\n\"Than,\" quod he, \"belevest thow not in the fadir, sone, and holy\ngoste, and that these thre persones be oon god in trynite, and\nthat god com down in to erthe, and be-com man for the\nredempcion of mannes sowle, of hem that in hym stadfastly beleve, and\nkepe his comaundemente.\"  And she seide, \"Right as ye sey, I\nbeleve; and so, veryly, I pray to god be my socoure and helpe.\"\n\"Now than,\" quod he, \"I pray the, and comaunde that thow\nkepe the fro fallynge in to grete ire or wrath, for in that the\nfeende repaireth moste, bothe in man and woman, namly, when\nthey be in grete ire and comberaunce; that thow haste yelde the\nin the graces of oure lorde and alle seyntis; and at alle tymes\nthow goist to bedde, or arysist, blisse the in the name of the\nfader, sone, and holy goste, and make upon the in the name of\nthe crosse, on the which he suffred his passion to bye vs fro the\npeynes of helle.  And yef thow do thus, thow shalt have no\ndrede of the feendes power.  And where that thow slepest on\nnyght, loke that thow have lyght, ffor the deuell hatyth all\nclerenesse and lyght, and gladly will not com there.\" Thus taught the holy man the mayden, which hadde grete\ndrede of the deueles engynes; and so she returned hom\na-geyn to her house, full stabill in the feith, and full humble to god,\nand to the pore peple which comen vnto hir, and seiden, \"Trewly,\nit is no wonder though ye be gretely affraied of the turment, that\nis falle of youre fader, and of youre moder, and youre broder and\nsustres, that thus be myscheved; but now taketh gode counsell, and be of gode comfort, for ye ar right ryche, and have grete\nherytage; wherfore euery worthy man will be glad to have yow.\"\nAnd she ansuerde a-geyn, and seide, \"Oure lorde kepe me in his\nservyse, as he knoweth it is grete nede.\"  Thus endured she\nwele two yere, that the feende myght neuer be-gyle her, ne\nneuer myght make her do euell werke; and he sye wele, that he\nne cowde nat make her lese that the holy man hadde hir lerned,\nlesse than she were made wroth.  Than made he hir suster come\non a saterday, at even, to do hir more turment and anger, to loke\nyef he might gete hir in that manere.  And when hir suster com,\nit was fer with-ynne nyght; and she brought with her a grete\nhepe of harlotys.  And when she sye her suster so come she was\nangry, and seide vnto here, \"Ffeire suster,\" quod she, \"as longe\nas ye caste yow to lede soche lyf, ye ought not to come in this\nplace, for ye make me haue grete blame, wherof I have lityll\nnede.\"  And she ansuerde a-geyn, as a woman that the feende\nwas with-ynne, and seyde that she wolde yet do worse, and\nseide that she was more euell than she, and bar hir on-honde\nthat she loved the holy man paramours, and yef it were knowen\nthe trouth that she worthy to be distroid.  And when her\nsuster herde this, she griped hir be the shulders, and put hir owt\nat the dore; and the tother, to a-uenge hir, made the harlotys\nthat come with hir to kach her suster, and bete her right euell;\nso with grete peyne she aschaped fro them, and fledde in to her\nchamber, and shet her dore, and barred hit ffrom her, and the\nharlottis that were come with her.  And she a-bode in her\nchamber alone, and leyde her down on her bedde all clothed, and\nwepte tendirly for sorowe; and when the deuell sye that she was\nangry, and sole by her-self, and that it was derke, he was\ngladde.  And she remembred the myschef of hir fader and moder, and\nbrother and susters, and sore wepte when she hadde thought on\nall parteis; and so ther was grete sorowe and grete ire at hir\nherte.  And when the feende sye that she hadde foryete that the\nholy man hadde taught her, he thought that she stode owte of\ngoddes grace, and of her maister; \"and now might I well put\noure man in hir.\"  And this feende, that hadde power to make woman conceyve, was all redy, and lay by hir, while she was\nslepynge; and when she hadde concayved, she awaked, and in\nher wakyng, she thought on the holy man, and ther-with she\nblissed here, and seide, \"Seynt Mary, what is me be-falle, ffor I\nam disceyved sith I leyde me here.  Now, gracyouse lady, pray\nvnto thi dere sone that he haue mercy upon me, and diffende\nmy body fro turment of the enmy.\"  And than she aros, and\nsought aboute after hym that sholde haue don that dede, for she\nwende to haue founde hym thar-ynne, and she ran to the dore,\nand fonde it shet in the same maner as she had barred it her self,\nand than she sought ouer all in her chamber , but nought cowde\nshe fynde.  Than she demed that it was the enmy that so hadde\nher begiled, and than she made full grete sorowe, and cryde\nmoche vpon oure lorde, prayinge hym, that he wolde not suffer\nher to be shamed here in this w orlde .  And anoon as it was day,\nthe feende led a-way this othir suster, for she hadde fully espleyted\nhis purpos.  And when they were alle passed, she com owte of\nhir chamber sorowfull and pensif, and called after her seruaunt\nand a-noon sente after two women; and when they were come,\nanoon she wente to hir confessour.  And the gode man sye her\ncomynge, he seide, \"Thowe hest som grete nede, for I se the\ngretly affraied.\"  And she answerde, \"I ought wele to be\naffrayed, for it betyde to me that neuer fill to eny woman\nsaf oonly to me; and therfore I come to seche youre counseill,\nfor I haue herde yow saye, that ther was neuere creature that\ndede so grete offence that yef he were confessed and repentant,\nand that he wolde resceyve penance for his trespasse, that he\nsholde haue anoon foryevenesse.  Sir, I have synned, and wete\nye wele I am disceyved be the deuell.\" Than she tolde how\nhire suster com to hir howse, and all, gynnynge and ende as ye\nhaue herde, and how she fill on slepe on her bedde, and hir dore\nshette and barred, and how hir grete sorowe made hir for-yete\nto blisse hir; and, quod she, \"When I a-woke I fonde me\ndiffoulde, and my maidenhede loste.  Sir, I sought thourgh my chamber, and fonde my dor shet, ne I cowde fynde no lyvinge\ncreature, that eny suche thynge myght haue don to me; for in this wyse I have synned, wherfore I crye god mercy, and yow,\nand that I may have soche penance, that I lese not the lif\neverlastynge.\"  The holy man lestned well to all hir confession, but\nhe yaf no grete credence to that she seide, for he herde neuer\nbe-fore of no soche thynge; and therfore he seyde unto hir, quod\nhe, \"Thow art fulle of the deuell; how sholde I absoyle the, or\nenioyne the penance for thynges which I wene thou lyest veryly,\nfor never was ther woman that loste her maiden-hede, but she\nwiste by whom and how, or, at the leste, that she myght fele the\nman that dide the dede; and thow woldiste make me bileve this\nmerveyle, that thow seyest in this wyse is the be-falle.\"  And\nshe ansuerde, \"So, verily, god be my socoure in my moste nede\nas I have seide trouth.\"  The holy man seide, \"Yef it be so as\nthow haste seyde unto me, it shall verily be knowe both to the,\nand to me with-ynne shorte tyme.  Thow hast broken the\nobedyence that I comaunded the, therfore I charge the in penaunce\nthat alle the saterdayes while thou lyvest, that thow ete no mete\nbut ones on the day.  And as touchynge the lecherye that thow\nhast tolde, wher-of I can not leve the, thow oughtest to have\npenaunce all thy lyf-time, yef thow wil take soche as I shall the\nenioyne.\"  And she answerde, \"Ye can not charge me with\nnoon but I will gladly performe it.\"  Than seyde the holy man,\n\"Thou comest to have counseill of holy cherche, and to the\nmercy of oure lorde Jhesu Criste, that bought vs with his\nprecyouse blode, and with his bitter deth; and haste very\nrepentaunce of herte, like as thow seyest with thy mouth, and\nforsakeste all lechery and synne, saf oonly that fill in thi slepynge,\nfro the whiche no crature may kepe hym clene.\"  And she graunted\nhym, with that he wolde be hir plegge be-fore god that she sholde\nbe saued, and that she were not dampned for that synne. She toke hir penaunce soche as he enioyned her with gode\nwill, sore wepynge, as she that was very repentante; and\nthis gode man assoiled hir, and yaf hir his blissynge, and sette hir ageyn in the loue of god in his beste manere, and brought her to\nthe haly water, and made her to drynke in the name of the\nfader, sone, and holy goste, and caste of the same water vpon\nher, and badde hir to thynke wele on that he hadde charged her\nwith.  \"And alle tymes when thow haste eny nede, come to me\nageyn.\"  And than he be-taught hir to god; and so he put in\nher penaunce, alle her gode dedes and almesse and prayers that\nshe sholde do.  And so returned this damsell in to her howse, and\nledde full holy lyf.  And when the deuell sye that he hadde\nloste her in soche manere, that he wiste not what she dede, ne\nwhat she seyde, he was wroth and angry.  Thus longe she abode\nthat the seed myght no lenger ben hid whiche she hadde in hir\nbody, so that her wombe gan to waxen grete, that the peple\naperceyved wele that she was with chylde, and they that were\nhyr frendes, and axeden hir, be whom it was; and she\nansuerde, so god be hir helpe, she wiste not be whom it\nwas.  Quod they, \"How may this be; have ye than hadde so many\nmen, that ye knowe not who is the fader?\"  And she ansuerde,\n\"Gode lete me haue delyueraunce yef euer man, my witynge,\nhadde to do with me in soche maner.\"  And they that this\nherden blessed them for merveyle, and seyde that it myght\nneuer be so, neythir of hir, ne of noon other, \"but that ye hope\nto excuse hym so, that hath don the dede; but truly great pite it\nis of you, for as soone as the Iuges knowe ther-of, ye moste be\ndeed.\"  When she herde this she was sore abaisshed, and seyde,\n\"So veryly god make my soule safe, as I sawe hym neuer that\nhath don me this, ne never I hym knewe.\"  And the womene\nthat her herde speke, helde her for a foole and vn-trewe, and\nclatered it aboute, and seyden certeynly that hir lewte was foule\nspente, seth it was loste in soche manere.\"  And when she herde\nthis she remembred on hir confessour, and com to hym, and tolde\nas the wymen hadden seide.  The gode man sye that she was\ngrete with quyk childe, and merveiled gretly, and axed hir yef\nshe hadde wele holden hir penaunce.  \"Sir,\" quod she, \"ye,\nwith-oute fayle.\"  Quod he, \"Be-fill yowe neuer this merveyle\nsaf ones?\"  \"Certes, sir,\" quod she, \"neuer be-fore ne after.\" And when the gode man herde this he merveyled\nstrongeleche, and sette the oure and the nyght in writynge,\nlike as she hadde tolde hym, and seide, \"Be ye right syker, when\nthis chelde shalbe borne, I shall well knowe yef ye have made\neny gabbynge, and I have very trust in god, that yef it be as ye\nhave seide, ye shall not be deed ther-fore; but ye may wele haue\ngrete feer, for as soone as the Iuges knowe ther-of, they well\nmake yow to be take for couetyse of youre londes and herytage,\nand do Iustice vpon yow; but when ye be taken, sende me worde,\nand I shall come to helpe yow, and comforte in all that I may,\nand wite well that god shall helpe yow, yef ye be soche as ye\nsey.\"  And than he seide, \"Goth hom to youre howse, and have\nno drede; and, loke ye, be of gode counfort and good lyvynge,\nfor that ledith mane and woman to gode endynge.\"  And so she\ndeparted and come to hir owne house, and ledde holyly hir lif,\ntil the Iuges made hir to be taken, and brought hir be-fore\nthem.  And anon The word is written \"a non&omacr;.\" as she was a-rested, she lete sende after the gode\nermyte, that hadde alwey ben her counfort, and he cam in all the\nhaste that he myght; and when he was comene he fonde that the\nIuges hedde brought hir by-fore them.  The Iustyces clepid hym\nto hem, and tolde hym the ansuere that she hadde seide hem, she\nhadde never knowynge of mannes company; \"and trowe ye,\"\nquod thei, \"that eny woman my&yogh;ht haue childe with-oute\nmannes company.\"  The gode man ansuerid and seide, I shell\nnot sey all that I thynke, but thus moche I sey vnto yow: yef\nye will do my counsell, ye shall not put hir to Iugement while\nshe is with childe, till that she be deliuerd, for the childe hath\nno deth deserved.\"  The Iuges seiden, \"We shall do as ye\ncounsele.\"  Quod the holy ermyte, \"Yef ye do by my counsele\nye shall put hir in a stronge tour in gode warde, wher she shall\nhaue no power ouer hir-self; and with hir ye shall put two\nwomen ffor to helpe hir at hir delyueraunce when tyme is, in\nsoche maner that thei may not com oute no more.  And thus\nshell she be lefte tell she haue chelde, and lete hir aftar be kepte tyll she be stronge to goo by her-self.  And then yef ye se none\nother thyng be her then ye se now, than do the Iustice as ye\nseme right.  Thus shall ye do now be my rede; and yef ye do\nothirwise I may no more.\"  And even as the gode man deuised,\nthey dede.  And so she was shet in a stronge tour, and with her\ntwo women, the wiseste that they knewe of soche mystere, and\nmade hem a wyndowe to hale vpe, that hem ow&yogh;ht to\nhave. When this was don the gode man spake to hem be-nethe on the\ngrounde with-oute, and seyde to the damesell, \"When thow haste\nchilde,\" quod he, \"make it to be baptiseth as soone as thow\nmayste; and when thow shalte be brought oute ageyn to\nIugement lete me have wetynge.\"  In this wyse abode they stille in\nthe tour a grete while, til that she was delyuered of a sone, as\ngod wolde.  And when he was born it hadde the engyne and the\nwitt of a feende, after the kynde of hym that be-gate hym.  But\nthe deuell wrought so folily, that oure lorde toke it to his owne\nvse, be the very repentance of the modir, that hir put in the\nmercy and ordenaunce of god and holicherche, and hilde wele the\ndoctryne of his mynystres; and, therfore oure lorde wolde not\nlese that shulde be his.  And ther the deuell was disseyued of\nhis purpos, that he hadde ordeyned that childe to haue his arte\nand witte to knowe alle thynges don, and seide, bothe that were\npaste and that were to come.  And oure lorde, that alle thynges\nknoweth, sye the repentaunce of the moder, and that it was not\nher will that was so be-fellen, he wolde have hym on his parte;\nneuertheles, he yaf hym fre choys to do what he wolde, for yef\nhe wolde he myght yelde god his parte, en to the feende his also. This was this childe born, of whom the wemen were sore\nafeerde, for they sye hym more roughe than other childeren\nthat they had seyne, and so they shewed to the moder, and when\nshe it sough, she fayned her, and sayd, \"This childe maketh\nme to haue grete feer.\"  Quod the wemen, \"So doth it to vs.\"\nQuoth the moder, \"Lete it be let don owte at the wyndowe that\nit may be baptysed,\" and they dyd soo.  \"What shalbe his name?\"  \"I will,\" quod she, \"that it haue name after my\nfader.\"  Then they let it down by a corde owte at the wyndowe\nof the tour, and cherged hem that weren be-nethe, that it shulde\nbe baptysed, and named after the gode man that was fader of the\nmodre, and so it was cristened Merlyn, and was delyuered to the women vpe to the wyndowe to the moder, and ther was\nnone othir women that durste norishe it but the modre, for it\nwas so grysly to syght, and therfore was the moder suffred to\nnorishe it tell it was x monthes of age, and than it semed\nij yere age or more; and whan it was xij monthes of age, the\nwomen seide to the modre, \"Dame, we will no lengar be here in\nthis case from oure frendes; we will gone owte, for we have be\nhere longe tyme.\"  Then quod she, \"As sone as ye departe from\nhens shall I be brought to Iugement.\"  Quod they, \"We may\nno more be here-ynne, and therefor we ne may no more do\ntherto.\"  Then she wepte and cryde hem mercy, praynge hem\nto abyde a while, and they graunted hir; and as they lened\nlokynge oute at the wyndowe ther as she satte sore wepynge,\ntoke the child in her armes, sayinge, \"Feyre sone, for youre\nsake shall I suffir the deth, and I haue it not deserued, for ther\nis noon, saf oonly God, that knowith the trowthe, and I may not\nbe byleved, wherfore I most with grete wronge be put to deth.\"\nAnd as she made this lamentacion, the chede gan to be-holde hir,\nand seyde, \"Moder,\" quod he, \"be not dismayed, for ye shull\nneuer be Iuged to deth for my cause.\"  And when the moder\nherde this ansuere she aferid, that as she sodenly made a sprynge,\nthe childe fill oute of hire arme and cryde.  The wemen that\nwere at the wyndowe wenden that she hadde ben a-boute to kylle\nthe childe, and sodeynly axed hir, \"Whi made the childe this\nshrike? wilt thow sleue it?\"  And she ansuerde, \"I thought it\nneuer, but it was for a merveyle that it seide vnto me.\"  Quod\nshe, \"It seyde I sholde neuer be deed for hym.\"  Than, quod\nthei, \"We shull heire hym sey othir thynges.\"  Than they toke the childe and cherishid it, prayinge to speke to hem; but for\nought thei cowde do thei myght gete of hym no mo wordes,\ntill on a tyme the modir seyde to the wemen, quod she, \"Manace\nme, and sey I shalbe brente,\" for fayne wolde she that the wemen\nherde it speke  The wemen seyde to the moder, \"Truly it is\ngrete damage and pite that youre fayre body shalbe brent for so\nfoule a creature; better it were that he hadde neuer be borne.\"\n\"Certes,\" quod he, \"falsly lyen, and that hath my moder made\nyow to sey.\"  And when they herde this they were sore abaisshed,\nand seiden, \"Certes, this is no childe, but it is a deuell, who\nmyght this have knowen that he hath seide.\"  Than they axed\nhym many demaundes, but he wolde speke no more, saf he seide,\n\"Let me be, and beth in pes, for ye ben more synfull than is my\nmoder.\"  And when they hadde herde this they hadden grete\nmerveyle, and seide, \"This may not be kepte counseill, ne it\nought not not to be, and ther-fore we will telle it to the peple\nbe-nethe with-oute forth.\"  Tho wente they to the wyndowe and\nclepeden to the peple, and tolde them this merveyle of the childe,\nIn so moche that these tydinges com to the Iuges, and thei hadde\nther-of grete merveile, and seide it was tyme to do Iustice vpon\nthe moder.  Thei sente to the baile that with-ynne xl dayes she\nsholde be brought be-fore them to have her Iugement.  When\nthe moder of Merlin knewe that hir daye was come she hadde\ngrete feer, and sent worde to the gode hermyte, hir confessour. Thus she abode viij dayes or more, till the tyme com that she\nsholde be brent.  Whan she remembred hir on hir deth she\nmade grete lamentacion for grete drede.  The childe wente\na-boute in the tour and sye his moder wepynge, and he lowgh\nand was mery.  The wemen that this be-heilde seide, \"Thow\nthynkest full lityll on thi moders grete sorowe, that this weke\nfor the shall be brente.\"  To this worde ansuerde the childe,\n\"Feire moder, be not afeirde, for while I leue shall noon be so\nhardy to putt yow to deth, saf oonly god that is Almyghty.\"\nWhen the wemen herde this they seiden, \"This childe shall ben\na wise man and a wonderfull.\"  And when the day com that\nwas sette, the wemen were taken oute of the tour, and she bar hir sone in hir armes.  The Iuges were come, and toke the two\nwomen in counseill, and axed yef it were trewe that the childe\nhadde seyde soche wordes; and they seiden like as they hadden\nherde.  And the Iuges seiden he moste be connynge of moche\nthynge, yef he shulde saue his moder; and the gode hermyte was\ncome to conforte the moder; and oone of Iuges seide to hir,\n\"Dame, make yow redy, for ye moste suffir this martire of deth.\"\nAnd she ansuerde prayinge she myght speke with hir confessour;\nand they yaf hir lycence.  And they entred in to a chamber and\nlefte hir childe with-oute, and the peple a-resoned it with many\nquestyons, but he yaf noon ansuere. The moder spake with hir\nconfessour, pitofly wepynge; and when she hadde seyde all that\nshe wolde the gode man axed yef hir childe spake, and she\nseide, \"Ye.\"  \"Certes,\" quod the gode man, \"therof shall\ncome merveiles.\"  Than thei come oute be-fore the Iuges; the\ndamsell was in hir smok, with a mantill a-bouten hir, and fonde\nhir son with-oute the chamber, and toke hym in her armes, and\nstode still.  And the Iuges examyned hyr who was the fader of\nthe childe; and she ansuerde, \"I knowe well I go to my deth,\nand so god have mercy and pyte on my soule, as I never knewe\nthe fader, ne neuer hym saugh, ne neuer erthely man hadde I of\nknowleche, wherthourgh I sholde have childe.\"  The Iuges seide,\n\"We may neuere bileve that this be trewe that thow seiste.\"\nThan the Iuges drough hem apart, and cleped these other wemen,\nand seide, \"Dames, be-fill it euer to yow, or to eny othir woman\nthat ye herde of speke, that myght have childe with-owte carnall\nknowynge of man.\"  And those seyde, \"With-oute manes feliship\nmyght no woman have chylde.\"  Than the Iuge turned to this\ndamesell, and tolde how those wemen hadde seide, \"and,\ntherfore, it is grete reson that we do Iustice vpon yow.\"  Then\nMerlyn sprong oute of his mothers arm angrye, and saide to the Iuge, \"It is no right that she be deed, for she hath it not\ndeserued; and yf other shulde be don Iustice vpon all tho that don\navouterye be-syde ther housbands, many there were werthy to be brent.  And as touchynge this that is putte on my moder, she is\nnothynge gilty; reinde of that gode man yef ye charge hym to say\nthe trouthe.\"  Then the Iuges examyned the gode hermyte yef\nit were so, and he seide, \"Ye,\" as by his wetynge, and he told\nhem how she was begiled in her slepe, and that she neuer sedd\nhym that dide the deed, \"ne I never hym sygh, wherfore al that\naperteyneth to god I take vpon me for hir; nevertheles, I herde\nnever of no soche merveyle, safe only of this.\"  Than seide the\nchild, \"Ye have the houre and the tyme writen that I was\nynne conceyved, and ther-by may you knowe yef my mother sey\ntroath.\"  The gode man ansuerde, \"Thow seist soth, ne I wot\nnot how thow myght knowe this.\"  Than were the women cleped\nwhich tolde the hour of the childes berthe, and so was the gode\nmannes writyng fonde trewe; and the Iuge seide, \"For al that she\nsholde not go quyte.\" Thane wrathed the childe, and saide, \"I know better my\nfader than thov doste thyne, and thy moder wiste beter\nwhom is thy fader, than my moder knoheth mynne.\"  Thane\nwrathed the Iuge, and seide, \"Yef thow censt ought say of my\nmoder, sey on.\"  Quoth the child, \"I cowde sey so moche be\nthy moder, that she hath beter deserved the deth then hath my\nmoder, therfore yef that thove me; leet my moder be in pese that\nnatht knoweth of that thow puttest on hir in thy Inngendure.\"\nTho gan the Iuge to be right wrath, and seyd, \"Yef thow canste\ndo so, then haste reserwed thy moder fro brennynge; but, wyt\nthow well, yef thow canste not prewe this vpon hir, I shall\nbrenne bothe the and thy moder to-gedere.\"  \"That shall neuer\nbe while I lyfe,\" quoth Merlyn, \"that thow shall have no\npowre overene my moder.\"  This was Merlynes pletere for his\nmoder. Tho was respite take to the ve day, and the Iuge lete sende\nafter his moder; and of many folke was the childe\naresonde of diuirse thynge, and of his moder also; but in alle the\nv. dayes myght ne creature gete of no worde.  And when the\nIuges moder was come, Merlyn and his moder were brought owte\nof prison, and ledde be-fore peple.  Tho seide the Iuge to Merlyn, \"Lo, here is my moder on whom thow most sey that\nthat thow hast promysed.\"  Tho ansuerde, \"Thow art not so\nwyse as thow weneste; go, brynge thy moder in to a prevy\nchamber, and take with yow of youre frendes that ye beste\ntruste.

And Merlyn axed alle the peple, \"Yef\nI delyuer my moder fro this Iuge, shall eny other do her\nduresse?\"  And they seiden all, \"Nay.\"  When they weren in\nthe chamber the Iuge axed of Merlyn, \"Now sey of my moder\nthat thow owest to sey, wherby thy moder may be quyte.\"  The\nchylde ansuerde, \"I shall neuer sey thynge of thy moder\nwherefore my moder ought to be quyte, for she hath no thynge\naguylte, ne I will in no maner diffende my moder a-geyn right;\nbut I will saue goddis right and hirs; and yef thow do wisely\nlete my moder be in pees, and reste with-oute more, and I shall\nlete youres.\"  \"So shalte thow nought escape,\" quod the\nIuge.

This Constance regned a grete tyme,\nand hadde thre sones, the first hight Moyne, and the other\nPendragon, and the thirde Vter.  This Constans hadde a man in his\nrealme that hight Vortiger; this Vortiger was a worldly wise\nman, and Constance was a man of grete age, and ended his\nlif.  Tho the pepill axed who sholde be her kynge and here lorde;\nthey acorded to make Moyne kynge, that was eldest, for it was not\nright that noon other sholde be by-fore hym.  Heir-to accorded\nVortiger hym-self, and the barons chosen Vortiger to be\nstwarde.  And the hethen peple that werreden on the kynge Moyne often\nsithes foughten withe the crystene.  And Vortiger dide with all\nthe realme his wille, that the kynge that was yonge ne hadde but\nthe krowne.  So hadde Vortiger the hertys of the peple, and he\nknewe well that thei heilde hym worthy and wise, and lyfte hym\nto grete pride, for he sye ther was noon in the londe that myght\ndo so moche as he.  The hethen assembled a grete oste vpon\nhem, and the kynge com to Vortiger, and seide, \"Gode frende,\nhelpe to diffende the lande, for I and alle the peple be at thy\ncomaundement.\"  And Vortiger seyde, \"Sir, ther is moche\npeple in youre londe that me haten, therfore lete them helpe yow,\nfor I will not entermete me ther-of. When the kynge and thise other sye that ther was noon helpe\nin hym, ne socour, they returned, and arayed hem, and\nmade hem redy to fyght, but they were disconfited of the hethen\npeple; and than they returned, and complayned here grete losse,\nand seyden yef Vortiger hadde be ther, they hadde not so\nmyshapped.  So be-gan the peple to hate the kynge.  Thus it indured\nlonge tyme, tyll that the kynge was holden a cowarde; and alle\nthe barons seiden thei wolde no longer suffer hym to be\nkynge.  Than come they to Vortiger, and seide, \"Sir, we ben kyngeles,\nfor he that we have is nought worth; for goddes sake take\nit upon yow, and mayntene vs, for ther is noon in this londe\nthat may so well as ye.\"  And he ansuerde, \"I may not, ne I\nought not to do while the kynge leveth.\"  \"Truly,\" quod they,\n\"better it were for vs that he were ded that a-lyve.\"  \"Yef he\nwere ded,\" quod Vortiger, \"than yef ye and other wolde assent, I wolde be youre kynge.\"  When thei herde these words,\nsupposed wele what he ment.  Thei toke leve of hym, and yede in\nto their contreyes, and tolde their frendes the ansuere of Vortiger,\nand thei seide, \"It were beste for vs to sle hym, and than may\nVortiger knowe that he is kynge thourgh oure helpe, be that we\nhave slayn the kynge; and so shall he euer after do oure wille,\nand be oure frende.  And so xij made hem redy, and wente in to\nthe halle ther the kynge was, and ran on hym with swerdes and\nknyves, and slowe hym.  And thei fonde but ffewe that a-geyn\nhem seide to make resistence.  Tho they com to Vortiger, and\nseiden, \"Now shalt thow be kynge, for we have slayn kynge\nMoyne.\"  When Vortiger wiste he was ded, he made semblaunt\nas he hadde be right wroth, and seide, \"Full euell have ye\nsped that thus have slayn youre kynge.  I rede you to fle out of\nthe londe for drede of the kynges peple, and me forthynketh that\nye be hider i-come.\"  And thei anoon departed thens, and thus was\nkynge Moyn slayn.  After, the peple of the Contre assembleden,\nand speken of Vortiger; and so thei acorded to haue Vortiger\nkynge.  At this counseill were two noble men that kepten the\ntwo childeren which were bretheren to kynge Moyn, that was\nPendragon and Vter. When these tow gode men wisten that Vortiger sholde be\nkynge, thei denied wele that thourgh hym was kynge\nMoyn slayne, thei toke consell be-twene hem bothe, and seide,\n\"Sithe that Vortiger hath do sle oure kynge, lete vs now\nkepe the two children, for we loued moche the fader, that to\nvs did many benefetes, and be hym haue we yet all that\nwe haue.  Gretly were we to blame yef we loste that we\nhaue so longe kepte.  Than the two gode men acorded that\nthey wolde fle in to a straunge contre towarde Gawle, and\nlede with hem the two children that they hadde so longe tyme\nkepte.  But at this tyme I will not sey where thei be come\ntill tyme of the tale come ther-to; but thus moche I sey yow,\nthat in a Citee that is called Ben-oyc, The MS. scratched here. that now is cleped Bourges, were thei longe tyme norished.  And so may ye\nvnderstande be this tale that he ought doth for a gode man,\nlesith not his traueyle. When Vortiger was chosen to be kynge, and he was sacred,\nand lorde of londe, thei that hadde slayn the kynge\nMoyne come be-fore hym.  And when he hem saugh, he made\nsemblaunt as he hadde neuer seye them be-fore.  And thei\nreproved hym of vnkyndenesse, and seyde thourgh them he was\nchosen to be kynge, for his love hadde thei slayn kynge\nMoyn.  When Vortiger herde hem seye thei hadde slayn their lorde, he\ncomaunded to take them; and seide, \"Ye have Iuged youre-self\nthat knowliche that ye have youre lorde slayn.  In the self\nmanere sholde ye do to me yef ye myght; but I shall make yow\nwell to be kepte.\"  And when thei vndirstode this, they were\nsore abasshed, and seiden, \"Sir, we trowed to deserue of yow\nthanke.\"  Than Vortiger made hem to be bounde to horse tailes,\nand made hem to be rente and drawen a-sonder, alle xij, while\neny hym wolde holde with other.  Thise that thus were\ndistrowed were come of grete lynage; they come to Vortiger, and\nseide, \"Thow hast don vs grete shame, that haste putte oure\nfrendes to so vileyns deth; we will never gladly do the servise.\"\nWhen Vortiger herde their manasynge, he was wroth and angry,\nand seide yef they spake eny more ther-of he sholde do the same\nwith hem.  And they hadde grete dispite of that worde, and\nansuerde as thei that litlll him douted.  \"Thow manesest vs as\nthow wilte, but while we have eny londe, or kyn, or frendes,\nshalt thow neuer be with-oute werre; for thow art not oure lorde\nbe right, ne the londe is not thyn, but that thow haste a-geyn all\nreson; and wite \u00feou wele that thow shalt dye the same deth\nthat thow hast made hem.\"  And thus they departed with-oute\nmore at that tyme.  In this manere be-gan the euelwill be-twene\nthe kynge and the barons, so that thei assembled grete pepill\nvpon the kynge, and did hym grete harme, and token often\nprisoners, and many other prayes upon hym.  In this maner\nhadde Vortiger werre longe tyme, and often tyme faught so with\nthem that he drof hem oute of hys londe. And when he hadde dryuen hem oeut, he be-come so crewell to\nhis peple that thei myght no lenger hym suffer, but a-roos\na-geyn hym, and refte hym grete part of his londe, and stuffed\ntheir forteresses.  When Vortiger sye that, he was ferde to lese his\nlonde.  Than he sente Messages to the Danes that were hethen peple,\nand seide he wolde have pees with hem.  When thei wiste that\nVortiger disered the pees, they were gladde.  Than com Angier\nto Vortiger, and serued hym trewly till he hadde made ende of\nhis werre.  Than Angiers spake so with Vortiger, that he toke\noone of Angiers doughters to his wyf.  Wher-thourgh the peple\nseyde he loste grete parte of beleve for his wif that was not\ncrysten.  After all this Vortiger knewe wele that he hadde not\nthe hertys of the peple; and also the sones of Constance were\nfledde in to straunge londes, and that thei wolde repeire as sone\nas thei myght; and knewe well also yef they come a-geyn it\nsholde be to hym grete damage; and therfore he thought to\nmake a Castell so stronge and so large, that he sholde not drede\nno werre.  Tho lete he sende after alle the masons and\nwerkemen of his londe, and comaunded hem to make a tour, the\nstrengest that myght be devised in eny maner, and than did to\nbrynge ston and morter, and be-gan the werke.  And when thei\nhadde wrought a iiij fadome of height, than it ouerthrewe, and\nthe mountayne that the werke was sette on gan to tremble, that\nthei semed it wolde synke.  And he seide for that wolde he not\nyet cesse, but make it vp a-geyn.  Thus thei wrought dyuerse\ntymes, and euer it fill and trymbled.  When Vortiger sye his\nwerke myght not holde, he seide he sholde neuer have ioye till\nhe myght knowe what was the cause that it fill.  Than he sente\nafter alle the wisest men of his londe.  And when thei were\ncome he tolde hem the merveyle of his toure, and axed theyre\ncounseile.  And thei seide ther myght noon knowe the cause\nwhy, but it were notable clerkes; \"ffor thei can knowe many\nthinges be force of clergie that we ne can no skyle on.\"  Than\nseide Vortiger, \"Me thinke ye sey soth.\"  He lete sende after\nalle the wise clerkes of his londe, and tolde hem how his toure\nfill, wher-of they gretly merveiled.  Than he toke oon of the wisest of hem, and axed hym yef he trowed they cowde telle\nwhy his werke myght not stonde. Between the words stonde and Do are two marks, apparently to fill up the space of the line. \"Do me to wete that ye can\ntelle the cause why?\"  And when thei herden this, they seide,\n\"Sir, we witeth not; but ther be somme that myght wele knowe\nby astronomye.\"  \"Than,\" quod he, \" enquereth a-monge you\nwho will take the labour to serche oute the cause why, and lete me\nwite.\"  Than enquered oon of a-nother yef ther were eny that\ncowde of that art.  So ther were two that seide thei cowde\ni-nough as hem semed.  Thise tweyne chosen to hem of hir othir\nfelischep, that thei were vij in nombre.  And they were brought\nbe-fore the kynge, and he axed, \"Shull ye tell me thencheson\nthat my werke may not stonde, yef it may well be knowen by\neny man?\"  Quod they, \"We shall knewe it.\"  And the\nkynge seyde he wolde yeve them what they wolde\ndesire.  Thus departed the counsell of the clerkes; and the vij a-biden\nstille, that gretely payned hem to knowe how that toure myght\nholde.  Gretly stodied euery clerke be hym-self, but for all their\nlabour thei cowde not fynde but oon thynge, and that thynge ne\nheilde of nought as to the toure; till that the kynge comaunded\nhem to sey that they hadde take in charge.  \"Sir,\" quod thei,\n\"that ye vs axen is a grete thynge.  We moste yet haue viij\ndayes of respyte.\"  Quod the kynge, \"I will well that ye have so\nlonge terme; and be well ware that than ye sey me the trowthe.\"\nThan wente the clerkes to counsell, and seide oon to anothir,\n\"What seme ye of this thynge that the kynge vs demaundeth.\"\nQuod oon of hem, \"Will ye do well? lete eche man by\nhym-self telle me what hym semeth in this mater.\"  Ther-to they\naccorded; than thei drowgh a-syde eche be hym-self; but thei\nseiden of the tour they ne knewe nought, saf they sye a grete\nmerveyle, for thei saugh a childe of vij yere age, that was born\nwithouten fader erthly; and thus seide eche of hem.  Than seide this\nother, \"Cometh ageyn to-morowe alle to-geder.\" On the morowe, when thei were alle come be-fore hym, he\nseide,  \"Ye have alle seide to me oon thynge.  Ye seyen alle that ye come nought se touchynge the tour, but ye syen a childe\nof vij yere age, born with-oute erthely fader.  Ye seiden to me\nno more, and ther is noon that ne seeth, that by that same childe\nwe shull alle be distroyed; and this have ye alle fro me\nconseled.  Now,\" quod he, \"yef ye will leve me, ye shal warant youre\nowen lyves, and I will telle how we shull acorde alle to oon tale,\nand seyn alle that this tour may not holde, but yef in the\nfoundacion be put the blode of this childe, and than the tour shall\nstonde.  And thus lete eayche of vs sey by hym-self, so that the\nkynge ne a-parceyve not; but let vs diffende the kynge, that he\nse hym not quyk, but thei that shull go to seche hym brynge his\nblode.  Thus may we kepe vs from him be whom we se that we\nshull alle dye.\"  Thus ended their counseill; and come be-fore\nthe kynge, and seide that thei wolde not sey openly, but eche by\nhym-self in counsell, \"and so shull ye wite who seide beste\nreson, and that the oon sholde not knowe the counsell of his\nfelowe.\"  And so the kynge examyned eche by hym-self.  When\nthe kynge and his counseill herde this merveile, thei seiden it\nmyght welbe yef they myght fynde a childe born that hadde no\nfader, \"ye have eche of yow tolde me oon tale.\"  \"Sir,\" quod\nthei, \"yef it be not thus, doth with vs youre volente.\"  Than\nseide the kynge that he wolde have hem well kepte till he knew\nthe trouthe.  And thei seide, \"Sir, ne speketh nought with the\nchilde, but comaunde as soone as he is founden that he be slayn,\nand that the bloode be brought to yow.\"  The kynge made hem\nalle be shett in a stronge house, and made delyuere that hem\nneded; and cleped certeyn gentilmen, and made hem to be\nsworne to do truly his massage, and comaunded hem to seche after\na childe of the age of vij yere, whiche was born with-owte fader\nerthely.  Of these gentilmen were xij; and also the kynge dide\nhem to swere that whiche of hem sonneste myght fynde this\nchilde, a-noon with-oute tariynge he sholde it sle, and brynge\nthe blode of the chylde vn-to the kynge, and that thei sholde not\nreturne with-inne two yere, lesse than thei myght fynde the\nseide childe.  Thus the kynge lete seche this childe.  The\nmessagers departeden two and two to-geder, and passed thourgh many londes and contres in to a tyme that iiij of hem sodeynly\nmetten to-geder. Thus thei reden in oon company, alle iiij, till on a day that\nthei passeden thourgh a feelde be-side a town where-in\nwere grete plente of children, that ther-in were pleyinge.  And\nMerlyn, that knewe well that these iiij com to inquere after hym,\ndrough hym towarde oon of the richest of the company, for that\nhe wiste hym moste fell and hasty.  He hente his staf, and  yaf\nthis childe a grete buffet.  And a-noon this othir be-gan to crye\nand wape, and to myssey Merlyn, and reproved hym with a lowde\nvoyce, and cleped hym \"mys-begeten wreache and faderles.\"\nWhen these messagers herden this, thei com toward the childe\nthat was wepynge, and axed hym whiche was he that hadde\nsmyten hym.  And he hem ansuerde, \"It is the sone of a\nwoman whiche never knewe who hym be-gat, ne never man\ncowde telle of his fader.  And when Merlyn herde this, he com\na-geyn them laughinge, and seide, \"I am he that ye seche, and\nhe that ye be sworn ye sholden sle, and brynge my blode to\nkynge Vortiger.\"  And thei herden hym thus sey, thei were sore\na-merveyled, and axeden hym, \"Who hath tolde the this?\"\nQuod he, \"I wiste it er ye were sworn.\"  Quod thei, \"Than\nmoste thow come with vs.\"  \"Nay,\" quod he, \"I doute that ye\nwill me sle.\"  And yet he knewe well that thei hadde ther-to no\ntalant, but he seide that for to prove hem better.  Quod Merlyn,\n\"Yef ye will graunte me that ye shull not do me disese, I will\ngo with yow, and also telle why the tour may not stonde.\"  And\nwhen thei herde that, thei were more a-baissed than\nbe-fore.  \"Truly,\" quod thei, \"this childe is merveilouse, and grete pite\nit were hym to sle.\"  And eche of hem seyde that hem were\nbetter to be forsworn than to sle this childe.  Than said Merlyn,\n\"Ye shull come herberewe ther as is my moder, for I may not\ngo with yow with-oute takynge leve of here, and also of a gode\nman which is in the same place.\"  Thei seide, \"We will go where\nthat thow wilte.\" Thus brought merlyn the messagers of the\nkynge to his moder place, and when Merlyn come in to the house\nhe comaunded that thei sholde have gode chere.  When thei were alyght, he brought hem be-fore blase, and seide, \"Se hem here\nthat I tolde sholde come to seche me to sle,\" and seide to them,\n\"I pray yow that ye sey the trouthe be-fore this gode man,\nwhy that ye beth sente, and wite ye well yef ye gabbe\nenythynge, I know it wele i-nough.\"  And thei ansuerde, \"We\nwill no lesynge make.\"  Quod merlin to Blase, \"Maister,\nvnderstonde well what thei sey.\"  Quod the massanger, \"We be with\nkynge Vortiger, whiche hath be-gonne to make a stronge toure;\nand when the werke of this tour is iij or iiij fadom of\nheight, it may not holde, but synketh in an hour all that\nis wrought in iij monthis.  Wherefore the kynge is angry\nand wroth, and he dide sende after clerkes to knowe the\ncause that his werke may not holde.\"  \"Ye,\" quod Merlin,\n\"but noon of the clerkes ne cowde se the cause that letted\nthe werke to holde; but thei sien how I was born, and how\nthat I myght hem distroie, and so thei dide acorde that I\nsholde be slayn, and seide that the kynges werke sholde\nstonde, yef he myght have the blode of the childe born\nwith-oute fader.  And when Vortiger herde this, he heilde this a\ngrete merveile, and trowed that that the clerkes seiden\ntrewe.  And the clerkes charged the kynge that in no manere he sholde\nnot se me a-lyve; but as sone as I were founde, that I sholde\nwith-oute respite be slain, and my blode to be brought to be\nputte with the morter in the foundement of the tour, and by\nthat thei seiden it sholde holde.  Vortiger, by their techynge,\ntoke xij messagers, and made alle xij to swere that thei sholde me\nsle, and bringe with hem my blode; and of these xij be heer iiij\nwhiche, when ye were met, passeden thourgh the feild where\nchildern were bourdinge, and I, that knewe ye come me for to\nseche, smote oon of my felowes, for I wiste well he wolde sey of\nme the werste that he knewe in his anger, and ther-fore I it\ndide, that this gode man shulde fynde me trewe of that I hadde\nseide.\"  \"Now, maister,\" quod merlin to blase, \"axe hem yef\nit be so as I sey.\"  \"Truly,\" seide blase, \"it were grete pite\nhym to sle, for yef he lyve he shalbe right wise.\"  \"Certes,\"\nseide euereche of the messagers, \"I hadde leuer be disherited than he hadde resceyved deth thourgh me, and he hym-slef seth\nthat he knoweth all thynge, wote yef ther-to we have talent\nor noon.\" Than thei cleped in a-geyn merlyn, that was gon oute at\ndore; and Blase seide to hym how thei badde hym axe\nyef he wiste that thei hadden talent hym to sle.  And merlyn\nlowgh, and seide, \"I wote well now thei be nothynge in will\nther-to.\"  Quod thei, \"Wilt thow go with vs;\" and merlin\nseide, \"Ye, with gode will, yef ye will promyse me truly to\nbrynge me be-fore the kynge, and that ye ne suffer noon other to\ndo me harme ne disese, er I have with hym spoken.\"  And thei\nhym graunted.  Than seide Blase, \"I se well that thow wilt\nnow leve me: what wilt thow that I shall do of this werke that\nI haue be-gonne?\"  \"That shall I telle the,\" quod merlin;\n\"thow woste well that oure lorde hath yove me so moche witte\nand memorye, that he that wende to be siker of me, hath failed\nof his purpos, and I moste go in to that contre ffro whiche\nthese be come to fecche me.  And ther shall I be the beste\nbeleved man that euer was, sef all only god that is Almyghty;\nand thow shalt come thider, to make an ende of the werke.  But\nthow ne shalt not come with me, but by thy self, and axe after a\nlonde that is cleped Northumbirlonde.  And that contre is full of\ngrete foreste, and full wylde to them of the selue contre.  Ther\nthow shalt a-bide, and I shall come to the, and telle the all the\nmater that longeth to thi werke.  And moche is thy trauayle,\nand thow shalt have gode leyser, and as longe as the worlde\ndureth shall thi boke gladly ben herde.  And wite thow well\nthat my grete traueill shall not be by-fore this kynges\ncourte.  This kynge, to whom all my grete traueill shall be, and the\ntraueile of grete Breteyne, his name shalbe Arthur.  Thow shalt\ngo thider, as I have told the, and I shall often come to the, and\nbrynge soche tidinges as thow shalt put in this boke.  And wite\nit well, peple shulbe glad euer to heiren it; for shul but fewe\nthinges be don but in no place, but ther in shalbe a partye.  And\nthi boke shalbe cleped while the worlde endureth, the boke of the\nseynt Graal.\"  Thus spake merlyn with his maister, and taught hym how he sholde do.  He yeleped hym maister, for that he\nwas maister to his moder.  When the gode man herde merlin\nthus speke, he was glad, and seide, \"What thow wilte comaunde\nme I am redy to do it.\" Thus Merlyn made hym redy to go, and seide to the\nmessengers, I will go take leve of my moder.  Tho he brought\nhem ther as was his moder, and seide, \"Feire moder, heire ben\ncome men of fer contrees, for to seche me, and I will go by youre\nleve; ffor me houeth to yelde the to Ihesu Criste, of that he hath\nyove me power, and that I may not do; but I go thider as thei\nshullen lede me.  And Blase, youre maister, also shall go, and\nmoste we bothe departe fro yow at this tyme.\"  \"Ffeire sone,\"\nquod she, \"to god I comaunde yow, for I knowe not yef it were\nwisdome to witholde yow, or noon; but yef it were youre plesier,\nI wolde that Blase sholde a-bide.\"  \"Dame,\" quod he, \"it may\nin no wise ben.\" Thus toke Merlyn leve of his moder and wente with the\nmassengers, and on the tother side Blase departed, and\nyede in to Northumberlond , ther Merlin had hym comaunded,\nand the massagiers rode forth till thei come thourgh a town in\nwhiche was a market, and when thei were passed thourgh thei\nouertoke a carl, that hadde bought a payre of stronge shone, and\nalso stronge lether to clowte hem with.  And when merlyn sye\nthe carle he be-gan to laughe.  The messagiers axed hym\nwherfore he lough.  \"I laugh,\" quod he, \"at this cherl that hath\nbought hym so stronge shoone, and also clowte lether, and I telle\nyow certeynly that he shalbe dead before he come fully to his\nhowse.\" And when thei herde thes, thei heilde it a grete\nmerveile, and seide thei wolde wyte yef that were trewe.  Than\ntwo of them sewed hym, and other two abode with\nMerlyn.  They hadde not folowed the cherl half a myle, that thei fonde\nhym deed, in myddell of the wey, and his shone a-boute his\nnekke.  Than thei returned, and ouer-toke hir felowes, and\ntolde hem the merveyle that thei hadde seien.  \"Fforsothe,\"\nquod thei, \"grete foles were the clerkes that so wise a man wolde\nhave slayn.\"  \"In feith,\" qou the oon, \"I sholde suffer grete myschef er he had eny harm.\"  And so thei seiden alle iiij,\nthat Merlyn ne herde it not.  And when thei were come to\nmerlyn, he thanked hem of that thei hadde seide, and that wolde\nhym so moche gode.  And thei were gretly abasshed, and\nseiden, \"We may nought sey, ne do, but this childe knowe it.\"\nThus thei riden forth her iourneis, till thei come with-inne\nVortigers power.  And as thei passed thourgh a town, they\nsaugh a deed childe on a beere, born to chirche, to be\nberied.  And after the corse was made grete doel and wepynge.  And\nwhen Merlyn saugh the wepynge, and sye the preste and the\nclerkes wente synginge be-fore, he gan to laugh, and seide to his\nfelowes, \"I se a merveile.\"  And thei axed, \"What?\"  Quod\nmerlyn, \"Ye se that gode man that maketh this grete sorowe.\"\nAnd thei seide, \"Ye.\"  \"And se ye not the preeste that singeth\nall be-fore.\"  Quod thei, \"We se hym well.\"  \"Forsothe,\" quod\nMerlin, \"he ought to make the sorowe that the tother gode man\nmaketh, for wethet it well that the childe is the prestes sone;\nand the other man wepeth, and hath more cause to laugh.\"\nQuod thei, \"How may we knowe that it be so?\"  \"Goth to\nthe moder, and axe whi she doth wepe; and she will sey for her\nsone, that is deed.  And ye shall sey, it is not hir sone, but the\nPrestes sone, that so hye singeth; and than shall ye heere what\nshe will sey.\" The massagers wente to the woman, and toke her in\ncounseill, and seide as Merlyn hadde hem taught.  And when\nthe woman herde hem so sey, she was abaisshed, and seide,\n\"Seres, for godes love, mercy!  I se wele I may not to yow\nlye, thowgh I wolde, for that ye sey is trewe; but I be-seche\nyow telle it not my housbonde, for than he wolde me sle.\"  And\nwhen thei hadde herde this merveile, they turned, and ouertoke\nher felishep, and seiden as thei herde.  And than thei reden\nforth till they come a iourney fro thens ther Vortiger was.  Than\nseide two of the messagers to Merlin, \"We shall go be-fore to\nthe kynge, and telle hym \u00feat we have founden; now yeve us\ncounseile how thow wilte we shall sey, for I trowe he will blame\nus that we have not the slayn.\"  \"Sirs,\" quod Merlyn, \"sey as I shall telle yow, and ye shalbe well excused.  Ye shull go to\nVortiger, and sey that ye have me founden, and sey I shall telle\nhym truly the cause whi his tour may not stonde; with this\ncondicion: that the Clerkes haue the same Iuyse that thei hadde\nordeyned for me.  And also sey him, I can telle hym why the\nclerkes wolde haue me deed.  And when ye have seide thus, doth\nhardely that he yow comaundeth.\"  With that the messagers\ndeparted, and come to Vortiger.  And when he sye them, he was\ngladde, and axed a-noon how they hadde spedde. \"Sir,\" seide\nthei, \"in the beste wise that we may.\"  Than they cleped\nthe kynge in counseile, and tolde how thei hadde founde Merlyn;\nand also they seide, yef he hym-self ne wolde, they sholde hym\nneuer have founden.  \"Of whiche Merlyn,\" seide the kynge,\n\"speke ye? sholde ye not haue sought the fadirles childe, and\nhave brought me the blode of hym.\"  \"Sir,\" thei seide, \"that\nsame is Merlyn, that we of speke to yow.  And wetith it wele\nthat he is the wisest man, and the beste devynour that is, saf\nonly god.  And, sir,\" seide thei, \"right as ye made vs to\nswere to do youre comaundement, all that was don and seide he\ncowde wele telle vs, at oure firste metynge, and he tolde vs also\nthat the clerkes ne knewe not the cause why that youre tour may\nnot stonde; but he shall telle yow apertly.  And many other\ngrete merveiles hath he vs shewed be the wey; and hath vs sente\nfor to wite yef ye will with hym speke.  And yef ye will we\nshull sle hym, for two of oure felowes beth there as he is.\"  \"Yef\nye,\" quod the kynge, \"will take vpon youre lyves that he shall\ntelle me whi my toure fallith, I will not \u00feat he be deed.\"  \"We\nwill vndertake it,\"  quod thei.  \"Than, go fecche hym,\" quod\nthe kynge. The messagers yede their wey, and the kynge rode after\nhem.  When Merlin saugh the messagers, he seide to them, \"Ye\nhave plegged me vpon youre lyves that I shall have no drede of\ndeth,\" and thei ansuerde, \"Thou seiste trewe, for hadde lever\na be in grete auenture than thow sholdest dye, and that oon moste vs nedes do.\"  \"I shall waraunte yow,\" quod merlin, \"of\nthat ye have vndertake.\"  Thus thei rode forth till thei mette\nwith the kynge, and a-noon merlin hym salued, and seide, \"Sir\nkynge, lete me speke with yow in counseile.\"  Than the kynge\ndrough a-part, and called hem that he hadde brought with\nhym.  \"Sir,\" quod merlyn, \"thow haste do seche me for thi toure that\nmay not stonde, and comaundeste me to sle be counseile of thy\nClerkes, \u00feat seide the toure sholde holde by vertu of my\nblode.  Thei have not seide the trouth; but yef thow wilte graunte me\nto do to hem the same that thei wolde do to me, I will telle the\ncause whi it falleth, and also I shall teche the how thow shalt\nmake it to stonde and endure.\"  And Vortiger ansuerde, \"Yef\nthow do as thou seiest I will do with hem as thow wilte.\"\n\"Than,\" quod Merlin, \"go we thider as this toure is in makynge,\nand make the Clerkes be brought theder, and I shall axe hem\nwhi the toure doth falle, and so mayste thow hiere ther\nansuere.\"  Than thei wente to the place ther the toure\nsholde be made, and the clerkes were sente fore, and come\nbe-fore the kynge. And whan thei were come, Merlyn made oon to axe of hem\nwhi that that toure fill, and thei ansuerde, \"We knowe\nno cause whi it fill, but we can telle what shall make it for to\nholde.\"  And then seide the kynge, \"Ye tolde me a merveillouse\nthynge, that I sholde do seche a childe born with-outen fader,\nand I wote not how he myght be founden.\"  Than spake Merlyn\nand seide to the clerkes, \"Sirs, ye holde the kynge a fole, that\nthus make hym seche a man that is born with-outen fader, and\nye no do it nothynge for his profite; but ye dide it for this, that\nye fonde in youre sorte that ye shulde be deed thourgh hym, and\nfor drede ther-of haue ye do the kynge to vnderstonde that I\nsholde be slayn, and my blode be putte in the foundement of\nthe toure, and that sholde make it to laste and holde; thus ye\nthought to sle hym, be the whiche ye sholde be brought to the\ndeth as be youre sorte.\"  When thei herde the child telle hem that thei supposid no creature hadde knowen, thei weren a-basshed,\nand wiste wele that thei sholde dye.  Than Merlin seide to the\nkynge, \"Now may ye knowe whi these clerkes wolde have me\nslayn: nought for to holde youre toure, but for theire sorte seyde\nthei sholde dye for me.  Now axe hem yef this be true, for thei\nsholde not be so hardy be-fore me to make yow no lesynge.\"\n\"Seith he trewe?\" quod the kynge.  \"Sir,\" said the clerkes,\n\"ye, truly; but we merveile wherby he myght this\nknowe.  Wherfore we be-seke yow to graunte vs to live, that we may see\nthat he shewe the trowth whi the toure fallith, and yef he can\ntelle the remedye.\"  \"Certes,\" quod Merlyn, \"have ye no drede\nto dye be-fore ye se the cause that the toure doth falle, and that\nthe werke may not laste?\"  \"Sir kynge,\" quod Merlin,\n\"vnderstonde, and I shall telle the.  Vnder this erthe is a grete water,\nand vnder that water be two dragons that see no sight; so is that\noon reade and that other white, and a-bove them is two grete\nflat stones, and when thei fele that the werke peyseth hevy upon\nthem, they turne hem, and the water maketh so grete bruyt that\nall that is made a-boven it moste nede falle.  Now lete loke yef\nthis be trewe or no; and yef it be founde that this be cause\nthat the werke stondeth not, lete my plegges be quyte, and the\nclerkes in blame, that of all this ne knewe nothinge.\"  \"Certes,\"\nquod Vortiger, \"yef this be as thow seist, than art thow the\nwisest man of the worlde.  Now telle me how this erthe may be\nhadde a-wey.\"  And Merlin seide, \"In cartes and on mennes\nnekkes.\"  A-noon the kynge made come laboreres, and Merlin\ncomaunded that the clerkes sholde be wele kepte, and so wrought\nthe laboreres, that thei hadde a-wey the erthe, and fonde the\nwater, and dede it to laden oute, and lete the kynge wite how\nthei hadden don.  The kynge come thider gladly, and brought\nwith hym merlin.  When he com thider, he beheilde the water\nthat was grete, and cleped two of his counsellers, and seide,\n\"This childe is right wise that knewe this to ben heere, and yet\nseith that ther ben two dragons vnder, and I will knowe the\nsoth, what-so-euer it coste.\"  Than the kynge cleped Merlyn,\nand seide, \"How shall we haue this water a-wey?\"  Quod Merlyn, \"Lete make goteres in to the diches.\"  Than were the\ndiches made, and the water to renne oute.  And Merlyn come to\nVortiger, and seide, \"As soone as these dragons felen to-geder thei\nwill fighten strongely, and that oon shall sle that other; therfore\nsend after alle the gode men of thi londe to se the bataile, for it\nhath grete singnification.\"  Than sente Vortiger after alle the\nworthy men of his londe, Clergie and other; and when thei were\nalle comen, Vortiger tolde hem the merveiles that Merlin hadde\nshewde, and of the two dragons how thei shulde fight.  Than\nseide oon to a-nother, \"It is gode to be seen;\" and they axed the\nkynge yef he knewe whiche sholde haue the better; and the\nkynge seide he hadde not yet tolde.  Whan the water was all\nvoided thei saugh the two stones that were vpon the two\ndragons.  The kynge axed how thei myght be hadde a-wey, and\nMerlyn seide, \"Full wele, for they will neuer meve till eche of\nhem fele other, and than shull thei fight till that oon muste dye.\"\nThe kynge axed, \"Whiche shall have the victorie?\"  \"In the\nfightynge,\" quod Merlyn, \"is grete signifiance, whiche I may\nnot telle, but gladly I will tele the be-fore three worthi men.\"\nThan Vortiger cleped thre men that he moste truste inne, and\nMerlyn axed, \"Be these thre men wele of thi counseile?\" and\nhe ansuewerde, \"Ye.\"  \"Than may I telle be-fore them that\nthou demandest.  I do the to wete,\" quod he, \"that the white\nshall sle the reade; but first shall he have grete peyne, and in\nthat he shall sle hym is grete tokenynge to hym that can it\nvnderstonde; but I will sey no more till the bataile is at an\nende.\"  Than yede the peple to oon of the stones, and leften it\nup, and founde the white dragon.  When the peple saugh hym\nso grete and hidouse thei hadde grete drede.  Than wente thei\nto the tother ston, and drough it a-wey, and than thei were\nmore aferde than be-fore, for it was moche greter and semed\nmore feirce.  And as Vortiger semed he moste ouercome that\nother.  And Merlin seide to the kynge, \"Now lete my plegges\nbe quyte.\"  \"So be thei,\" seide the kynge.  Tho spronge vp\nthe two dragons and foughten to-geder with teeth and feet, and\nneuer herde ye of so stronge bataile be-twene two bestes, ne so crewell fight.  And so thei foughten to mydday, and the peple\nsemed that the reade sholde ouercome the white, till that the\nwhite threwe so moche fiere and flame that he brente vp the\nreade, and so was he deed.  Than the white leide hym down to\nreste for werynesse, and ne lived after but thre dayes.  And\nthei that this syen seyde that neuer so grete merveile hadde be\nseyn be-forn.  And Merlin seide to the kynge, \"Now mayste\nthow make thi toure as grete and large as thow wilte, for it\nshall no more falle.\"  Than comaunded Vortiger the werkemen\nto make vp the toure the strongest that myght be devised; and\noften axed Vortiger of Merlyn the significance of the two\ndragons.  And he seid, \"It was the tokenynge of thinges that were don\nand also of thinges that were to come, and yef thow wilte ensure\nme that thow shalt do me noon harme heere in audience of this\npeple, ne suffer noon other to do me harme in thy reame, I will\ntelle the significacion.\"  And Vortiger made hym soche suerte\nas he wolde.  Quod Merlin, \"Bringe hethir thy counsell, and\nthe clerkes that sorted of this toure.\"  The kynge dide as he\ncomaunded.  When thei were come Merlyn spake to the clerkes,\nand seide, \"Ye were foles in youre art, that wolde not a-quite\nyow as trewe men, and therfore ye be worthi to haue as ye\nhaue deserved.  And ye sawgh wele how I was bore.  And he\nthat shewed yow that, made yow semblance that ye sholde be\ndeed for me, and that dide he for sorowe that he hadde loste me,\nand therfore he wolde that ye hadde me putte to deth; but I\nhaue soche a goode lorde, that he shall me deffende yef it be\nhis plesier, and I shall make hym a lyer, for ye shull neuer\nfor me be deed, yef ye will me graunte to do that I shall\nyow sey.\"  And when they herde hym sey that thei sholbe\nrespited fro deth thei were gladde, and seiden, \"What that\nthow comaundest we shall do it, for we se well that thow\narte the wisest man that liveth.\"  Quod Merlin, \"Ye shull\nswere neuer to entermete of that arte, and I will that ye be\nconfessed and take youre penaunce so that youre soules be not\ndampned.\"  And thei hym thankeden, and seide thei sholde\ndo his comaundement. Thus delyuered Merlin the Clerkes, whiche made hym to be\nsought for to be putte to deth.  Vortiger com to hym, and\nseide, \"Telle me the significaunce of the two dragons.\"  \"The\nreade dragon,\" quod Merlin, \"be-tokeneth the, and the white\ndragon signifieth the sones of Constance.\"  When Vortiger\nherde this, he was a-shamed.  And merlin seide, \"Yef thow\nwilte, I will sey more; with that thow conne me no\nmagre.\"  Vortiger seide, \"Here ne is no man, but of my prive counsell; and\ntherfore I will thow telle me alle the trouthe.\"  \"I tolde the,\"\nquod Merlin, \"that the reade signifieth the, and I shall telle the\nhow the children of Constance were yonge and tender, after the\ndeth of their fader; and yef thow were soche as thow oughteste\nto have ben, thow sholdeste have kepte hem, and yeven hem\ncounseile a-geins alle erthly men.

And thei that thow seidest\nthis to, vndirstoden wele that thow woldest haue hym deed; and\nand ther-fore thei slowen their kynge.  But thei leften two\nbrethern, the whiche fledde in to straunge londe, for drede of\nthe.  And so were thow made kynge; and yet thow holdest\ntheir heritage with wronge.  And when thei had kylde the\nkynge Moyne, thei come be-fore the; thow madest hem to be\ndistrowied, to shewe semblaunce as thow hadde for-thought the\nkynges deth.\"  Vortiger vndirstode wele that Merlyn hym tolde,\nand wiste wele that he tolde hym the trouth; and seide, \"I se well\nthat thow art oon of the wisest men of the worlde.  Wherfore,\nI pray the to yeve me counseill in this cas, and also telle me on\nwhat deth I shall dye.\"  Quod he, \"Yef I telle the that I wilnot\nsey the betokenyng of the two dragons.  I do the to wite that\nthe reade Dragon signifieth the, in that he was so grete and\nhidouse, be-tokeneth the, and thy grete power.

THE DEFEAT OF VORTIGER BY PENDRAGON AND UTER; THEIR SEARCH AFTER MERLIN;  THE BATTLE OF SALISBURY AND DEATH OF PENDRAGON; AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE TABLE AT CARDOELL, IN WALES. Full sorowfull was Vortiger of these tidinges, and axed of\nMerlin yef it myght be eny other maner.  And he seide,\n\"Nay.\"  And when Vortiger knewe that the children come\nwith so grete power, he somowned his peple a-geyn the tierme\nthat Merlyn hadde seide.  Vortiger com to Wynchester with\nall his oste, but no man ne wiste the cause whi, saf thei that\nweren of his counseile.  And as soone as Merlin hadde seid the\nkynge, alle the tokenynges of the two dragons, he toke leve,\nand wente to Blase, and tolde hym alle thynges like as were\nbeffalle; and he wrote it in his boke.  And ther was Merlyn longe\ntyme, till that the sones of Constance lete seche hym in many\ncontrees.  Vortiger a-bode to the day that Merlin hadde rehersed;\nthe same day saugh thei of Wynchester the shippes comynge by\nthe see; where-in weren the two sones of Constance.  And than\nVortiger comaunded his peple to armes, and to deffende the portes.  And when thei of the portes saugh the baners roiall of\nkynge Constance, thei hadde grete merveile, till that the vessell\nthat the two brethern were inne come in to the havene.  And\nthei that kepte the porte axed to whom longed that vessell; and\nthey ansuerde it was the vessell of Pendragon and Vter, whiche\nwere come in to their owne londe, to take vengaunce on Vortiger,\nthat as a fals traytour longe tyme hade them disherited.  When\nthe peple of the contre saugh their lorde haddde brought so grete\npower, thei seide they wolde no longer hoilde with\nVortiger.  And when he saugh the moste parte of his peple him failled, he\nhadde grete drede, and seide to them that he trusted that thei\nsholde stuffe the Castell; and thei dide so.  The shippes weren\na-rived, and the knyghtes isseden owte, and alle the other\npeple.  And the peple of the contre wente a-geyn hem; and them\nresceved as they sholde do her lorde.  Vortiger and his mayne\nweren in the Castell, and the two brethern assailled hym\nvigorously, till that Pendragon caste in fier, and brente vp Vortiger,\nand alle that were in the castell with hym.  And thus toke they\nvengaunce on their enmy.  Aurelius Ambrose made Pendragon\nkynge, whiche was a Iuste man and a trewe.  And the Danoys,\nthat Vortiger hadde brought in to the londe, werred sore vpon\nthe cristen peple.  And pendragon be-seged Aungier in the\ncastell of the Vysee.  And ther thei token counsell how thei\nmyght beste take the Castell.  At this counseill were v barons,\nthat hadde herde the significance of the two dragons, that Merlin\nhadde expowned to Vortiger.  And so thei cleped Pendragon and\nhis counseill a-part, and tolde hem the merveile that thei hadde\nherde of Merlyn.  And, \"wite ye well,\" seide thei, \"that he is\nthe beste devynour that is, saf god oonly.\"  And Pendragon\naxed where he myght be founden.  And thei seide, \"We knowe\nnot in what contree.\"  Quod Pendragon, \"Yef he be in this\nlonde, he shall welbe founden.\"  Than sente Pendragon thourgh\nhis londe, to seche Merlyn.  And Merlin, that knewe all this,\ntolde it to Blase, and departed fro hym, and com in to a town\nwhere as the messagers were that soughten after hym.  He\ncome to hem like a begger, with boustouse shone on his feet, and in a cote al to rente, and hadde a grym berde and steirne\nloke.  He come in to the house that they were inne, and seide, \"Ye do\nsymply youre mayster erende, as he yow comaunded for to seche\nMerlin.\"  And thei ansuerde, \"What deuell who hath tolde this\ncherl, wher-of entermeteth he?\"  Quod the cherl, \"Yef I\nwolde, I sholde fynde hym moche sonner than ye.\"  Than they\nturned towarde hym, and axed hym yef he hadde euer hym\nsien.  \"Ye,\" quod he, \"I have sein hym, and I knowe his repaire;\nbut he tolde me that ye labour a-boute nought ffor to seche hym,\nfor though he mette with yow, he wil not go with yow.  But go\nto youre prynce, and telle hym that he shall neuer wynne the\nCastell till Aungier be slain.  And wete ye wel that of the v\nthat tolde the kynge tidinges of Merlin, ye shall fynde but two\nlivinge.  And telle youre lorde, yef he will fynde Merlin, lete\nhym seche hym in the forestes of this contree.\" The messagers vndirstod wele that Merlyn hem tolde, and\nthat oon be-heilde that other, and a-noon he was oute of\nther sight; and than they seide to hem-self, \"We have spoken\nwith the devell.  What shull we do of that he hath vs seide?\"\n\"Forsothe,\" quod that oon of hem, \"we shull go telle oure\nlorde like as he hath vs seide.\"  And than thei riden forth till\nthey come in to the oste ther as the kynge was; and a-noon as\nthe kynge hem sygh, he axed, \"Have ye founde hym that ye\nwente for to seche?\"  \"Sir,\" they seide, \"we shall telle yow\nlike as we have founden.\"  Than thei tolde the kynge of all that\nthe cherl hadde seide vn-to hem all as it was.  And when the\nkynge herde this he merveiled, and so dide thei that hadden first\nenformed the kynge of Merlyn, for that the messagers spoken of\nso grym and hidouse man, for supposid that Merlin myght not\ntake noon other shapte but his owne; netherdeles, thei knewe\nwele ther cowde no man have seide thise wordes but it hadde a\nbe Merlin, and axed of the messagers in what place it was that\nthei founde this cherl.  \"Truly,\" seide thei, \"he come in to\noure loigginge in Northumberlonde while we satte at oure\nmete.\"  Than seiden thei that it was Merlyn with-outen faile, and that\nhe wolde the kynge hym-self sholde come seche hym.  Quod the kynge, \"I shall leve the reame to my brother Vter, and I will\ngo my self to speke with hym.\"  And they come in\nNorthumberlonde, they enquered tidinges of Merlin, but thei founde noon\nthat ought of hym cowde sey.  And as the kynge rode thourgh\nthe foreste it fill that a man of his fonde grete plente of bestes,\nand a man that hem kepte whiche was of a counterfete shapte\nand of a grym chere, and they axed hym of whens he was, and he\nansuerde, \"Of Northumberlonde, a seruaunt of a worthi man;\nbut yesterday,\" quod he, \"I saugh a man that tolde me that the\nkynge Pendragon come for to seche Merlin in this\ncontre.\"  Quod that other, \"It is soth that the kynge doth hym\nseken.  Canst thow ought telle where he is?\"  And the cherl ansuerde\nand seide, \"Yef I saugh the kynge, I wolde sey to hym that I\nwolde not telle the.\"  \"Than com with me,\" quod he, \"and I\nwill shewe the kynge.\"  Than seide the cherl, \"I sholde kepe\nmy bestes; but yef he come heder I will telle hym gode tydinges\nof that he goth sechinge.\"  Than he departed and come to the\nkynge, and seide as he herde the cherl say; and the kynge badde\n\"Bringe me ther.\"  Than he ledde the kynge to the same place,\nand seide to the cherl, \"Lo, her is the kynge; now sey to hym\nwhat thow wilt.\"  Quod he to the kynge, \"Thow goist sechinge\nMerlyn, but thow shalt not fynde hym till he will\nhym-self.  Therfore go to a gode town and take thy logginge, and he shall\nsone come to the when he wote thow doiste a-bide hym.\"  \"How\nmay I knowe that?\" seide the kynge.  Than the kynge rode\nto the nexte town that he fonde in the forest, and thider come\nto hym a comely man wele araied, and seide to the kynge, \"Sir,\nMerlin sente me hider to the, and sente the worde that it was\nhe, that thow mette with-inne the wode kepynge bestes.  Be\nthis token that he seide he will come to the when thow haste of\nhym myster, but now thow haste of hym no nede, and by me he\nsente the gode tidinges.  Wite thow wele that Aungier is ded,\nfor thy brother Vter hath hath hym slayn.\"  And tho the kynge\nhadde grete merveile, and seide, \"May this be true that thow seist.\"  \"He seide to me no more,\" quod he; \"but and thow\nmystruste hym thou art a foole.\" Than the kynge made two messagers to ryde in all haste, to\nwite yef it were true.  And thei rode forth till thei\nmetten the messagers of Vter, that come to telle the kynge of\nAungers deth.  And when thei weren mette, thei returned\na-geyn to the kynge, and tolde how Vter hadde slain\nAungier.  And the kynge comaunded hem to kepe counseile, for he\nmerveyled gretly how merlin myght have witinge ther-of, and\nthought in his herte that he wolde axe hym how Aungier was\ndeed.  And as the kynge come fro chirche on a day, ther mette\nhym a comly man, well araied, and clenly, that seide to hym,\n\"Sir kynge, what a-bideste thow in this town?\"  Quod the\nkynge, \"I a-bide after Merlin, that sholde come heder to speke\nwith me.\"  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"though ye mete hym, ye can not\nknowe hym; but clepe to yow soche men as ought for to knowe\nhym, and axe them yef I may be Merlin.\"  And they come\nbe-fore hym, and he hem frayned what was here\na-bidinge.  Quod they, \"We a-byde the gode devynour.\"  \"Sirs,\" seide the\nkynge, \"yef ye myght se Merlin, cowde ye hym knowen?\"\n\"Sire,\" seide thei, \"it myght not be but that we sholde hym\nkenne wele, yef we myght him se.\"  \"Sirs,\" quod he that\nwas be-fore the kynge, \"may eny man knowe a-nother when he\nknowith not hym-self.\"  And thei seiden, \"We may not wele\nknowe all his werkinge, but yef we myghten sen his semblaunce,\nwe sholden knowe hym wele.\"  And than ansuerde the man, and\nseide, \"Ther is no man that can at alle tymes knowe his\nsemblaunce.\"  And than he toke the kynge in counseile, and seide,\n\"Sir, I will be with yow, and with youre brother.  And I do yow\nto wete that I am he that ye have sought.  Now, go ye oute, and\nclepe hem that sey thei knowen Merlin; and as sone as they come,\nthei shull sey ye haue me founden.\"  Than was the kynge right\ngladde, and in all haste cleped hem that cowden knowe\nMerlin.  And Merlin toke the semblaunce that thei hadde sein hym\nbe-fore.  And a-noon thei seiden, \"Lo, here is Merlin.\"  Quod the kynge,\n\"Be well a-vised that ye knowe it is he.\"  And thei seide, \"We knowe verely it is he.\"  Than seide the kynge, \"I wolde fayn\nknowe yef euer I spake with yow be-fore, sith I come in to this\ncontre.\"  \"Sir,\"  quod Merlyn, \"I am the man that ye fonde\nkepinge the bestes, and also I am the man that tolde yow\nthat Aungier was deed.\"  Than seyde the kynge, \"Sirs, ye\nknewe Merlin full euell.\"  And thei seide, \"Sir, we sye hym neuer do thus be-forn.\"  And than the kynge axed of Merlyn,\n\"How knewe ye the deth of Aungiers.\"  Quod Merlyn, \"A-noon\nas ye were departed fro youre oste, to come hider, Aungiers wolde\nhaue morderid thi brother in his teinte.  And I wente to thi\nbrother, and warned hym of Aungiers purpos, and of his strengthe,\nand how he wolde come be nyght hym-self to his teynte, formeste\nof his company.  And thi brother dide not mystruste me, but\nmade good waicche all that nyght, sole be hym-self, till that\nAungiers com with a knyf in his honde, to sle thi brother.  And\nVter lete hym entre in to his teynte, and serched a-boute; but\nhe fonde not Vter ther-in, wherfore he was sory.  And at the\ncomynge owte, thi bro\u00feer faught with hym, and slowe hym his\nowne handes.\"  Than the kynge axed hym in what semblaunce\nhe hadde spoken with his brother.  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"I was like\na sadde olde man.\"  Quod the kynge, \"Tolde ye hym what ye\nwere?\"  And Merlyn seide, \"Nay; ne he ne shall not wite till\nye telle hym youre self.\"  Than seide the kynge, \"I pray yow\nright, deere frende, that ye will come with me, for I have grete\nnede of youre counseile.\"  \"Sir,\" quod Merlin, \"the sonner I\ncome ther, the wrother shull be youre meyne.\"  Quod the kynge,\n\"Thow hast seyde so moche, that thow hast saued my brother fro\nthe deth, that I shall neuer the mystruste.\"  Quod Merlyn,\n\"I shall speke with thi brother in the same forme that I warned\nhym of his deth, and shalbe with-inne this xj dayes.\"  And the\nkynge seide, \"And it plese yow, lete me wite when ye shull\nspeke with hym.\"  \"Ye shull wite it well,\" quod Merlin, \"but,\nloke ye, discure it not to noon creature, as ye will haue my love.\" Thus was Pendragon and Merlin first a-queynted.  And\nMerlin toke his leve, and wente to Blase, his maister, and\ntolde hym alle thinges.  And he wrote hem in his boke.  Pendragon taried not till he come to his brother Vter.  Wher-of\nVter was ioyfull, and toke the kynge in counseile, and tolde hym\nof the deth of Aungiers, in the same wise as Merlin hadde\ntolde.  Quod the kynge, \"I pray yow telle me what man that was that\nwarned yow of Aungiers.\"  \"Be the feith that I owe to yow,\"\nquod Vter, \"I can not sei what he is, but wele he semed a wise\nman, and therfore I yaf to his counseile credence.\"  \"Brother,\"\nquod Pendragon, \"kowde ye ought knowe hym, and ye myght se\nhym agein?\"  \"Sir,\" seide Vter, \"ye, right wele.\"  And\nPendragon seide, \"I do yow to wete he will speke with yow\nwithinne these xj dayes; but I pray yow that ye be euer in my\npresence, that I may se alle tho that come to speke with yow,\nthat I may wite whether I may knowe hym sonner than ye.\"\nAnd Vter ther-to graunted.  And Merlin tolde all this to Blase:\nhow the two brethern hadde spoke to-geder, and how thei were\nacorded of hym, and how Pendragon wolde assaie hym in all the\nmaner that he myght.  Than Blase axed what he dought to\ndo.  And Merlyn seide, \"Thei be yonge men and Iolye, and have\ngrete nede of counseile, and I knowe a faire lady that Vter\nparamours.  And I will go, and bringe hym a letter, as it were from\nher, for I knowe alle the prevy wordes that have ben be-twene hem two.  The xj e day come Merlin to courte, like a boy that\nhadde ben a messager from Vters love, and seyde, \"My lady\nsente me to yow, and sendeth yow gretinge, and sente yow this\nletter.\"  And Vter toke it with grete ioye, for he wende his\nlady hadde sent hym that letter, and seide he sholde yeve\ncredence to the bringer ther-of, and of all that he sholde sey.  And\nMerlin tolde hym many tidinges, soche as he wiste wele that he\nwolde gladly listen.  Thus a-bode Merlin with hym, till it was ny\neven; and grete merveile hadde Pendragon that Merlin com not\nas he hadde made promyse, till that merlin drow hym a-syde, and\ntoke the same semblaunce that he spake with Vter the firste\ntyme that he warned hym of his deth.  And a-noon, as Vter\nhym saugh, he knewe hym wele, and praide hym that he wolde\ntarie a-while, till he hadde spoke with the kynge, his\nbrother.  And Vter tolde Pendragon how the gode man was come that warned hym of the treson of Aungiers.  And than come the\nbothe to-geder to that man.  And whan the kynge sye hym, he\nmade grete ioye, and seide he was welcome.  And than the\nkynge seide, \"Will ye that I telle my brother who ye ben, and\nwhat youre name is?\"  And Merlin ansuerde, \"I will wele that\nhe knowe what I am.\"  Than seide the kynge, \"Feire brother,\nye knowe not who this worthi man is.  I will that ye wete he is\nthe wisest man that leveth, and moste may vs profite and\nhelpe.  And I do yow to wite that ther come noon other boy in message\nbe-fore yow this day, saf this worthy man.  And he hym-self\ntoke yow the letter fro youre souereine lady.\"  When Vter herde\nthis, he was astoned sore, and seyde to hym-self, \"How myght I\nthis knowe, or be-leve, for it were the most merveile of the\nworlde.\"  Quod he, \"Wite it wele ye may it als truly be-leve as\neny thinge that ye beste knowe.\"  \"In feith,\" quod Vter, \"I\nmay not leve it, but I myght it other-wise prove.\"  Than the\nkynge prayde Merlyn that he wolde shewe some maner\ndemonstraunce.\"  \"Than,\" quod Merlyn, \"go ye a litell oute, and\nshall shewe the same boy that brought the letter.\"  And thei\nyede oute of the chamber, and Merlin toke a-gein the semblaunce\nof a boy, and come to Vter, and seide, \"Sir, I will go; is ther\neny thinge that ye will comaunde me?\"  And than seide the\nkynge, \"Brother, be thow right sure that this is the same man\nthat warned you of Aungys treson; and I lete yow wite that he\nhath power to knowe alle thinges that beth do or spoken, and of\nthinges that be to come grete partie.  Wherfore I wolde hertely\npray hym to be with vs of oure counseile; and by hym shall we\nbe rulid of alle oure gouernaunce, for, trnly, brother, we have\ngrete nede therto, and it were his plesier.\"  Than bothe the\nbrethern be-sought hym full lowly to a-bide with hem, and thei to\nbe gouerned by hym as he wolde.  And than Merlyn seide, \"I lete\nyow wite that I knowe alle thinges, that me leste to wite.\"  Quod\nVter, \"Haue to me seide so moche, that neuer shall I mys-trowe\nthe fro hens all my live.  And for youre grete wisdome, and it\nlike yow, I wolde ye were lorde and gouernour of my brother and\nme.\"  And Merlin ansuerde, \"I will be with yow many tymes, and I will also that ye tweyn prively in counseile knowe my\ncondicions and my behavynge; but I moste be ofte tymes in the forestes,\nthe chief of grete Bretaigne.  And knoweth wele, in what place that\neuer I be, in the moste remembraunce that I shall haue, shall be\nvpon yow, and on yowre nedes, more than eny others.  And in\nwhat maner nede that ye have in eny encombraunce, I will\neuer redily come to yow, and helpe yow, and counseile.  And\ntherfore recched neuer when I go or come; and at alle tymes,\nwhen I come, make grete gladnesse of me be-fore youre peple, in\nyoure howsolde.\"  In this maner was Merlin witholden with\nPendragon and his brother Vter.  And he toke his leve of hem, and\nseide he wolde shewe hym in the same semblaunce that the peple\nof the contre were wonte to knowe hym inne.  And when he\ncome a-monge them, thei that knewe hym made grete ioye, and\nrunne to telle the kynge that Merlin was comen.  And a-noon the\nkynge wente a-geins hym; and grete was the ioye that the kynge\nmad of Merlin.  And when he was ther-inne, thei that hadde\nknowinge of hym toke the kynge in counseile, and seide, \"Sir, lo,\nheir is Merlin, whiche is the wysest man that is in all the worlde,\nsaf god al only.  Therfore, pray hym to teche you how ye shull\ndo in getynge of this castell, and how that this werre shall ende.\"\nThe kynge seyde he wolde gladly of hym enquere, as thei\ndesired.  And so at that thei sesid, for the kynge wolde hym\nwurship and honoure in all that he myght.  And on the thirde\nday the kynge made alle his counseile a-semble, and than the\nkynge demaunded Merlin of that his barons hadden desired to\nknowe, and seide, \"Dere frende, I have herde moche spek of\nyow, that ye be oon the wisest man that is in the\nworlde.  Wherfore, I pray and requere yow in this wise, that I shall euer be at\nyoure wille, that ye will lete wite how I myght haue this castell.\"\nAnd Merlin ansuerde, and seide, \"I do yow to wite as sone as\nthe sarazins have loste Aungys, thei desire nought ellis but\nforsake the londe.  And to-morow sende to hem to wite what thei\nwill do; and thei will desire the londe that thei were wonte to holde of youre fader; but ye ne shull not agre ther-to, but when\nye knewe their ansuere, ye shall offer them to condite oute of the\nlonde, and shippes to their passage.\"  Than sente the kynge,\nVlfyn and thre other knyghtes, and Merlin yaf hem the message. These messagers wente towarde the castell, and when the\nsarazins sye hem comynge thei yede hem a-geins, and\nfreyned yef thei were come in message fro the kynge; and\nVlfyn seide, \"Ye.\"  Quod Vlfin, \"The kynge sente yow trewis\nfor thre wokes.\"  And thei ansuerde, \"We will take\ncounseile.\"  Than thei yede to-geder a-parte, and seiden, \"We beth\ngretly hyndred be the deth of Aungys, and we haue heere no\nvitaile to abide after socour of oure frendes, and heere is profered\nvs trewis to passe, and with-oute vitaile we may not longe\nendure; but lete vs sende to hym to suffer vs to haue the castell\nand the londe that longeth ther-to for to be holden of hym and\nof his heyres, and that we have xxx ti knyghtes on horse to yeve\nhym to trewage, a C stedes, a C palfrayes, and a hundred\nfaucons.\"  And to this thei acorded alle, and come to the\nmessagers and tole as thei were acorded, and thei returned and tolde\nthe kynge their ansuere, and the kynge axed Merlyn his advise,\nand Merlin seide, \"This shall ye not do, for therof sholde come\ngrete harmes; but I shall telle yow how ye shall do.  Sende to\nhem a-noon with oute tariynge that thei yelde yow the castell,\nand thei shall do it gladly, ffor thei have no vitaile; and profer\nhem to go saf with their lyves, and I do yow to wite they had\nneuer gretter gladnesse.\"  And as Merlin devised, the kynge\ndide, and sente his message with this requeste.  When thei of\nthe Castell herde thei myght go saf with thier lyves, thei hadde\ngrete ioye, and that was cried thourgh the londe.  And the\nkynge lete condite hem to the portes, and deliuered hem the\nnavie in to passe.  Thus were alle put oute of the londe, be\ncounseile of Merlyn, and so was Merlyn all gouernoure of the kynge\nand his counseile longe tyme; till on a day that he spake with\nthe kynge of a great matire, wherof oon of the barons hadde grete\nenvye, and come to the kynge, and seide, \"Sir, it is a grete\nmerveile that ye have so grete bileve to this man, for wite it verily, all that he can cometh by the devell.  And yef it plese yow, I\nshall a-say hym, so that ye shall se it aptly.\"  Quod the kynge,\n\"I will well that ye assay hym in soche maner that he ne be not\nwroth.\"  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"I shall not do nothinge that sholde\ncause hym to be angry.\"  And the kynge hym graunted.  This\nbaron was right wise, and full of euell vyces.  And on a day he\ncome to court, and made Merlin grete chere, and called hym\nbe-fore the kynge in counseile, and wele xx ti knyghtes.  And\nthan he seide to kinge, \"Sir, here is Merlin, which is \u00fee\nwisest man of the worlde, and he tolde Vortiger of his deth, and\nhow ye sholde do hym be brent.  I pray yow for that ye knowe\nwele that I have grete sekenesse, that he will telle yow what\ndeth I shall deye, yef he knowe it.\" Than ansuerde Merlin, that wele knewe his fell herte, and\nseide, \"Sire, ye have me praide to telle of youre deth,\nand I shall sey the soth; ffor that day thow shalt dye, thow\nshalt falle of an horse, and breke thy nekke.\"  And seide he to\nthe kynge, \"Sir, ye have herde how he hath seide; and god\ndefende me ther-fro.\"  Than he wente hom to his contre as\nsoone as he myght, and after com to courte a-gein to the kynge,\nand made hym right seke; and sente to the kynge in counseill,\nthat he sholde come se hym, and that he sholde bringe with hym\nMerlin in soche wise that Merlin sholde not knowe the cause\nwhy.  And the kynge assented.  And the kynge come to Merlin, and\nseide, \"There is a seke man, lete vs go se how it is with hym.\"\nAnd Merlin seide, \"Sir, a kynge ought not to go so prevely, but\nto haue his meyne a-boute hym.\"  And the kynge cleped\nsoche as he wolde, and wente to the seke man.  And when thei\ncome ther, he seide to the kynge, \"Sir, I pray yow that ye will\naxe youre devynour yef I shall dye on this sekeness.\"  And\nMerlin seide, \"He shall not dye on this maladye.\"  Tho enforced\nhe to speke, and seide, \"Sir, on what deth than shall I dye?\"\nAnd Merlin ansuerde, and seide, \"Thow shalt be hanged, and so\nshalt thow dye hanginge.\"  And than made Merlin semblaunce as he hadde be wroth.  And when he wiste that Merlin was gon,\nhe seide to the kynge, \"Sir, now wite ye verily that he is but a\nfole, that hath tolde these two dethes, whiche may not be\nacordinge; and yet I shall assay hym the thirde tyme.  I will\ntomorowe go to an Abbey, and feyne me stronge sike, and I shall\nsende to yow that a monke of his is so sike that he is in doute of\nhis lif, and pray yow to brynge with yow Merlin.\"  And the\nkynge it graunted.  And than wente this baron to an abbey, and\ndide all in like wyse as he hadde devised to the kynge.  And\nthan he sente for the kynge, and he come, and brought Merlyn;\nand so thei come ridynge to the abbey, and herde messe.  After\nmasse, come the Abbot, be-sechynge the kynge to come se a\nMonke whiche was sore seke, and that it plesed hym to bringe\nwith hym the wise man Merlin.  And the kynge axed of Merlin\nyef he wolde go thider with hym.  And Merlyn seide, \"Ye;\nbut first I will speke with yow and with Vter.\"  And than he\ntoke hem a-part, and seide, \"Sirs, the more that I am with yow a-queynted, the more\nfoles I fynde yow.  Wene ye that I knowe not what\ndeth this fole shall on dye; and ye shull haue now more\nmerveile than of all that I haue seide be-forn.\"  And the kynge\nansuerde, \"May this be true that he shall dye in soche wise?\"\n\"Yef it be not so,\" quod Merlin, \"leve me neuer of nothynge\nthat I shall sey; and thus moche I sey to Vter: that I shall se\nhis deth, er he departe his companye.\"  Than thei wente thider,\nas the abbot hem ledde; and the abbot seide to the kynge, \"Sir,\nplese it yow to axe of youre devynour, yef this seke shall euer be\nhoill of this sekenesse.\"  And Merlin made semblaunt as he hadde\nben wroth, and seide, \"He myght wele a-rise, for hym eyleth\nnoon evell.  And lete hym knowe verily that day he shall on dye\nhe shall breke his nekke, and be hanged, and also be\ndrowned.  And ther-fore lete hym no more feyne, for I knowe wele his\ncorage, and that his false herte thynketh.\"  And he a-ros vp\nsittynge, and seide to the kynge, \"Sir, now may ye wele knowe\nhis folye; how myght this be, that the day I shall on dye, I\nsholde breke my nekke, and be hanged, and also to be drowned; ffor I knowe wele that may not be, nother of me, ne of noon\nother.  Now loke yef ye be a wise man to yeve so grete credence\nto soche a man.\"  And thus thei departed, and all aboute it was\nknowen how Merlin hadde thus seide of this mannes deth.  After\nit fill on a day, that this man that thus sholde dye, rode with\nmoche peple, and come to a river, wher ouer was a bregge of\nof tymber.  And his palfrey stombled on his knees, and he\nouerthrew, and brakke hys neke, and he rolled don of the bregge in\nto the water, that a sharp planke of the brigge caught thourgh\nhis garment, so that his legges and his reynes hengen above the\nwater.  And many of them that were in his company were there\nas Merlin tolde of his deth.  The cry was grete that thei made\nto drawe hym oute of the water; and than thei seide, \"A grete\nfole he is that will not leve that Merlyn seith.\"  Thei diden\nwith the body as was right; and merlyn, that all this knewe\nwele, seide to the kynge and Vter how it was be-tid of this\nman.  And the kynge axed when this myght be, and he seide,\n\"Yesterday; and they that were with hym that tyme sholde come\nwithinne these vj dayes to bringe the tidynges.  And therfore I will\ngo, for I will not be here when thei come, for thei will demaunde\nme of many questions, wherof I will not ansuere, ne I ne will speke\nbut litill be-fore the peple, but so derkly that they shul not\nvndirstonde what I sey.\"  Thus seide Merlyn to the kynge and to Vter;\nwher-fore the kynge thought he hadde be wroth, and was\ntherfore full sory and hevy.  And so wente Merlyn to his maister Blase,\nand tolde hym of alle thynges, and many other that were be-falle. On the vj e day come thei to the kynge that hadde sein the\ndeth of this baron; and when they were come they\ntolde the kynge the merveile.  And than seide the kynge, and\nalle that herden ther-of, that ther was no-where so wise a man\nas Merlyn, and seiden fro thens-forth all that they myght\nhier hym speke or sey they wolde lete it be wreten.  And so\nbe-gan the boke of prophesies of Merlin, that spake of the\nkynges that sholde be in Engelonde, and of alle other thinges\nthat he spake of, and he knewe that alle his wordes sholde\nbe wreten.  He tolde to Blase, and Blase axed Merlin yef thei sholde make soche a-nother boke as he dide.  And he seide,\n\"Nay; for they shull write not elles but soche thinges as no\nman shall vndirstonde till it be fallen and passed.\"  And than\ncome Merlyn a-geyn to courte, and thei hym tolde the tydinges\nas he hadde not knowe ther-of. Than be-gan Merlin to speke so mystily, wher-of the boke\nof prophesyes is made.  And after come Merlin to the\nkynge and to Vter his brother, and seide to hem pitously, \"I love\nmoche yow and youre wurship; haue ye no mynde of the sarazins\nthat ye drive oute of the londe after the deth of Aungis?\"  And\nthei seide, \"Yesse, full wele; but why sey ye?\"  Quod Merlin,\n\"I sey for this: that they sey thei shull neuer fenisshe till thei\nhave a-vengid the deth of Aungis.  And thei have assembled a\ngrete power, and wele to conquere this londe be force.\"  When\nthe kinge and his brother herde this, thei merveiled gretly, and\naxed of Merlin, \"Haue thei so grete power to holde party a-geyn\noures?\"  And he ansuerde a-geyn, \"Euery man that ye haue\ndefensable, they have tweyne; therfore, but ye be wisly ruled,\nye shull be distroied, and lese youre reame.\"  Quod the kynge,\n\"We wilbe ruled be youre counseile.\"  And than he axed,\n\"When trowe ye that they shull come?\"  And Merlin seide,\n\"The xj day of Iuyne; and noon ne shall this knowe, saf ye\ntwo; and I deffende yow to speke ther-of, but do as I shall yow\ncounseile.  Sende after alle youre peple, and make hem the\ngrettest ioye and feste that ye may, and comaunde hem to be the\nlaste day of Iuyn, on the playn of Salisburye.\"  Than seide the\nkynge, \"Shall we suffer hem to aryve with-oute deffence?\"  And\nMerlyn seide, \"Ye; yef ye will do my counseile, and suffer hem\nto come as fer as ye may fro theire a-rivage; and so shall ye\nkepe hem two dayes, and thei shull haue grete dissese for lakke\nof water.  And the thirde day ye shull with hem fighten; and\nyef ye do thus, ye shull haue the victorye.\"  Than seide the\ntwo brethern, \"I pray yow telle vs yef eny of us shall dye in\nthat bataile.\"  And Merlin ansuerde, \"Ther is no-thynge that\nhath be-gynnynge, but it moste have endynge, ne no man ought\nto be dismayed of deth, to resceyve it as he oweth to do; and therfore I will that ye bringe the hiest reliques that ye haue,\nand ye shull bothe swere to do as I shall sey yow, for yowre\nprofite and youre worship, and than shall I boldely telle yow\nhow ye shulbe gouerned.\"  And thei swore as Merlin dide\ndevise.  And when thei were sworn, Merlin seide vnto hem,\n\"Ye haue sworne that in this bataile ye shull be gode men and\ntrue, a-gein god and youre-self.  Ne noon may be trewe to\nhymself but he first be trewe to god; and, loke ye, be trewly\nconfessed, for that ye shull fight a-geyn yowre enmyes; and after\nhaue no doute to ouercome theym, for thei have no bileve in the\ntrinite.  And wite ye wele that seth cristendom come first in to\nthis Ile, was neuer so grete bataile, ne neuer shall in youre\ntyme.  And also knoweth wele that the oon of yow two moste nede\npasse in this bataile; therfore eche man ordeyne for his moste\nworship that he can, a-geins that he cometh be-fore his\nlorde.  And that oon of yow most go to hym; and therfore goth in soche\nwise that ye may haue his love when ye come to his presence.\" Thus ended the counseile of Merlyn.  And the two brethern vnderstode what he hadde seyde, and sente after alle the\nestates of theire londe.  And when thei weren alle come, thei yaf\nhem grete yeftes.  And the kynge hem praide to make hem\ngarnysshed of their armes, and of horse; and also the laste woke\nof Iuyn to be redy, in the entre of the playnes of Salisbury,\nvpon the river of Tamyse, to diffende the reame.  And thus it\nlefte till the day that was somowned.  And the two brethern\na-geyn their burghes and townes made gode ordenaunce, as\nMerlin dide hem counseile.  And at Pentecoste thei heilde courte\nvpon the rivere, and there were many riche yestes.  Ther thei\nwere so longe, till thei herden that the Danoyse weren\na-rived.  Than the kynge sente to prelates of the chirche, that euery man\nof the oste sholde be confessed, and euery man to foryeven other,\nand be in charite and clene lyf.  Than seide Pendragon to\nmerlin that tydinges were come; the Sarazins weren\na-rived.  And Merlin seide it was trewe.  Than the kynge axed what was\nhis counseile to do.  And Merlin seide, \"Ye shall to-morowe\nsende thedir that oon half of youre peple; and when they be come from their a-rivage, than go be-twene hem and the aryvage;\nand youre peple shulde holde hem so shorte, that there ne shal\nbe noon of hem, but thei wolde fayn be ther as thei come\nfro.  And thus shull ye do two dayes, and the thirde day, whan ye se\na dragon all reade fleynge vp in the ayre, than boldly fight with\nhem, for ye shall haue the vyctorye.\" At this counseile were no mo but Pendragon and Vter.  And\nwhen thei hadde herde this thei were gladde.  And than\nseide Merlin, \"I will go; and be ye right sure of this that I haue\nyow seide, and thenke to be gode men and gode knyghtes.\"  Thus\nthei departed, and Vter made redy his felishep to go be-twene\nhem and the ryver.  And Merlyn come to hym, and seide,\n\"Thenke to do wele, and haue no drede, for thow shalt not dye\nin this bataile.\"  When Vter herde \u00feis he was gladde in\nherte.  Than Merlin wente to his maister Blase in Northumbirlonde, and tolde hym many thinges that he wrote in his boke.  Vter and\nhis peple rode till thei come be-twene the Danes and theire\nshippes, and kepte hem two dayes, that thei myght neuer\nryde.  The thirde day the kynge come so nygh that thet oon myght se\nthat other.  Whan the sarazins saugh the two hostes, thei were\ngretly dismayed, and sye wele that thei myght not repaire to their\nshippes with-oute grete bataile.  Than shewde the signe in the\nayre that Merlin hadde seide, and than the Danes hadden grete\ndrede.  And the kynge seide to his peple, \"Now vpon hem in\nall that we may.\"  And whan Vter saugh the kynges bataile,\nand the Danes assembled, he sette vpon hem as vigorously or\nmore.  In that bataile was grete mortalite on bothe parties, but\nthe hethen peple hadde moche the werse.  And ther Pendragon\ndide merveloise knyghthode a-monge his enmyes, and so dide\nVter; but I may not telle alle they well dedis.  But Pendragon\nwas ther deed, and many a-nother gode baron, wher-of was grete\npite and losse to the cristen partye.  And as the boke witnessith,\nVter venquysshed the bataille, and ther ne ascaped noon of the\nsarazins but that thei weren deed or taken.  And thus ended the bataile of Salisbury, wher-as Pendragon was deed.  And so all\nthe londe left hoill to Vter his brother.  He made geder alle the\ncristen that weren deed, and made hem to be beried in a place bi\nthem-self, and a-reised his brothers tombe moche hier than eny\nof the tother, and lete write vpon eche beryinge place his name\nthat lay vnder; but on his brother wolde he nought write, for he\nseide who that them be-heilde myght wele vndirstonde that he\nwas chief lorde.  Than Vter went to logres, and alle the prelates\nof the cherche, and ther was he sacred and crowned.  And thus\nwas Vter kynge of the londe after the deth of his brother\nPendragon.  And the quynsynne after that Merlyn come to courte,\nand grete was the ioye the kynge made to hym.  And than seide\nMerlyn to Vter, \"I will that thow haue surnonn of thi brother\nname; and for love of the dragon that appered in the ayre, make\na dragon of goolde of the same semblaunce.\"  And the kynge\ndide do make this dragon in all the haste he myght, like to the\ndragon that sewde in the ayre.  Than he lete sette it on a shafte\nin stede of a baner, and lete it be born be-fore hym in euery\nbataile at alle tymes when he sholde fight.  And thus was euer\nafter he cleped Vterpendragon.  And Merlyn a-bode with hym\nlonge tyme after, till on a day that Merlyn hym axed, \"Ne shall\nthow do no more to the place in the playn of Salesbury, wher-as\nthy brother is buried?\"  And the kynge ansuerde, \"What wilt\nthow that I do, for I will do euen as thow wilte devise?\"  Quod\nMerlin, \"I will that thow ordeyne ther soche a \u00feinge as shall\nendure to the worldes ende.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Telle me\nin what wise, and I will do it with gode will.\"  Than quod\nMerlin, \"Sende after the grete stones that ben in Irlonde, and\nmake hem to be brought in thy shippes, and I shall go to shewe\nthem which I will haue that thei shull brynge.\"  Than\nVterpendragon sente vesselles grete plente, and Merlin hem shewde the\nstones that were grete and longe, and seide, \"Lo, these ben the\nstones whiche ye ben come fore.\"  And when they hem saugh,\nthey it helde for a grete merveile, and seide it was a thynge\nunpossible to charge, they were of soche gretnesse and wight; and\nin their vessellis they seiden sholde they not come, yef god wolde.  And so thei returned to the kynge, and tolde the\nmerveile, and the kynge than seide, \"Suffer till Merlyn come.\" And when Merlyn was come, the kynge hym tolde like as his\nmen hadden seide, and Merlin seide, \"Sith it is so that\nthey may not hem hider bringe, I shall a-quyte me of my\npromyse.\"  And than Merlin made by crafte of his arte to bringe\nthe stones that weren in Irlonde to the playn of\nSalesbury.  And the kynge and moche peple wente to se the merveile; and\nwhen thei saugh the grete stones, thei seden that all the worlde\nne myght not hem remeve.  And Merlin badde they sholde be\ndressed vp-right, for thei sholde seme feyrer so than\nliggynge.  And the kynge seide that myght no man do, saf only god.  Than\nseide Merlyn, \"Let me worthen ther-with, and I shall a-quyte\nme of the couenaunt that I made.\"  And so all the labour lefte to\nMerlyn; and he dressed as thei be yet ouer the beryinge place of\nPendragon, and ben yet cleped the stonehenges.  And than come\nMerlin to Vterpendragon, and hym serued longe tyme and moche\nhym loved.  And so on a tyme he toke the kynge in counseile,\nand seide, \"Sir, I moste discure to yow the hiest counseile that\nye herde euer, and that thinge that I shall of speke shall be\nright straunge; and I requyre yow that ye it not discure to no\nman lyvynge.\"  And the kynge graunted his requeste.  Than\nseide Merlin, \"I will that ye wite that the knowinge that I\nhaue cometh be the enmy by nature; and oure lorde that is\nalmyghty a-bove alle thynge hath a-bove, that yove me witte and\nmemorye to knowe grete partye of thynges that be to come, and\nby this souereyn vertu the enmye hath me lorn that with the\nplesaunce of god they shull neuer haue power over me at her\nvolunte.  And sir, now ye knowe fro whens I haue this\npower.  And I will telle yow a thinge that god will that thow shalt\ndo.  And whan ye knowe what it is, loke ye, performe it to his\nplesier.  Sir, ye ought well to knowe that god come in to erthe to saue\nman-kynde, and also, as ye well knowe, he made a soper, and\nseide to hys apposteles, `Oon of yow shall me be-trayen.'  Sir, many provertees and grete suffraites suffred oure lorde her in\nerthe for oure sake, and many shames that the Iues hym diden;\nand after that he suffred bitter deth for vs upon the crosse; and\na knyght axed his body when he was deed vpon the seide crosse,\nand it was graunted hym of Pilate in lower of his servyse.\" \"Sir, it fill after that, this knyght whiche hadde taken oure\nlorde down of the crosse, that he was in a waste\ncontree full of diserte, and moche of his lynage.  And, sir, vpon\nhem fill a grete famyne and hunger, and thei complayned to the\nknyght that was thier maister.  And he prayde oure lorde to\nshewe his mercy to hem, and to shewe some demonstraunce, that\nthey myght be conforted of their grete disese.  And oure lorde\nhym comaunded to make a table, in the name of that table at the\nwhiche he was sette in the house of Symond leprouse, and bad hym\ntake the vessell whiche that he hadde, and sette it vpon the\ntable, and couer the table with white cloth, and also the vessell,\nall saue the parte toward hym.  Sir, this vessell was brought to\nthis seide knyght, by oure lorde Jhesu criste, whyle he was in\nprixon xl wynter, hym for to comforte.  And, sir, by this holy\nvessell were departed the company of gode and euell.  And also\nat this table was euer a voyde place, that betokeneth the place of\nIudas, ther as he satte at the soper, whiche he lefte whan herde\nthat oure lorde seide that worde for hym, whan he seyde that he\nthat ete with hym sholde hym be-trayen.  Thus lefte Iudas the\nplace voyde till that oure lorde set ther a-nother, that hight\nMatheu.  This Matheu was sette in that place to fille vp the\nnombre of xij apostles. Sir, this place that was voyde at the\ntable of Ioseph be-tokeneth the place that Matheu fulfilde; and,\nsir, thus be these two tables convenable.  And thus hath oure\nlorde filled the werke of man.  And, sir, the peple that were\nther-at cleped this vessell that thei hadden in so grete grace, the\nGraal; and yef ye do my counseile, ye shall stablisshe the thirde\ntable in the name of the trinite.  And I be-hote yow, yef ye do\nthis, ther-by shall come to yow grete honour and grete profite of\nyoure soule; and also it shalbe a thynge that moste shall be\nspoken of thourgh the worlde.\"  Thus seide Merlyn to Vterpendragon, wher-of he was well plesed, and seide to Merlin, \"I will\nthat oure lordes wille be performed in all that is in me, in all\nthinge that be to his wille; and all I putte in youre ordenaunce.\"\nAnd than was Merlyn gladde, and seide, \"Sir, loke where ye\nplese beste that it be sette.\"  \"Certes,\" quod the kynge, \"where\nas thow wilte, and ther as thow trowest it be moste oure lordes\nwille.\"  And Merlyn seide, \"It shall be at Cardoll, in Walys,\nand make ther thy feest at Pentecoste.  And array the to make\ngode chere, and to yeve grete yeftes; and I shall go be-fore, and\nmake the table, and whan thow arte come, I shall setten them\nthat owen ther-at to sitten.\"", "3": "CHAPTER IV. THE FEASTS AT CARDOELL; UTER-PENDRAGON'S LOVE FOR YGERNE, AND HIS WAR WITH HER HUSBAND, THE DUKE OF TINTAGEL. All as Merlyn devised dide the kynge, and warned thourgh all\nhis reame to be at Cardoell, in Walys, at the\nPentecoste.  And thus he lete crye thourgh all his reame, and Merlyn dide\nordeyne all that longed to the table.  The weke afore witsontyde\ncome the kynge to Cardoell, and when he was come he axed\nMerlin how he hadde spedde, and he seide, \"Wele.\"  Quod the\nkynge, \"What men shull ye chese to sitte at this table?\"  And\nMerlyn seide, \"Ye shull se to-morou that ye wende neuer to\nseen, that I shall chese fyfty of the beste knyghtes of this\nlonde.  And whan thei be ones sette, thei will haue no grete desire to\nreturne in to their contrees.  And thus ye may knowe whiche\nwere gode men and worthy, whan ye se the signifiaunce of the\nvoyde place.\"  Thus Merlyn, on the witsonday, chese fifty\nknyghtes, and comaunded hem to be sette at that table to mete;\nand thei so diden with gode chere.  And Merlyn that full of\nstronge arte, was yede hem aboute, and cleped the kynge as they\nweren sette, and shewed hym the voyde place.  And many othir it\nsyen, but they ne knewe not the tokenynge, ne why it was voyde. When Merlyn hadde don all thus, he badde the kynge that\nhe sholde go sitte; and thus they diden alle viij\ndayes.  And the kynge yaf grete yeftes to lordes, and to ladyes, and to\ndameseles.  And when they departed, the kynge come to the\nfyfty knyghtes, and axed how hem lyked.  And thei seyde,\n\"Sir, we haue no talent to remeve fro hens, and ther-of we haue\nmerveile what it maketh, for we be entred as brethern ; and\ntherfore we will neuer departe till deth vs departe.\"  When the\nkynge herde hem thus sey, he hadde grete merveile, and\ncomaunded hem to be serued, and kepte as his owne\nbody.  And thus departed the grete prese.  And than the kynge come\nto Merlyn, and seide, \"Truly thow seidest me soth that oure\nlorde wolde that this table sholde be stablisshed; but I wolde\npraye the to telle me yef thow knowe who shall fulfille the\nplace that is voyde.\"  And Merlyn ansuerde, \"Wite thow right\nwele that it shall not be in thy tyme; ne he that shall\na-complesshen, it is not yet be-geten.  But it shall be in the kynges\ntyme that shall come next after the; ne he that shall hym\nengendere shall not knowe that he shall hym engendere; and he that\nshall a-complysshe that sete must also complysshe the voyde\nplace at the table that Ioseph made.  And I pray yow therfore,\nthat euer hens-forth that ye hoilde alle youre grete festes in this\ntown.\"  \"Certes,\" quod the kynge, \"I will gladly.\"  And than\nseide Merlyn, \"Sir, I moste go, and of longe tyme ye shull not\nse me a-geyn.\"  And the kynge hym axed whider he sholde go;\nquod he, \"Shall ye not be here at alle tymes when I holde my\ngrete courte?\"  And Merlyn seyde, \"No.\" Than departed the kynge, and Merlyn yede to Blase, and\ntolde hym the stablisshement of this table, and many\nother thynges.  And thus a-bode Merlyn thre yere that he come\nnot to courte.  They that loved not Merlyn, but by semblaunce,\ncome to the kynge on a day as he was at Cardoell, and axeden\nhym of this voide place, and why there was not sette some\nworthy man, that the table myght be full.  And the kynge\nseide, \"Merlin tolde me a grete merveile, that seide noon myght it\na-complisshe in my tyme, ne yet ne ys he born, that shall engendre hym that shall it complesshen.\"  And thei lough ther-at,\nas they that weren full of envye, and seide, \"Sir, trowe ye that\nther shalbe better peple after youre tyme than beth now, and\nthat ther ne be now, as gode men in youre londe as thei shull be.\"\n\"Truly,\" seide the kynge, \"I wote neuer.\"  And thei seide,\n\"Ye do not wele but ye assaye.\"  \"Certes,\" quod the kynge,\n\"I will it not assaie, for I doute that Merlin wolde be wroth.\"\nAnd than they ansuerde, \"Yef ye wele yeve vs leve, we will\nassaye it, and for to preve the grete lesynge.\"  And the kynge\nseide, \"Ne were the drede I haue of the wrath of Merlyn, ther\nis nothynge that I desire so moche to assayen.\"  And they seide,\n\"Yef Merlyn be livynge, and he knowe that we will it assayen,\nhe will come with-oute faile, er eny man shall it assayen; but\nsuffre that we may it assaien at Pentecoste.\"  And the kynge\nhem graunted, wher-fore they weren gladde.  Thus it lefte till at\nwitsontyde, that the kynge hadde do warne alle his barons to be\nat his feste at Cardoell.  And Merlyn, that all thys wiste wele,\ntolde vn-to Blase the euell thoughtes that they hadden, that\nhadde take this enprise, and seide he wolde not go till he knewe\nwho sholde assaye to preve that place, for he hadde leuer haue it\npreve by a shrewe than a gode man.  Thus suffred Merlyn to the\nquynsyne of Pentecoste. Vterpendragon the kynge come to Cardoel, and brought with\nhym grete plente of peple.  And thei that were come\nfor to assaie the place made it to be seide that Merlyn was deed,\nand that he was founden in a wildernesse madde, and cherles\nhym kylde.  And so moche peple spake ther-of, that the kynge\nhym-self it leved; and more for that, he was so longe a-wey,\nthan for eny thinge elles, and, namely, he wende in no wyse he\nwolde not have suffred that eny man sholde haue assaide the\nvoyde place yef he were lyvynge. Thus was the kynge on\nwitson-even at Cardoel, and axed of hem that sholde it assaie,\nwhiche of hem sholde it do.  And he that all this hadde\nordeyned, seide, \"Sir, I will that ye wete ther shall noon\nassaie it but I.\"  Than he com to the table where as the\nfifty knyghtes weren sette, and seide, \"I am come to sitte with yow, and for to holde yow company.\"  And they ansuerde\nno worde, but full mekely be-helde what he wolde do.  And the\nkynge and grete partye of the barons weren ther\nassembled.  This sette hym down in the voyde place, and a-noon as he was\nsette, he sanke down as it hadde be leed, so that noon wiste\nwhere he was be-come.  Than the kynge comaunded alle the\nother gode men to aryse, and they so diden.  And than a-noon\nbe-gan so grete a noyse and sorowfull crye, that all the court\nwas trowbled; and the kynge hym-self was gretely\na-baisshed.  Thus they a-biden to the quynsyne after Pentecoste, that Merlin\ncome to courte.  And whan the kynge wiste of hys comynge, he\nwas right ioyfull, and wente hym a-geins to mete with\nhym.  And a-noon, whan Merlyn saugh the kynge, he seide he had euell\nspedde, to suffre eny man to sytte in that place.  \"Trewly,\"\nseide the kynge, \"I was disceyved thourgh here wordes.\"  \"In\nfeith,\" seide Merlyn, \"it falleth often to hem that wolden\nbegile, that thei be-giled hem-self; and that maist thow wele\nproven be this.\"  After the kynge axed, \"Yef he wiste where he\nwas be-comen that set hym in the sege?\"  And Merlin ansuerde,\n\"Therof no force is for to enquere, ne nought it sholde a-vayle\nfor to wite, but thenke on them that in \u00fee other places sitten,\nand to mayntene that thow haste be-gonne; and alle thy festes\nand alle thy courtes, come holde hem heir in this town, for to\nwurship this table, for thow knowest by the assay that thow\nhaste seyen that it is of grete dignite.  And now I go; now, loke\nthow do as thow haste seyde.\"  And thus departed the kynge;\nand Merlin comaunded the kynge to beilde feire howsynge, where\nhe sholde euer after holde his courte and his hye festes.  Than\nthe kynge lete it be knowen thourgh his reame that all high\nfestes, as Pasch and Pentecoste, and yole and halowmesse, sholde\nbe holden at Cardoel; and a-geyn the feste of yole, he somowned\nalle his barons, in soche maner that euerich of hem shulde brynge\nwith hem their wyves and doughtres, and her neces or\nsusteres.  And the knyghtes so diden alle.  I may not telle yow of alle tho\nthat ther weren, sef of hem that the tale reherses, oon after\na-nother.  Ther was the Duke of Tintagel, and Ygrine his wif; and hir the kynge loved gretly, but ther-of he made no\nsemblaunce, saf that often he be-heilde her more than a-nother;\nin-so-moche that hir-self it perceyved, and knewe that the kynge\nbe-helde her often.  And whan she it perceyved, she eschewed to\ncome in his presence, for she was right a gode lady, and full of\ngrete bewte, and right trewe a-geins hir lorde.  And the kynge\nfor her love, and for he sigh she hadde taken hede of his lokynges,\nhe sente Iuwelles to euery lady that was at the feste.  And to\nYgerne he sente as he trowed sholde beste hir plese, and she\nknewe and sigh wele that he hadde sente to alle other ladies, and\nther-fore she durste not refuse hirs, but receyved hem, and\nthought wele in her herte, that the kynge ne hadde not yeven to\nother ladyes, but for she sholde not refusen hirs. Thus hilde the kynge that feeste, that yet is with-outen wif,\nand was so supprised with the love of Ygerne, that he\nwiste not how to do, and thus departed the court; but firste the\nkynge praide alle the barons to be at Cardoel at Pasch, and so he\nprayed alle the ladies, and thei graunted to be ther.  Whan the\nDuke of Tintagel departed fro courte, the kynge hym conveyed\nand gretly hym honoured at theyr departynge; and whan he\nhadde hym a while conveied, he toke leve, and yede thourgh the\ncourte in his othir necessitees till that the tyme of Pasch, and\nthan gan to assemble alle the barons and all the ladyes at\nCardoel, and grete was the ioye that the kynge made, till it come to\nthe mete tyme that the kynge made the Duke of Tintagel to be\nset be-fore hym-self, and also his wif Ygerne, so that Ygerne ne\nmyght not eschewe but to resceve his yeftes, so that she it\naparceyved verily that the kynge hir loved, wherof she was\nright hevy, but ne she mot it suffer.  Thus was this feeste\nholden in grete ioye, and the kynge hem prayde to come at alle\ntymes whan he hem comaunded, and thei seiden so thei wolden\nas to theire souereyn lorde.  And thus departed the courte; and\nso endured the kynge in grete mysese for love of Ygerne, and at\nlaste he complayned hym-self to tweyne that he moche trusted\nof grete angwysshe that he suffred for the love of Ygerne, and\nthey seiden, \"What will ye that we shull do?\"  Quod the kynge, \"I wolde haue youre counseile, how I myght have her\ncompany.\"  And they seide, \"Yef ye go in to the courte ther as\nshe is, the peple shull it a-perceyve, and so myght ye be in\nblame.\"  And he seyde, \"What counseile yeve ye me thanne?\"\n\"The beste counseile,\" seide thei, \"that we se ther-inne is that\nye somowne a grete courte to be at Cardoel, and that ye make\nhem all to wite that it shall holde to the quynsine, and that eche\ncome araide to a-bide xv dayes, and eueriche man to brynge with\nhym his wyf.  And thus may ye have longe the company of\nYgerne, and haue grete counfort of youre love.\"  And the kynge\nwas plesed wele with her counseile, and sente to alle the barons\nto be at Pentecoste at Cardoel, and euery baron to brynge with\nhym his wif.  And as the kynge hem comaunded thei diden, and\nat that feeste the kynge bar crowne, and yaf grete yeftes to alle\nastates as hym semed beste sittynge. Gretly was the kynge at that feeste, and ioyfull and\nmery.  And he spake to oon of his counseile to whom he hadde\nmoste truste of eny other, and his name was Vlfyn.  And the\nkynge hym tolde of the grete peyne that he was Inne for the\nlove of Ygerne, that so hym constrayned that he myght nother\nete ne slepe, ne go, ne ride, and that he wende verily to dye whan\nhe was oute of her sight, and that he myght not longe lyve but\nhe hadde o\u00feer counseile of her love.  And Vlfyn seide, \"Sir, it is\na wonder thynge that for the delyte of a woman ye wene to\ndye.  And I am but a pore man, and yef I loved a woman so strongly\nas ye, I sholde not wene therfore to dyen.  Who herde euer\nspeke of eny woman, yef she were wele requereth, but ye sholde\nhaue of her youre volente; with that to yeve her gret yeftis Folio 22 is misplaced, and follows folio 23. and Juwels, and to hem that ben a-bouten hir.  I ne herde\nneuer speke of woman that cowde hir diffende a-geyn this; and\nthow that arte a kynge dismayest the so of feynt herte!\"  And\nthe kynge seide, \"Vlfyn, thow seyst right wele, and thow\nknowest wele what longeth to soche mystere; I pray the helpe\nme in alle maners that thow can or may, and take of my cofres what thow wilte, to yeve to alle that ben hir a-bouten, and speke\nso to hir as thow knowest is for my spede.\"  Quod Vlfyn, \"Be\nof gode counfort, for I shall do all my power.\"  And thus\nvndirtoke Vlfin to helpe the kynge.  And so all the xv dayes hilde the\nkynge grete feste, and euery day hadde the Duke in his company,\nand yaf hym a grete Iuwell, and also to his compers.  And\nVlfyn spake with Ygerne, and tolde hir many thinges that he\nmyght, as he trowed beste her plese; and many tymes he brought\nher a preciouse Iuwell; but Ygerne wolde noon of hem ,   till\non a tyme that Ygerne hilde Vlfyn in counseile, and seide,\n\"Vlfin, wherefore is it that ye wolde me yeve alle these\nIuwelles and these riche yeftes?\"  And Vlfin seide, \"Madame,\nfor youre grete wisdome, and youre grete beaute and faire\ncontenaunce, I may noght yeve yow, for all erthely gode is yours, and\nalle the londe of logres, and alle the mennes bodyes at youre\nplesier to do youre volente.\"  And she ansuerde, \"How?\"\n\"How?\" quod he, \"for ye haue the herte of hym to whom alle\nmoste obbeye.\"  Quod she, \"Whos herte is that ye of speken?\"\nAnd Vlfyn seide, \"Of the kynge.\"  And she lifte vp hir hande,\nand hir fayned, and seide, \"A mercy god! sholde eny knyge be\ntraytour, so as he maketh semblaunce to myn husbonde of love,\nand so shamefully wolde me diffoule!  Vlfin, now be right well\nware that thow neuer speke to me more of these wordes, ffor,\nwite thow wele, I shall telle my lorde, and yef he it knowe\nthow moste dye.\"  And Vlfyn ansuerde, \"That were to me\ngrete wurship, yef I sholde dye for my lorde; ne neuer lady\nthat refused a kynge in soche wyse as do ye, that loveth yow\nmore than eny other thynge.  And I trowe ye do but iape; but\nfor goddes love haveth pite of the kynge that is youre lorde, and\nalso vpon youre self, for yef ye haue no mercy of this thynge,\nwiteth wele that ther-of may come grete harme, ne ye ne youre\nlorde may not yow diffende a-geyn the kynges wille.\"  And\nYgerne ansuerde, wepynge, \"I shall therfore me right wele\ndiffende, for I will neuer come in place wheras he may me\nseen.\" And so departed Ygerne; and Vlfin come to the kynge, and\ntolde hym like as she hadde seide.  And the kynge\nseyde so sholde a gode lady ansuere, for ther was neuer gode\nlady that lightly wolde be ouercome; and therfore he ne cessed\nnot of prayinge.  And on the xi e iour of Pentecoste, the kynge\nsatte at mete, and with hym te Duke of Tintagel.  And the\nkynge hadde a riche cowpe of goolde; and Vlfyn kneled be-fore\nthe kynge, and seide, \"Sir, sende this cuppe to Ygerne, and\npraye the Duke to bidde hir to take it, and drynke for youre\nlove.\"  And the kynge cleped the Duke, and badde hym sende\nthat cuppe to Ygerne, his wif, and sende hir worde to drynke\nfor his love.  And the Duke ansuerde as he that thought noon\neuell, and seyde, \"Sir, gramercy.\"  The Duke cleped a knyght\nof his owne that he loved well, \"Bertel, take this cuppe, and\nbere to thy lady, and sey her that she drynke for the kynges\nlove.\"  And Bretel cam in to the chamber where Ygerne sat at\nmete amonge othir ladyes, and kneled be-fore hir, and seide,\n\"Madam, the kynge sente yow this cuppe, and my lorde\ncomaundeth that ye sholde it take, and also to drynke for the kynges\nsake.\" Whan the lady vndirstode these wordes, she wax all reade\nfor shame, but she durste not refuse the comaundement\nof hir lorde, but toke the cuppe, and dranke, and wolde have\nsente it a-geyn be the same knyght.  And he seide, \"My lorde\nsente yow worde ye sholde it kepe, for so the kynge hym prayde.\"\nWhen she sye that, she sigh wele that nedes she muste kepe the\ncuppe.  And Bretell come a-gein, and thanked the kynge on\nYgernes be-halfe, that ther-of hadde seide no worde.  And glad\nwas the kynge that she hadde resceyved his yefte.  And Vlfin\nwente in to the chamber, to se what semblaunce she made, and\nhe fonde hir pensif and angry.  And whan she saugh Vlfin, she\ncleped hym to hir, for the bourdes weren vp, and seide, \"Vlfyn,\nthourgh grete treson thy lorde hath here sente me a cuppe, but\ntherby shall he gete litill wurschip er to-morow day, for I will\ntelle my lorde of the treson that ye be-twene yow two haue\npurposed.\"  And Vlfyn ansuerde, \"Be-war ther-of, that it yow neuer passe.\"  And she seide, \"Mysauenture have that it kepeth\neny counseile.\"  With that departed Vlfyn from hir.  And be\nthan the kynge hadde waisshe, and was right mery and gladde,\nand toke the Duke be the hande, and seide, gowe, se these\nladyes.  Than they yede to the chamber wher as Ygerne hadde\neten; and she knewe wele that he come for noon othir cause but\nfor hir.  And so she suffred all the day till the nyght, and\nthan she wente hom to hir loigynge.  And when the Duke come\nhe fonde hir wepynge and makynge grete sorow; wherfore he\nwas right hevy, and toke hir in his armes, as he that moche hir\nloved, and axed whi she made soche sorowe.  \"Trewly,\" quod\nshe, \"ther nothynge that I will kepe from yow counseile, for\nther is nothynge that I love so moche as yow.  The kynge that\nis my lorde and yowres seith that he loueth me, and alle these\ncourtes that ye se hym holde, and alle these ladyes that he\nsendith fore, it is nought elles but for me, and that ye sholde\nbrynge me with yow.  And these othir tymes I parceyved it wele\nI-nough, and I me kepte bothe fro hym and from his\nyeftes.  And so hiderto I haue me wele deffended, that I haue nought\ntaken of his.  And now haue ye made me to take a cuppe, and\nsente me that I sholde drynke for his love.  And therfore I\nwolde I were deed, for I may neuer haue reste for hym, and\nVlfyn hys counseiller.  And now I haue tolde yow all as it is;\nI knowe wele that ther-of muste come more anger, wherfore I\nbeseke yow, as I ought to do my lorde, that ye brynge me to\nTintagel, for I will no lenger a-bide in this town.\"  Whan the Duke,\nthat moche loved his wif, herde this, he was als wroth as eny\nman myght be.  Than he sente after his men thourgh the town,\nand when they were come, he seide to hem prevely, \"Make yow\nredy for to ride in all haste, so that no man of the town it wyte, and axed not the cause why till I telle yow.\"  And thus the\nDuke and his knyghtes lepe to horse, and rode home to his contre,\nand ledde with hym his wyf. On the morowe, whan the kynge wiste the Duke was thus\ni-gon, he was hevy and sorowfull for that he hadde ledde\na-wey Ygerne, and sente after his counseile, and shewde hem the shame and the dispite the Duke hadde hym don.  And they seide\nthey merveyled ther gretly, and that hadde don grete\nfolye.  Thus seide they that wiste not why he was gon.  And the kynge\nseide, \"As ye haue sen alle, I haue do to hym more wurship\nthan to eny othir.\"  And they seiden, \"It was soth; wherfore\nwe gretly merveyle why he hath don so grete outerage.\"  And\nthe kynge seide, \"Yef it be youre rede I will sende after hym\nthat he come a-geyn and a-mende this forfet, and that in the same\nwise as he is gon that he come a-gein, for that me semeth is\nright.\"  And the counseile ther-to assented.  On this massage\nwas sente two worthy men fro the kynge, and rode till they\ncome to Tintagell, and ther they fonde the Duke, and tolde hym\ntheir message as they weren charged.  Whan the Duke herde\nthat in the same forme he moste come a-geyn, he vndirstode\nwele he sholde bringe with hym Ygerne, and than he seide to\nthe messagers, \"I ne will not come at his courte, for he hath\nso don to me and to myne that I owe hym neyther to truste ne\nto love.\"  And thus departed the messagers with-outen other\nansuere.  And than the Duke sente after alle the worthy men of\nhis counseile, and seide hem the cause why he was come fro\nCardoel, and the vntrouthe and the shame that the kynge hadde\nhym purposed.  And they ther-of merveileden gretly, and seide\nthat sholde neuer be-tyden with goddes grace, and wele oughten\nhe to haue shame that this shame hath purposed to his liege\nman.  Thanne seide the Duke, \"I pray yow, and requyre be the\nfeith that ye me owen, that ye helpe me to diffende my londe\nyef he me assawte with werre.\"  And thei ansuerde that so\nwolde they do to put alle ther lyves and gods in\nIepardye.  Thus the Duke counseiled with his men.  And the messagers\ncome to Cardoel and fonde the kynge and his barons, and tolde\nas the Duke hadde yeve hem ansuere; and they seiden alle, thei\nmerveiled of the Duke, that was wonte to be so wise a man, and\nso had him ruled.  The kynge praide his barons, and hem\nrequyred as his liege men, that thei wolde hym helpe to redresse\nthat forfet, and a-venge the shame that he hadde hym don; and\nthey seiden that they myght not that refusen; but thei seiden yef it were hys plesier to sende, knowynge that he hym diffied,\nxl dayes be-fore er he hym assailed.  And the kynge seide that\nwolde he do; but the kynge hem praide that at the ende of xl\ndayes they be redy assembled ther he hem assigned arayed for to\nosteye.  The kynge sente his messagers for to diffie the Duke of\nTintagel; and when the Duke herde that he hym diffied at the\nende of xl dayes, he seide he sholde hym diffende yef he\nmyght.  And than he sente to his peple, and shewde hem the diffiaunce of\nthe kynge, prayinge hem to helpe hym in that grete\nmister.  And they seide thei sholde hym helpe with all their\npower.  And than the Duke counseiled with his peple, and seide, \"I\nhave but two castelles that a-gein the kynge may holde; but tho\ntweyne wolde he holde as longe as he hadde lyf.\"  And he\ndevised to leve his wif at Tintagel, and with hir x knyghtes, for\nhe knewe that castell hadde no doute of no man, and hym-self\nwente to a-nother castell that was of lesse strengthe, and it stuffed\nin the beste wise that he myght, and seide that he myght not his\nother londes agein hym diffende.  The messagers that hadde the\nDuke diffied come to the kynge, and seide how the Duke wolde\nhym diffende.  Thanne the kynge sente to somowne his barons\nand his peple, and made hem alle to assemble in the Dukes londe\nin a grete medowe vpon a rivere.  Whan the barons were\nassembled, the kynge to hem rehersed the grete dispyte of brekynge of\nhis courte, and the barons seiden it was reson that the forfet\nwere redressed.  Thus the kynge lefte in the Dukes londes, and\ntoke his castelles and his townes, and distroyed all the contre,\nand than the kynge herde sey that Ygerne was at Tintagel, and\nthe Duke in a-nother castell, and than the kynge axed of his\ncounseile whiche castell he sholde firste assaile; and the barons\nyaf hym counseile firste to assaile the Duke, and therto the\nkynge graunted.  And so thei rode to the castell that the Duke\nwas ynne; and than the kynge seide to Vlfin, \"What may I do\nwhan I ne may not se Ygerne?\"  And Vlfyn seide, \"The\nthinges that a man may not haue, he muste nede suffer; and\ntherfore ye must put to grete besynesse to take the Duke, for\nafter that ye shall well to purpos bringe the remenaunt.\" Many assaute made the kynge at the Castell, but he cowde\nit in no wise gete, wher-fore he was full of sorowe, and\nright Irouse.  And on the tother side he was sore distreined\nwith the love of Ygerne, that on a tyme, as he was in his\npavilyon, he gan to wepe.  Whanne his peple saugh hym wepe, they\nweren hevy, and hem with-drowen, and leften hym a-lone.  And\nwhan Vlfin it wiste ther-of, he come anoon, and axed the kynge\nwhy he wepte.  And the kynge seide, \"Thow knowest wele\nwherfore, for thow woste wele that I dye full of loue of Ygerne,\nfor I have loste bothe mete and drynke, and all reste that a man\nought to have.\"  And whan Vlfyn this vndirstode, he seide,\n\"Ye be of ful febill herte whan ye thynke to dye for oon sole\nwoman; but I shall sey yow gode counseile.\"  \"What is that?\"\nseide the kynge.  \"That ye wolde sende to seche Merlin, that he\nmyght come to yow, and it myght noon other-wise be, but that he\nsholde yeve yow some gode counseile that sholde yow\nprofite.  And ye shull hym yeve what he will desire.\"  And than seide\nthe kynge, \"Ther is no thynge that is possible to a man but that\nhe can it do; but I wote wele Merlin of my distresse knoweth,\nand so I am in drede that he be wroth for the voide place of the\ntable, that I suffred to be assaide.  And longe tyme it is passed\nsethe he was in place, where-as I myght hym se.  And also I\ntrowe he is not well plesed that I love the wif of my liege man;\nbut trewly I may not do ther-to, ne I ne may not therfro me\ndeffende.  But I have well in mynde that he badde I sholde not\nsende hym for to seche.\"  And Vlfin ansuerde, \"I am in certeyn\nof oon thynge, that he farith well and is in hele.  Yef he love\nyow as he was wonte to do, he knoweth what distresse that ye\nbeth ynne, and it shal not be longe er ye here of hym\ntydynges.\" Thus Vlfyn counforted the kynge, and counseiled hym to\nsende for his meyne to hym, and that sholde cause hym\nto foryete a grete partie of his sorowe.  And the kynge seyde\nso he wolde do; but his love myght he, ne his sorow in no maner\nwise for-gete.  Thus the kynge peyned to conforte hym-self\nand his peple, and made the castell to be assailed; but take it they myght not in no wise.  And on a day, as Vlfin rode\nthourgh the oste, he mette with a man that he nothinge\nkenned.  And he seide, \"Vlfin, I wolde fain speke with the.\"  And\nthanne they yede oute of the hoste, the man on his fete, and\nVlfyn on horsebak.  And Vlfin light down on foote to speke with this man, and hym axed what he was.  And he seide,\n\"I am an olde man, as thow maist se, and som tyme in my\nyowthe I was holden wise; and now of moche thinge that I sey\nmen sein that I dote; but I sey to yow in counseile that I was\nat Tintagel not longe sithe, and ther I was a-queynted with a\ngode man, that tolde me that youre kynge loueth the Dukes wif,\nand that is the cause that the kynge distroyeth his contre, for\nhe brought his wif fro Cardoel.  And yef ye and the kynge\nwill wele quyte my nede, I shall make yow a-queynte with a\ngode man that shall make yow speke mith Ygerne, and that shall\nwele counseile the kynge of his desir.\"  When Vlfyn herde\nthis man so say, he merveled who that hym sholde haue tolde,\nand prayde him that he wolde teche hym to that man that\ncowde counseile the kynge of his desires.  And the olde man\nseide, \"I will first here what rewarde the kinge will yeve.\"\nQuod Vlfin, \"Where shall I yow fynde when I haue spoke with\nthe kynge?\"  The olde man seide, \"Ye shull finde me or my\nmessage be-twene this and the hoste.\"  And so he hym\ncomaunded to god, and bad hym come on the morowe, and hym\nwolde telle soche tydinges as sholde hym plese.  And Vlfin com\nto the kynge as hastely as he myght, and tolde how the olde\nman hadde seide.  And whan the kynge hadde herde these\nwordes, he lowgh and made feire semblaunce, and seide to Vlfin,\n\"Knowest thow ought the man that thow spake with?\"  And\nhe ansuerde, \"It is a man right olde and feble.\"  And the kynge\nseide, \"Whan shull ye mete este to-geder?\"  And Vlfyn seide,\n\"In the morowe, for he badde me wite of yow what he shulde\nhaue to rewarde.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Lede me thider as\nthow shalt mete with hym.\"  And Vlfin seide, \"With gode\nwill; and yef thow speke with hym with-oute me, profer hym\nwhat he will desire of myn.\"  Thus thei leften till on the morowe; but that nyght was the kynge merier than he hadde\nben eny tyme be-fore. The morowe after masse the kynge and Vlfyn rode forth as\nVlfin wolde hym guyde; and as thei issued oute of the\nhoste thei sye a crepell that semed blinde; and as thei passed\nforth by hym, he cried with an high voyce, \"Sir kynge, so god\na-complesshe thyn hertys desire of that thow desirest moste to haue,\nso yeve me som thynge that I may conne the thanke fore.\" And\nthe kynge be-heilde Vlfyn, and seide lawghinge, and seide, \"Vlfyn,\n\"Do that I shall comaunde the for my grete profite, and for my\nlove, and for to compleisshe my grete desire.\"  And Vlfyn seide,\n\"Ther is nothinge that I desire so moche, as for to do that myght\na-complisshe youre desire.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Hast thow\nnought herde what the Crepell axed, that I sholde remembre\nthe thinge that I beste loved in this worlde, and that I am moste\ndesiraunte.  Go and sette the a-down by hym, and sey \u00feat I\nhaue sente the to hym, and ther is nothinge in this worlde that I\nhaue in possession, but that I wolde come to yeve it hym, yef I\ndurste come to se hym.\"  And Vlfin, with-oute eny grucchynge,\nyede and yaf hym-self to the Crepill, and sette hym down by\nhym.  And whan the crepill felte Vlfyn, he axed what he was,\nand what he was come for to seche.  And he ansuerde, \"The\nkynge hath sente me to yow, and that I sholde euer be youres.\"\nAnd whan the crepill that herde, he lowgh, and seide to Vlfyn,\n\"The kynge is sone perceyvinge, and me knoweth better than do\nye.  I will that thow wite that the olde man that thow spake\nwith yesterday sente me to the; but I will not telle the what he\nseyde.  Go to the kynge, and sey he wolde do a grete thynge for\nto haue his desire, and that I sende hym worde that sone he is\nparceyvinge, and he shall spede the better.\"  And Vlfin seide,\n\"I dar nought aske what ye ben.\"  \"Aske the kynge,\" quod\nthe crepill, \"and he shall telle the wele i-nough.\"  And Vlfyn\nlepe on horse, and priked after the kynge.  And whan the kynge\nsaugh hym come, he drough a-side, and seide, \"Vlfyn, is it that\nthow art come after me; ne have I not yove the to the Crepill?\"\nQuod Vlfin, \"He seith that ye be sone aperceyvaunte of hym, and that ye sholde telle me what he is, for he wolde not telle me, but\nseide ye sholde telle wele i-nough.\"  Than seide the kynge,\n\"Wost thow what olde man that was that spake with the\nyesterday?  that same is this that thow haste seyn a crepill.\"  And\nVlfyn seide, \"May this be true, that oon man may hym-self thus\ndisfigure?  And what is he than that thus hym disfigureth?\"\nAnd the kynge ansuerde, \"Knowe it verily it is Merlin, that\nthus hym kepeth fro yow.  And whan he will, he will make yow\nwele to knowe that it is thus.\"  Thus they passed forth thourgh\nthe feilde; and Merlin come in his right semblaunce in to the\nkynges teynte, and asked where was the kynge.  And a\nmessanger come to the kynge, and seide Merlin was come; and than was\nthe kynge so gladde that he myght not ansuere, but in all haste\nreturned, and cleped Vlfyn, and seide, \"Now shalt thow knowe\nyef it be so as I haue seide, for Merlyn is comen, and I knowe\nwele that he doth not seke me for nought.\"  And than seide\nVlfyn, \"Now shall it be sene yef euer ye were ought wroth, and\nyef ye can other do well or sey to his plesire of alle thinges; for\nther is no man that may yow helpe so wele to haue the love of\nYgerne.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Thow seiste soth, and ther is\nno thynge that he doth comaunde me but I shall it gladly\nperforme.\" Thus thei rode till thei come to the teynte where as thei\nfonde Merlin, and the kynge hym made grete ioye and\nmery chere, and ran hym a-gein with armes spred a-brode, and\nhym halsed and seide he was the man in all the worlde that was\nmoste to hym welcome; and than he seide, \"Wherto sholde\nI me complayne vn-to yow, for as ye it knowe as my-self, and\nther was neuer man that I longed so sore after, and I pray yow\nand requyre telle me of that ye knowe my herte desireth so.\"\nAnd Merlin seide, \"Of that ye me asken I shall not speke\nwith-oute Vlfyn.\"  Than made the kynge to clepe after Vlfin, and\ndroughen hem a-side in counseile.  Than seide the kynge to\nMerlin, \"I haue tolde Vlfin of that ye comaunded, and that ye\nwere the olde man that he sigh yesterday, and also the crepill\nthis day.\"  And Vlfyn be-heilde hym strongely, and seide, \"May this be trewe that the kynge seith?\"  And Merlin seide, \"Ye,\nit is trewe with-outen faile; and as sone as I saugh he sente the\nto me I wiste well he hadde me perceyved.\"  And than Vlfyn\nseide to the kynge, \"Sir, now sholde ye speke of youre gref, and\nnot wepe whan ye ben soill.\"  And the kynge seide, \"I wote\nnot what to sey ne preyen:  he knoweth well my corage, and I\nmay not make hym no lesynge, but he it knowe as wele as I;\nbut I pray hym hertely to helpe me to haue the love of Ygerne,\nand he ne shall devise nothinge that is to me possible but that I\nshall it gladly don.\"  And Merlin seide, \"Yef ye will graunte\nme that I shall aske, I shall purchace yow hir love, and make\nyow to ly in here chamber and in hir bedde, bothe naked.\"  And\nVlfyn that herde, he lough and seide, \"Now shall I se what a\nmannes herte is worth.\"  And the kynge seide to Merlin, \"Ye\ncan not aske me nothinge that be founden in this worlde, but I\nsholde it yow yeven.\"  And Merlin ansuerde, \"How may I\nhere-of be sure, but yef ye be sworn, and also lete Vlfyn swere,\nthat I shall haue that I aske on the morn that ye haue leye with\nYgerne, and don with hir youre beste?\"  And the kynge seide,\n\"That wolde he do with gode will.\"  And Merlin asked Vlfyn\nyef he wolde swere, and Vlfyn seide, \"That me for-thinketh, for\nI was neuer yet sworn in no tyme.\" When Merlin herde that worde, he lough and seide, \"Whan\nyoure othes be made, I shall telle yow how it shall be.\"\nThan the kynge made be brought the hiest seintewaries that he\nhadde, and the beste relikes, and ther-on they dide swere as\nMerlin dide hem devyse, and thei seiden thei sholde it feithfully\nholde with-outen fraude or mal engyn.  After the kynge swore\nVlfyn, and thus hath Merlin taken their othes.  And than seide\nthe kynge, \"Merlin, now I requere yow sone to helpe myn\nhertes desire, as the man of all the worlde that moste ther-after\nlongeth to haue it complisshed.\"  And than seide Merlyn, \"Ye\nmuste be wisely demened, for she is a trewe lady and full wise,\nand trewe to god and to hir lorde; but now shall ye se what\npower I haue hir to be-gile, for I shall make yow semblaunce of\nthe Duke so wele, that ther is no man that yow doth sen but he shall wene it be the Duke.  And two knyghtes that ben moste\nprivy with hym, that noon ne knoweth so moche of his counseile,\nnot Ygerne her-silf; and that oon hight Bretell, and that other\nIordan; and I shall haue the semblaunce of Bretel, and Vlfin\nshall be like Iordan, and so shall I make hem to open the gates\nof the castell, and we shull alle thre ly with-Inne; but full erly\non the morow we moste gon oute, for er we departe thens we\nshall here straunge tidinges, and therfore a-ray youre oste and\nyour barons, and comaunde hem to make gode wacche to\ndiffende hem-self, and that noon of hem ne go towarde the castell\ntill that ye be come a-geyn, and be well ware that ye telle no\ncreature wheder that ye shall go.\"  And Vterpendragon dide as\nMerlin hadde devised, and a-noon com agein, and seide that he\nwas redy, and Merlin seide how he was also redy, \"there is not\nellis but to spede vs forward,\" and so thei wenten forth alle thre\ntill thei com ner at Tintagell, and than seide Merlyn to the\nkynge, \"A-byde ye here, and I and Vlfyn shall go this wey.\"\nAnd than eche drough a-side by hym-self; and whan thei were\ndisseuered, and Merlin hadde don his art, he toke an herbe, and\nbrought it to the kynge, and seide, \"Frote youre visage with this\nherbe, and youre handes.\"  And the kynge toke the herbe, and\nrubbid his handes, and his visage, and his feet; and anoon, as he\nhadde thus I-don, he hadde aperteliche the semblaunce of the\nDuke.  And than seide, Merlyn, \"Haue ye eny mynde that euer\nye saugh Iordan?\"  And the kynge seide, \"Ye, I knowe hym\nwele.\"  And Merlyn com to Vlfyn, and transfigured hym to the\nsemblaunce of Iurdan, and than sente hym to the kynge.  And\nwhan the kynge saugh Vlfyn, he hym blissed, and seide, \"Mercy\ngod!  how may eny man make oon man so like a-nother?\"  And\nthan he seide to Vlfyn, \"How semeth the be me?\"  And Vlfyn\nseide, \"I knowe yow nought but for the Duke.\"  And the kynge\nseide, he was verily like vn-to Iurdan.  And as thei stoden, so\nthei be-heilde Merlyn, and thei semed verily it was Bretel.  And\nthus thei speken to-geder, and taried till it was nyght, and in the\nevenynge thei come to the Castell gate.  And Merlyn, that wele\nresembled to bretel, cleped the porter, and the peple com to the gate, and saugh apertly the Duke, as hem semed; and thei seide,\n\"Open: lo, here the duke.\"  And thei dought it was Bretel and\nIurdan, and whan thei weren entred, Bretel diffended, \"that no\nman in the place sholde not wite that the Duke was comen.\"\nI-nowe ther were that yede to telle the Duchesse.  And Merlyn\ntoke the kynge in counseile, and seide that he sholde contene\nhym-self myrily.  And a-noon alle thre thei come be-fore the\nchambir where Ygerne that yet was in her bedde; and in all haste\nthat thei myght, thei mad their lorde redy.  And so he yede to\nbedde to Ygerne; and that nyght he gat vpon hir the gode kynge\nthat after was cleped Arthur.  The lady made grete ioye of the\nkynge, for she wende verily it hadde ben the Duke hir lorde,\nthat she loved moche with a trewe herte.  Thus thei lay to-geder,\ntill on the morowe, in the dawenynge, the tidinges com in to\nthe town that the Duke was dede, and also his stewarde\nI-take.  And than thei com full previly in; and when these other tweyn\nthat tho were a-risen, herde these tidynges, thei ran ther as their\nlorde lay, and seide, \"A-ryse vp, and go to youre castell, for\nther be soche tydinges come hider, that oure peple wene that\nye be deed.\"  And he lepe vp, and seide, \"It is no merveyle\nthough they wene so; ffor I yede oute of the castell that no man\nknewe ther-of no worde.\"  A-noon he toke leve of Ygerne, and\nhir kiste, seynge hem alle at her departynge.  And thus they\ndeparted oute of the castell in all the haste they myght, that\nneuer oon ne knewe but it was the Duke.  And whan they\nweren oute, thei weren right gladde.  And Merlyn seide to the\nkynge, \"Sir, haue ye kept wele the couenaunte comen\u00f1t now, loke thow\nkepe as wele myne.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Ye sey trewe, for\nye haue don me the beste servise that euer man dide to a-nother;\nand therfore youre couenauntes shall I well holde.\"  And Merlyn\nseide, \"I hem aske now, and will that they be holden.\"  And the\nkynge seide, \"I am redy hem to performe.\"  And than seide\nMerlyn, \"I will that thow knowe that thow haste engendred an\nheyre male on Ygerne, and that hast thow me yoven; and therfore I shall write the houre and the day in the whiche it is\nbegeten, and so shalt thow knowe yef I sey soth.\"  Quod the\nkynge, \"As thow hast seide, I haue sworn, and I yeve it the\nwith gode will.\" Thus they rode till they come to a rivere, and ther Merlyn\ndid hem waisshen, and than hadde thei semblaunce as\nthat thei hadden be-fore.  And than the kynge rode forth as faste\nas he myght; and as sone as he was come his barons and his\npeple gedered a-boute hym.  And he hem asked how the Duke\nwas deed.  And thei hym tolden, \"The day when ye were\ndeparted the oste was stille and koye; and therby the duke\nvndirstode that ye were not in the oste, and dide his peple to\narme, and come vpon vs, and dide vs grete damage er we\nmyghten ben armed.  The cry a-rose and the noyse, and oure\nmeynee hem arayde, and set on hem, and drof hem a-geyn, even\nbe-fore the yate.  And ther the duke a-bode, and dide many\nmaistries in armes.  And ther was his horse slayn and the Duke\nouerthrowe, and ther was he deed amonge oure peple on foote,\nthat hym nought knewen.  And we driven the remenaunt in at\nthe yates, that sympilly hem deffended whan they hadde loste\ntheir lorde.\"  And the kynge seide he was right sory for the\ndeth of the Duke.", "4": "CHAPTER V. MARRIAGE OF THE KING WITH YGERNE; BIRTH OF ARTHUR; AND DEATH OF THE KING. Thus was the Duke of Tintagel deed, and the castell\nloste.  The kynge spake to his barons, and seide that sore hym\nfor thought the myschaunce of the Duke.  And the kynge toke\na-visement of his counseile how he myght this thinge\na-mende.  And his barons ne blamede hym nought, though he did not hate\nthe duke dedly, and that he were hevy for the\nmysauenture.  \"Truly,\" seide the kynge, \"to my power I wolde fain make the a-mendes.\"  Than spake Vlfyn, and seide, \"Sir, seth this\na-venture is thus be-fallen, it moste be a-mended in the beste wise it\nmay.\"  Than Vlfyn toke a-part the barons, and seide, \"How\nseme ye that this myght be amended a-geyn the lady and a-geyn\nthe Dukes frendes, wherof the kynge asketh yow counseile.  And\nye moste counseile hym the beste to youre power as youre lorde.\"\nAnd thei seiden, \"We wolde gladly rede hym the beste, and\ntherfore we pray yow to yeve vs counseile for oure moste\nwurschip how we myght beste be demened in this matere, that the\nkynge forsake not oure counseile; for we knowe wele that ye are\nwell in his grace.\"  And Vlfyn seide, \"Yef I be wele in his\ngrace, trow ye that I sholde counseile a thynge be-hynde hym\nthat I sholde not sey be-fore hym; than holde ye me for a\ntray-tour yef I sholde be soche.  And yef the pees and the\na-mendement to the lady lay in me, I wolde rede hym soche thinges that\nye ne durste not thynken.\"  And they seide, \"We trowe yow\nwele, and wele we knowe that ye be wise and trewe, and of\ngode counseile; and therfore we pray yow to connseile vs what\nwere beste to requere the kynge ynne, after that we have sein\nand knowe verily.\"  And Vlfin seide, \"I shall sey yow myn\navise, and yef ye can better, sey it ye.  I rede the kynge sende\nafter alle the Dukes frendes, and that the kynge go to Tintagel,\nand make alle the ladies frendes to come also be-fore hym.  And\nwhan they beth come be-fore hym, that he profer for the pees\nand a-mendes for the Dukes deth, that yef they it refusen, that\nthei be holde for foles, and he for a wise man and a trewe.  In\nthis wise, he that wele haue pees, it moste be made.\"  And thei\nthat were wise seide, \"We holde vs to youre counseile, ne neuer\nfor vs shall he haue other.\"  Than they come be-fore the kynge,\nand seiden the counseile that thei hadde founden; but thei ne\nseide not that Vlfyn hadde it hem yoven, for so he hem hadde\npraide and required.  And \u00feus as he hadde hem enformed they\nseide be-fore the kynge.  And the kynge seide to this, \"I a-corde\nme well, and will that it be so as ye haue devised.\"  And than\nthe kynge sente to alle the Dukes kenrede, and alle by letteres,\nthat thei sholde come to hym to Cardoel, and yaf gode trewys , and that he sholde a-mende alle the fautes wherof thei cowde hem\ncomplayne.  Thus seide the kynge be-fore alle his barons, and so\ndeparted fro the castell.  And Merlin com to the kynge, and seide,\n\"Wite ye who hath yove this counseile that ye haue\ncomaunded.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Nay, but that the nobill men and wise\nme dide reden.\"  And Merlyn seide, \"Amonge hem alle thei\ncowde nought haue dought this rede, but Vlfyn that is wise and\na trewe knyght hath ordeyned all this pees, and the beste\nordenaunce that eny can thynke.  And wite it wele that no man\nknoweth it, saue he and ye and I that he hath it seide.\"  And\nthan seide the kynge to Merlyn, \"And how rede ye of this\nthinge?\"  Quod Merlin, \"I knowe no better counseile, ne more\ntrewe; and so shalt thow a-complisshe thy desere of thyn herte\nthat thow art moste desiraunt.  And now I muste go, but first I\nshall speke with the be-fore Vlfyn.  And whan I am go, thow\nmaiste aske Vlfin how he hath dought in makynge of this\npees.\"  And the kynge seide so wolde he don. Than was Vlfin cleped; and whan he was come be-fore them\ntwo, Merlyn seide to the kynge, \"Ye haue yove me be\nyour power the heyer that ye haue be-geten, and therfore it is no\nreson that ye kepe hym to youre vse.  And ye haue also the hour\nand the tyme I-writen that was in engendred.  And ye knowe\nalso that it was do be me, and so sholde myn be the synne; but\nI dede it helpe, for I trowe the moder ther-of sholde be sore\na-schamed yef she her-silf dide it norish; and a woman hath no\nwitte ageins that she may not hiden, and a-gein the worlde.  And\ntherfore I will that Vlfyn make a letter of recorde that I shall\nhym haue, and the houre and the nyght that he was in\nengendred.  And ye shull no more se me be-fore that day that he\nshalbe born, the nexte nyght after.  And I pray yow, as my lorde,\nthat ye truste well to Vlfyn, of that he shall sey vnto yow, for\nhe loveth yow full trewly, ne he shall not rede yow no-thynge\nbut for youre profite and grete wurship.  And I shall no more\nspeke with yow these vj monethes, but I shall speke to Vlfyn,\nand therfore do be hys counseile, yef thow wilt holde trouth,\nand haue my love fro hens-forth.\" In this maner kepte Vlfyn the recorde of the engenderinge of\nthe childe.  And Merlin toke the kynge in counseile, and\nseide, \"Sir, thow shalt haue Ygerne in mariage; but be wel\nware that she ne knowe not that thow leyn by her, and that is a\nthinge that moste shall make hir in thy mercy, ffor yef thow\naske hir be whom that she is grete, she can not telle the who is\nthe fader, and so shall she haue of the grete shame; and also\nthat is a thinge that may beste helpe me to haue the childe.\"\nAnd than Merlin toke leve of the kynge, and the kynge rode\nforth his iourneyes till he come to a Cardoel.  And Merlin wente to\nBlase, and tolde hym alle these thinges, and many other, and alle\nhe wrote in his boke.  And whan the kynge was come to Cardoel,\nhe sente after the men of hys counseile, and asked what was theire\nrede in this thinge.  And thei seide, \"We rede that ye make\npees with the duchesse, and with the frendes of the Duke; and\nthei may well lete hir knowe that she may not hir diffende agein\nyow, and that ye will do hem grete wurship to have pees with\nhem; and also comaunde to go to Tintagel, to speke with the\nduchesse, and with the Dukes frendes, and loke yef thei will\nhaue this pees; and yef youre counseilers a-corden, ye shull do\nas thei desire.\"  Thus wente the barons to Tintagel; and the\nkynge a-bode at Cardoel, and toke Vlfin in counseile, and asked\nasked hym what he redde in this mater.  And he seide his rede\nwas to haue pees.  And the kynge seide, \"Vlfin, thow haste\nthis pees ordeyned in thyn herte, and I wote well what.\"  And\nVlfin seide, \"Yef I haue it purposed, and ye it knowen, than\nwite ye whether it plese yow or no?\"  And the kynge seide,\n\"It plesith me wele, and wolde fain it were don as thow haste it\ndevised in thy herte.\"  And Vlfyn seide, \"Ne entermete not\nyow to profer, ne to sone to graunten, for I shall it wele bringe\nto gode ende.\"  And the kynge prayed ther-to hertely.  Thus\nhaue thei endid theire counseile.  And the kynges massagers\ncome to Tintagel, and fonde the duchesse and the frendes of the\nduke.  And ther thei shewde their massage, and how that the\nduke was deed thourgh hys owne outerage, and seide also how\nthe kynge was therfore right sory, and gladly wolde make a-mendement to the lady, and to alle his frendes.  And thei\nsaugh wele that thei myght not deffende hem agein the kynges\nwratth, and therfore thei counseiled the lady and the frendes of\nthe Duke to haue pees with the kynge.  And the lady seide, and\nhir frendes, thei wolde take counseile.  And so they wente\ntogeder; and the ladyes frendes counseiled the frendes of the duke\nto haue pees with the kynge, and that he was slayn also by his\nowne outrage.  \"And also, ye knowe wele, we may not vs\ndefende agein the kynge; but lete vs here thise worthi men what\npees that the kynge will make with vs.  And in soche maner it\nmay be that it ought not to be refused, for of two euelles it is\ngode to take the lesse; and this is oure counseile.\"  And the\nduchesse seide, \"I will not refuse the rede of yow that beth the\nfrendes of my gode lorde; ne I ne knowen not whom I sholde so\nwele love and truste.\"  And thus thei com oute from this\ncounseile.\" And than spake oon of the worthiest and moste wise that\nwas on the ladies side to the kynges messagers, and seide\nthese wordes, \"Sirs, my ladyes counseile and she wolde gladly\nwiten what a-mendes the kynge wolde do of hir lorde that is\ndeed?\"  And the messagers seyden a-noon, \"Lordinges, we\nknowe not the will of the kynge, but thus moche he hath seide,\nthat he will a-mende it be the a-vise and counseile of his\nbarons.\"  And than seide they, \"He shall it a-menden wele, yef god\nwill.\"  Than toke they day till the quynsyne that the lady and hir\nfrendes sholde come be-fore the kynge, for to haue right, and\nto here what the kynge wolde sey, and yef the kynges profer\nmyght not agre the lady, and also hir frendes, thei hadde saf\ncondite to returne to Tintagel.  Thus was take the day of\na-mendement.  And messagers com to the kynge, and seide as thei hadde\nfounden, and the counseile that the lady hadde.  And the kynge\nseide thei sholde haue conduyte with gode will, yef thei aske\nreson.  In this manere soiourned the kynge all that woke at\nCardoel, and spake be-twene hym and Vlfyn of many thinges.  And\nat the quynsyne, be counseile of his barons, he sente to the\nduchesse conduyte.  And whan she was come, the kynge made aske of the lady and hir counseile, what a-mendes she required\nfor the deth of hir lorde.  The ladyes counseile ansuerde and\nseide, \"Sir, my lady is not comen to aske a-mendes, but for to\nhere what shall be don to hir for the deth of hir lorde.\"  And\nthei that the kynge hadde made aske this demande, come to the\nkynge, and seide as thei hadden herde.  And than the kynge\nprased gretly theire wise ansuere; and than the kynge asked his\nbarons and his counseile, \"What is youre rede in this mater?\"\nAnd thei seide, \"That many no man knowe, saf youre-self, what\npees ye will make with hem, ne what ye will hem offre.\"  And\nthe kynge seide, \"I shall sone haue tolde yow the thought of\nmyn herte; ye be alle my men and of my counseile, and\ntherfore I put it all vpon yow, and kepe ye myn honoure as ye owe to\ndo.  And what ye ordeyne I shall it not denye.\"  And they\nseide, \"More may we not asken; but this is yet a grete thinge\nthat we dar it not vndirtake; but we be right sure that ye shull\nvs come no magre.\"  And Vlfin seide, \"It semeth that ye holde\nthe kynge a fole, whan ye leve no thinge that he seith vnto\nyow.\"  And thei seide, \"Yesse, we trow hym wele; but we\nbeseche the kynge that he comaunde yow to ben oon of vs, and to\nhelpe vs to counseile by yowre advyse in the beste wyse that ye\ncan.\" Whan the kynge herde hem desire Vlfyn to be of here\ncounseile, he made semblaunce as he hadde be gladde, and\nseide to Vlfyn, \"I have norshid the, and made the a riche man,\nand I knowe wele thow art wise; go forth and counseile hem\nthe beste that thow canste or mayste.\"  And he ansuerde, \"So\nshall I do, seth ye me comaunden; but this I will that ye knowe,\nthat ther is no kynge ne prince that may be to moche be-loved of\nhis peple, ne he may not to moche obbeye hym-self for to haue\ntheire hertes.\"  Thus wente Vlfin to counseile a-monge the barons\nand the worthy men.  And whan thei were come to-geder they\nasked the best rede in this cas.  And Vlfin seide, \"Ye haue wele\nherde how the kynge hath put hym vpon yow; now lete vs go to the lady and hir frendes, and wete yef they will holde the\nsame.\"  And thei ansuerde that he had wele seide and wisely.  And so\nthey yede to the lady and hir frendes, to knowe theire will.  And\nwhan thei were come be-fore hir, of her wordes this was the\nsomme.  Thei seiden how the kynge hadde a-greed hym-self all to\ntheire ordenaunce; \"and thei we come for to knowe, yef she and\nhir frendes wolde assente to the ende and a-mendes that they\nwolde ordeyne in the same wise as did the kynge.\"  And her\nfrendes seide of this thei wolde take counseile.  And she toke\nhir counseile to-geder what was beste to do ther-inne.  And thei\nseide the kynge myght no more profer than to put hym-self in the\nordenaunce of his barons.  To this thei acorded, bothe the kynge\nand the lady and her frendes, and the parentes of the Duke, and\nmaden gode suertee, bothe on that oon part and the tother.  And\nthan the barons wente to-geder, and asked oon of a-nother what\nwas beste rede in this mater.  And whan euery man hadde seide\nhis advise, thei asked Vlfin what was his rede in that cas.  And\nVlfyn seide, \"I shall sey myn avise, and that I say I will sey in\nall places.  Ye knowe well,\" quod Vlfyn, \"that the Duke was\ndeed by the kynge and by his force, and that he hadde not forfet\nfor to dye.  And, wite ye wele, the lady is lefte charged with\nchilde; and ye knowe well the kynge hath hir londe wasted\nand distroyed.  And ye knowe wele also that she is oon of the\nbeste ladies of the worlde, and oon of the wisest; and ye knowe\nalso that the parentes of the Duke haue grete losse by thys deth,\nand therfore it is right that the kynge restore hem agein her\nlondes, after that thei ben; and that he haue here hertes and hir\nlove.  And on the tother part, ye knowe that the kinge is\nwithoute wif; and I sey as be myn avise, the kynge ne may a-mende\nthis damage, but yef he take hir to his wif; and this me semeth\nhe ought wele to do for hir and for oure love, and for them of\nthe reeme that of this a-mendes shull heren.  And whan he hath\nall thus do, and graunded that, than he first of all mary the\nDukes eldest doughter to kynge loth of Orcanye, whiche is here presente, and to his other frendens, that he do so, that they holde\nhym here gode lorde and trewe kynge.\" \"Now haue ye herde,\" quod Vlfin, \"my counseile; now\nmay ye sey what ye semeth yef this be not to yow\na-greable.\"  And thei ansuerde alle with oon assent, and seide,\n\"Thow hast seide the beste counseile of the worlde, and the\nhiest that euer man durste thynke.  And yef ye dur sey so to\nthe kynge as ye haue seide here, and that we may se he therto\na-corde, and we shull yow helpe ther-to right gladly.\"  And Vlfin\nansuerde, \"Ye ne sey not i-nough, but yef ye will ther-to a-corde\nplaynly, I shall reherse the wordes to the kynges presence.  And\nlo, here the kynge of Orcanye, on whom I sey grete parti of the\npees, and therfore lete vs here hys avise.\"  And the kynge loth\nseide, \"For ought that ye haue seide touchinge me, I will not\nthat the pees be lefte.\"  And whan thise othir herde this, thei\na-corden to this counseile alle, and com to the kynges\nteinte.  And the lady was sente fore, and alle that weren of hir\ncounseile.  And whan thei were alle assembled, thei sat alle, saf\nVlfin; he was stondinge, and rehersed the a-corde of the pees as\nit was be-fore spoken.  And than he seide to the barons, \"Be ye\nnot alle thus a-corded?\"  And they seiden alle, \"Yesse.\"  Than\nhe turned to the kynge, and seide, \"Sir, how sey ye to this\nthinge; will ye ther-to agreen to the acorde and ordenaunce\nof these worthy lordes?\"  And the kynge seide, \"Ye, yef the\nduchesse and her frendes be contente, and that the kynge loth\nwill for me take the Dukes doughter.\"  And than ansuerde the\nkynge loth, \"Sir, ther is nothinge that ye me requyre for youre\nlove or youre profite but I will it gladly performe.\"  Than spake\nVlfyn to hym that hadde the wordes for the duchesse, a-lowde,\nthat alle it myght heren, and seide, \"Assente ye to this pees and\nacorde?\"  And ansuerde full wisely and pitously, be-holdinge\nhis lady and her counseile, of whom the tounges of hir hertes\nwere at hir yen, so that thei gonne wepe for ioye and pite; and\nhe also that ansuerde to Vlfyn dide wepe, and seide that so high\nand wurschipful a-mendes dide neuer a lorde to his man.  And\nthan the lady and hir counseile toke theire avisement, and thei seiden, \"Ther is no man in the worlde but he ought her-to\nassenten; wherfore we rede in-as-moche as we se that the kynge\nis so gracious a man and so trewe, that after alle these wordes\nwe submytte vs holy to his ordenaunce.\"  And thus was the\npees graunted on that oon side and the tother.  And so\nVterpendragon toke Ygerne to his wif, and maried her doughter to kynge\nloth of Orcanye.  The weddynge of the kynge and Ygerne was\nthe xxti day after that he hadde by hir leyn in hir\nchamber.  And of her doughter that was maried to kynge loth com Gawein,\nAgrauuayn, Gaheret, and gaheries, and mordred.  And the kynge\nuentres of Garlot hadde a-nother of hir doughters, that was geten\non baste, whos name was Morgeins.  And be the counseile of alle\nhir frendes the kynge sette hir to skole in an house of religion, and\nshe lerned so moche of an arte that is cleped astronomye, wher-in\nshe wrought many tymes; and by that crafte was she cleped\nmorgne-le-fee.  The other doughters alle the kynge dide marye,\nand moche he dide for the Dukes kyn and frendes. Thus was the kynge wedded to Ygerne, and kepe her till her\ngretnesse apered.  And as the kynge on a nyght lay with\nher, he asked with whom she was so grete, and \u00feat she myght\nnot be so grete with hym, seth the tyme thei were wedded, ffor\nhe hadde neuer tyme with her leyn but that the tyme was\nwreten; ne she ne myght be grete by the Duke, for longe tyme\nbe-fore his deth she hadde not hym seyn.  Thus the kynge oposed\nYgerne, and she hadde grete drede, and seide wepinge, \"Sir, of\nthis that ye sey I may make to yow no lesynge, ne of other\nthinges shall I not lyen; ffor oure lordes love, haue mercy on\nme, and I shall telle yow a merveile that is very soth, yef ye\nwill me assure, yef it plese yow, that ye shull not me\nforsaken.\"  Quod the kynge, \"Seith on hardely, for I will not departe fro\nyow in no wise for nothinge that ye sey.\"  And than was the\nquene glad, and seide, \"Sir, I shall telle yow a wonder\nthinge.\"  And she tolde hym how a man hadde leyn with hir in semblaunce\nof the Duke, and brought with hym two men in semblaunce of\ntwo that the Duke loved beste of all the worlde.  And thus com\nhe to my chambir, seinge alle my peple, and lay with me.  And I wende verily it hadde be my lorde; and he be-gate the childe\nthat I am now with so grete.  And I knowe wele it was that\nsame nyght that my lorde were slain, for he lay with me whan\ntydinges com of my lordes deth.  And than made he me to\nvndirstonde that he was my lorde, and that his peple ne wisten\nnot that he was come to me.  And so he departed, when he hadde\nherde these tidinges, and seide to me, 'Feire wif, loke than noon\nthis knowe, as moche as ye may kepe this secret, for so sholde ye\nbe shamed yef it were knowen,'\" \"And I will that ye it knowe\nthat this childe that shalbe born of yow, nys nother youre ne\nmyn by reson; wherfore I pray yow that whan it is born, ye\nyevith ther as I shall comaunde to be yoven, that neuer we here\nther-of speke.\"  And she ansuerde, \"Sir, of me and all that to\nme aperteneth, may ye do youre volunte.\"  Than com the kynge to Vlfyn, and tolde these wordes of hym and the quene. When Vlfyn vndirstode, he ansuerde the kynge, \"Now may\nye knowe that my lady is both gode and trewe, and also\nwise, that so grete a thinge durste yow counsell.  And ye haue\nalso wele spedde the entente of Merlin, that in other maner ne\nmyght haue the childe that she is with grete.\"  Thus they\nendured to the vj monethes ende, that Merlyn hadde sette to\nspeke with Vlfyn previly, and hym asked tydinges of that he\nwolde; and when thei hadde spoke to-gedir, he sente after the\nkynge be Vlfyn.  And whan they were alle thre assembled, the\nkynge tolde Merlin how he hadde do with the quene, and how he\nhadde made the pees for to haue the childe.  And Merlin seide,\n\"Vlfyn is som-what a-quytte of the synne that he hadde in the\nlove makinge, but I am not yet a-quyt of that; I helped to\ndisseyve the lady ne of the childe that she hath with-inne hir,\nof whom she wote not who is the fader.\"  And the kynge seide,\n\"Ye be so gode and so wise that ye can yow wele in this\na-quyten.\"  And Merlin seide, \"Ther-to moste ye helpe.\"  And\nthe kynge seide he wolde hym helpe in all the maner that he\ncan, and the childe wolde he make hym to haue.  And Merlin seide, \"Ther is in this contre a gode man, that is oon of the\ntrewest of all thi reame; and he hath a wif that is gode\nwoman and a wise, and the trewest of this londe and beste\ntacched of alle gode condiciouns; and she is now leide down in\nhir bedde of a childe male, and hir lorde is not moste riche man;\nther-fore I wolde that ye sende for hym, and yeve so of youre\ngoode, that he and the gode lady his wif swere on a boke to kepe\na childe that shalbe brought vnto them, and that she yeve it soke\nof hir owne mylke, and hir owne childe to be put to a-nothir\nwoman to be norisshed, and that they norisshe and kepe that\nchilde that shalbe brought vnto hem.\"  And the kynge seide,\n\"Euen as thow haste seide, so shall I do.\"  And Merlin toke his\nleve, and wente to Blase.  And Vterpendragon sente after this\nnoble knight; and whan he was come, the kynge made hym gret\nchere; and merveiled why the kynge made hym soche grete\nfeeste.  And the kynge seide, \"Dere frende, I most discure to\nyow a merveile that is me be-fallen, and ye be my lege man, and\ntherfore I pray yow for the feith that ye owen vnto me, that ye\nme helpe, after that I haue seide yow my counseile, and that ye\nkepe it secrete to youre power.\"  And he ansuerde, \"Syr, ther is\nnothinge that ye sey to me, or commaunde me to do, but that I\nshall do it with  all my power; and yef it be a thynge that I may\nnot do, I shall it wele counseile.\"  And the kynge seide, \"Ther\nis be-falle to me a wondir thynge in my slepe: of a man that\ncome be-fore me, and seide ye be the worthiest man of all my\nreame, and moste trewe to me; and also he seide that ye hadde\nengendered on youre wif a childe that is born; and he badde me\nthat I sholde pray yow to put youre owne childe to sowken\na-nother woman, for my love, and youre wif to yeve the childe\nsowken of her owne mylke that shall be brought vn-to hir, and\nit kepe and norisshen.\" Whan the gode man herde this ansuere, \"Sir, this is a\ngrete thynge that ye me requyre: that I sholde my\nchilde disseuer from his nature, and make hym to be norisshed of\na-nothir woman; and, sir, I pray yow, when shall this childe be\nborn, and to me be brought?\"  And the kynge seyde, \"So god me helpe, I wote neuer.\"  And than seide the knyght, \"Sir, ther is nothinge in this worlde that ye me comaunde but I shall\nit don.\"  Than the kynge yaf hym so grete yeftes that he was\nall astoned ther-of, and com home to his wif, and tolde her as\nthe kynge hadde seide.  And whan she it herde, she thought\nit a straunge thinge, and seide, \"Sir, how may I that do,\nfor to leve my sone for another mannes?\"  And the gode man\nseide,  \"Ther is nothinge but that we moste it do for hym\nthat it oure sourein lorde; and he hath yoven vs so moche,\nand promysed, that we moste nede don hys plesir and his\nvolunte, and I will verily that ye it graunten.\"  And she\nansuerde, \"I am yowre and the childe youre, therfore do with\nme and with hym youre will; and I it graunten wele, for I\nought in no wise to do agein your volunte.\"  Than he bad hir\nordeyne a-nother woman to norissh hir sone, for he dide but\na-waite after the hour that the tother sholde be brought; and\nthus disseuerid the gode man his sone fro his wif.  And the\nkynge sawgh that the quene was redy to ly down.  And the day\nbe-fore com Merlin to court secretly, and seide to Vlfyn, \"I am\nwele plesed with the kynge, for he hath wele do as I seide to\nhym.  Now go, bid hym go to the quene, and bid hym telle her\nthat shall haue chylde to-morow at nyght, after mydnyght, and\ncomaunde her that she do the childe to be delyuered to the firste\nman that shall mete at issue of the halle.\"  And whan Vlfyn\nherde that, he seide, \"Shull ye not speke with the kynge?\"\nAnd Merlin seide, \"No.\"  Than com Vlfyn to the kynge, and\nseide as Merlin hadde comaunded.  Whan the kynge herde that, he\nmade grete ioye, and seide, \"Shall I not speke with Merlyn er\nhe go?\"  And Vlfin seide, \"Nay; but do as he hath sente yow\nworde.\"  Than yede the kynge to the quene, and seide, \"I shall\ntelle yow a thynge that ye shall fynde trewe, and doth as I shall\ncomaunde yow.\"  And she seide, \"Sir, I will do as ye comaunde.\"\nAnd the kynge seide, \"To-morow, after mydnyght, with the\ngrace of god, ye shull be deliuered of the childe in youre wombe; And I pray yow and require that as soone as it is born\nthat ye take it to oon of youre moste secrete woman, and bid hir\ndeliuer it to the firste man \u00feat she fyndeth at the issue of the\nhalle; and that ye sey to hem that be at the birthe of the childe\nthat they speke neuer worde ther-of, ne discure that ye hadde\nchilde, for moche peple shull sey than that it were neuer myn,\nne me semeth not it sholde be.\"  And the lady ansuerde, \"Sir,\nthat I haue tolde yow is trewe;\" and seide, \"I knowe not who it\nbe-gat; and I shall do that ye comaunde as she that hath grete\nshame of hir mysauenture.  But of this haue I grete merveile:\nthat ye knowe so wele my delyueraunce; and I pray yow that ye\ndo as I yow say;\" and seide, \"So shall I do so god be myn\nhelpe.\"  Thus departed the counseile of the kynge and the quene.  And\nshe a-bode as longe as god wolde.  And the morowe after\nevesonge toke hir grete disese of trauelinge, vnto the hour that the\nkynge hadde hir seide, and a-noon after mydnyght she was\ndelyuerid.  And than a-noon she cleped a woman that she moste\ntrusted, and seide, \"Take this childe, and bere it to the halle\ndore, and yef ye fynde ther a man that it aske, deliuere it to\nhym, and take gode hede what man he be.\"  This woman dide\nas the quene comaunded; toke the childe, and folded it in the\nbeste clothes that she hadde, and bar it to the halle dore; and\nwhan she come ther, she fonde a man that semed right olde\nand rympled.  And she seyde, \"What a-bidest thow after?\"\nAnd he seide, \"For that that thow bringeste.\"  And she seide,\n\"What man art thow; to whom shall I telle my lady that I\nhaue yoven her childe?\"  Quod he, \"Ther-of hast thow nought\nto done, but do as thow art comaunded;\" and toke hym the\nchilde.  And a-noon as he it hadde, she wiste not where he was\nbe-comen, and com ayen to the lady, and seide she hadde yove\nthe childe to right an olde man; but I wote not what he is elles,\nfor as sone as I hadde it hym delyuered he was vanysshid in\nsoche maner that I knewe not where he be-cam.\"  The quene dide\nwepe, as she that hadde grete doel, and he that hadde this childe yede as faste as he myght to Antor, and fonde hym erly, as he\nwas goinge to masse.  And he hadde take the semblaunce of a\nmoche olde man, and called to hym, and seide, \"Antor!  I\nwolde speke with the.\" \"And I with yow,\" quod he gladly.\nThe olde man seide, \"I haue brought the a childe, and I pray\nthe that thow do it norisshe as richely as thow wolde do thyn\nowne.  And, wite thow wele, yef thow do thus, grete gode shall\ncome to the and thyn heyres; and yef a man tolde it the, thow\nwoldest it not be-leve.\"  And Antor ansuerde, \"This is the\nchilde that the kynge me praide to norisshe of my wif, and to\nput a-wey myn for hym.\"  And he seide, \"It is the same\nsaunzfaile; and the kynge and all worthi men and worthi wemen\noughten the to preyen, and I my-self the preye; and, wite it well,\nthat my prayer is as moche worth as a riche mannes.\"  Antor\ntoke the childe, and saught it was right faire, and asked yef it\nwere cristned, and he saide, \"Nay; but now a-noon do it baptise\nin this chirche.\"  And Antor toke it gladly, and asked of hym\n\"What shall be his name?\"  And he seide, \"My rede is that\nthow clepe it Arthur, and thow shalt fynde that it shall falle\nto the grete welthe, er thow haue it kept longe while.  And\nthow ne thy wif shall not wite whethir thow shalt love better of\nthi childe or hit.\" Antor seide, \"Who shall I sey hath take me this childe, and\nwhat man ye be?\"  And he seide, \"Ye shall not knowe at\nthis tyme no more of me.\"  And thus thei departed, and Antor\nmade the childe to be baptised, and cleped hym Arthur, and bar\nhym to his wif, and seide, \"Lo, here the childe that I haue yow\nso moche I-praide fore.\"  And she seide, \"It is welcome.\"  And\nshe toke it, and asked yef it were baptised.  And he seide, \"Ye,\nand his name is Arthur.\"  Than the lady yaf it sowke, and it\nnorisshed, and put her sone to a-nothir woman.  And\nVterpendragon hilde after the londe longe tyme; and so he fill in a grete\nsekenesse of the gowte in handes and feet.  And thanne a-ros the\nDanes in many places of the londe a-gein hym, and dide grete\noutrage; so that he sente for his barons, and asked theire\ncounseile.  And the barons redden to be avenged vpon hem, yef he myght.  Than seide Vterpendragon, \"I pray yow assemble yow\na power as worthi men owe for theire lorde.\"  And thei seide\nthei wolde so with gode will.  And so they yede, and met\nwith their enmyes, and saugh that thei hadde drawe to hem\ngrete part of the londe.  And the kynges men were with-outen\na lorde assembled, and were discounfited; and so loste the kynge\ngrete part of his men.  Whan the kynge herde tydinges that his\nmen were discounfited, he was full wroth.  Than come the\nremenaunte from the bataile. And whan the tother party hadde\ndiscounfited this bataile, thei encresed moche of peple, and wexed\nright stronge.  And Merlin, that alle these thinges knewe, com\nto Vterpendragon, that for his maladie was right feble.  And\nwhan he wiste that Merlyn was come, he was gladde, and\nthought in his herte that now he sholde haue counfort.  Whan\nMerlin come be-fore Vterpendragon, he made hym right feire\nchere.  And Merlin seide, \"Ye be right seke, and gretly ye be\nafraide.\"  And Vterpendragon seide, \"I haue right, for my men,\nand that ye knowe wele, and that I wende to haue no drede of,\nhaue distroyde my reame, and slayn my men in bataile.\"  And\nMerlin seide, \"Now maist thow se that peple ne a-vaile not in\nbataile with-oute a gode lorde.\"  And the kynge seide, \"For\ngodes love, Merlin, counseile me what I shall do.\"  And Merlin\nseide, \"I will telle the a thynge in previte, that I will tho\nbyleve: make somowne all thyn oste an thy peple; and whan\nthei be alle come, do the to be bore in a lytier, and so go fight\nwith thyn enmyes; and, wite it verily, thow shalt hem\nvenquise.  And whan thow hast hem venquysed, thow shalt knowe well\nwhat a londe is worth that is with-outen a kynge.  And whan\nthow hast thus don, departe for god, and for thy soule all thy\ntresour, for thow maiste not longe ther-after lyven.  And I will\nwele that thow knowe that thei that haue this grete auers, and\ndiden er it be departed, that the merite of the godes be not\ntheires; but it is theirs that will not suffre hem to do nought\nfor theire owne soules, and tho be develes.  And, wite wele, it\nwere better to the richeman that he hadde neuer nought I-hadde,\nbut he departe in his lif tyme.  The richesse and the honoures of the worlde doth but annoye to the soule; but yef it be spent\nand departed as it oweth to be, and thow that knowest thow\nmoste make an ende, thow oweste to departe hem in soche maner\nthat thow lese not the lif perdurable, ne the ioye of the tother\nworlde; for this is but vanyte, and that shall I shewe in oon worde; noon hath here so grete ioye erthly to whom it ne\nfaileth, and that oon beyeth in the othir worlde may neuer faile\nne a-peire; and what oon suffred in this worlde, oure lorde doth\nit to prove hym for the tother.  Therfore, yef thow be wise of\nthat god hath the yoven in this mortall lif, that thow ther-with\npurchase the lif euerlastynge.  And thow that haste had so grete\ngoodes in this worlde, what hast thow do for oure lorde that alle\nthese graces hath the yoven? I haue the moche loved, and I love\nthe, and knewe wele that noon may so wele love as thi-self; and\nas I haue the seide, thow maist not longe lyve after this\nvictorye.  And alle the gode dedis a man doth by his lyve is litill a-vaile\nbut yef he haue gode ende; and yef thow haddest do alle the\ngode dedes of the worlde, and thyn ende were euell, thow were\nin a venture all for to lese; and yef thow hadde don all the\nwikkednesse of the worlde, and thow haddest gode ende, thow\nsholdest haue pardon.  And I do the to wite thow shalt nought\nhaue with the oute of this worlde, but thy gode dedes.  Now do\nthat thow hast to do; and thow knowest wele that thy wif\nYgerne is deed, and that thow maist no mo haue; and thy londe be left after the with-outen heire; and therefore enforce\nthe to do well, for thyn owen soule.  Ffare-well now, for I haue\nno more with the to do; but bid Vlfyn to yeve credence to me\nwhan myster is, and than he helpe me to bere trewe witnesse\nwhan nede is, and recorde the trowthe.\"  And Vterpendragon\nseide, \"This is a ferly thinge that thow hast seide, I sholde\nvenquyse myn enmyes in a litere; how may I that yelde to oure\nlorde?\" And Merlin seide.  \"By thi gode ende.  And now I go;\nI pray the, after the bataile, haue mynde of that I haue the\nseide.\"  And Vterpendragon asked tidinges of the childe that he\nbar a-wey.  And Merlin seide, \"Of that ne recche the nothinge\nfor to enquere; but this I will that thow wite, that the childe is feire and well growen, and well taught and norisshed.\"  And\nthe kynge asked, \"Shall I se yow euer eny more after\nthis?\"  And Merlyn seyde, \"Ye, ones, and neuer no more.\" Thus departed the kynge and Merlin.  And the kynge\nsomowned his oste, and seide he wolde go with hem on\nhis enmyes.  Than he was ledde in a letere; and the sarazins com\nand fought with hym.  And the kynges men, be the counseile of\nher lorde, discounfited their enmyes, and slowen grete plente;\nthat hadde the kynge the victorye of the bataile, and venquysed\nhis enmyes.  And so the londe was set in pees; and than he\nbe-thought hym of that Merlin hadde hym seide, and repeired to\nlondon, and sente for his grete tresour, and yaf his godes to gode men\nand gode women, and to mysese peple of his reame, and dide\nmany faire almesse dedes; and the remenaunt he dide departe be\nthe advise of his mynistres to holy cherche.  Thus departed the\nkynge his tresoure, that nought be lefte to hym-self wher-of he\ncowde remembre, that he ne yaf all for the love of god by the\ncounseile of Merlyn. Full meke was the kynge a-gein god and the peple, and a-gein\nthe mynistres of holy cherche, that alle thei hadde grete\npite.  Thus was he kepte longe tyme seke; and his peple were\nassembled at london, that grete doute hadde of his deth.  And\nthei knewe wele that dye he moste, for he wax so feble that he\nmyght not speke in thre dayes.  Than com Merlin in to the town,\nthat all this wiste wele.  And whan he was come, the worthi\nmen maden hym to come be-fore them, and seiden, \"Merlyn,\nnow is the kynge deed that ye loved so wele.\"  And Merlin\nseide, \"Ye sey not wele; noon shall dye that maketh so gode\nende as he doth; ne he is not yet deed.\"  And thei seide, \"That\nhe is, for this thre dayes he spake no speche, ne neuer shall speke\nworde.\"  And Merlin seide, \"Yef god will he shall speke; now,\ncome, and ye shall heir hym speke.\"  And they seide that than\nhe dide grete merveile.  Than thei rede ther as the kynge lay,\nand opened alle the wyndowes; and than thei seide, \"Sir, lo\nhere Merlin.\"  And the kynge turned toward hym to his power,\nand made semblaunce that he knewe hym.  And Merlyn seide to the barons, prelates that ther weren, \"Now heir the laste worde\nthat the kynge shall speke.\"  And than thei drough nere, and\nseide, \"Trowest thow to make hym speke?\" And Merlin seide,\n\"Ye shull se.\" Than Merlyn turned hym on the tother side of the pailet,\nand rowned in the kynges ere, and seide, \"Thow haste\nmade a faire ende, yef thi conscyence be soche as the semblaunce;\nand I telle the thi sone Arthur shall be kynge nexte of thy reame\nafter the, be the vertu of Ihesu criste, and shall a-complisshe the\nrounde table that thow haste be-gonne.\"  Whan the kynge herde\nthat, he drough towarde hym, and seide, \"For godes love, pray\nhym to pray oure lorde Ihesu criste for me.\"  And Merlin seide\nto hem that ther were, \"Now haue ye herde the last worde that\nthe kynge hath spoke to me; and ye wende that he shulde neuer\nhaue spoken,\" And than wente Merlin, and alle the other that\nhadden grete merveile of Merlin that he hadde made hym to\nspeken, ne ther was noon that wiste what the kynge hadde seide,\nsaf Merlin.  Thus ended the kynge, and the princes, and the\nbarons, and bisshopes and archebisshopes dide hym the grettest\nhonoure and the feirest servise that thei myght.  Thus lefte the\nlonde with-outen heyre.  The morowe after the kynge was\nbiried assembled the barons and the prelates of the cherche, and\ntoke counseile how the reame sholde be gouerned, and neuer\nmyght the counseile a-corde to noon.  Than seide thei, be comen\nassent, thei wolde counseile with Merlyn, that hadde grete\nwisedom, and seide thei herde hym neuer but geve trewe counseile,\nand gode to euery man.  Thus thei acorded, and sente to seche\nafter Merlyn.", "5": "CHAPTER VI. ARTHUR MADE KING. Whan he was come be-fore hem, they seide, \"Merlyn, we\nknowe well thow art wise, and haste alwey loved wele\nthe kynges of this reame, and thow knowest wele that this londe\nis lefte with-outen heir; and a londe with-oute a lorde a-vaileth litill.  Therfore we pray the and requere to helpe vs to these\nsoche a man as myght the reame gouerne, to the profite of the\npeple and sauacion of holy cherche.\"  And Merlin seide, \"I am\nno soche man that owe to entermete of soche counseile, ne that I\nsholde chese a man to be a gouernoure; but yef ye acorde to myn\na-warde, I shall telle yow, and yef I sey not wele, a-corded not\nther-to.\"  And thei seide, \"Alle to the welfare and profite of vs\nalle oure lorde sende grace!\"  And Merlin seide, \"I haue mochc\nloved this reame and the peple ther-inne, and yef I wolde telle\nyow whom ye sholde make youre kynge, I ought wele to be\nbeleved, and it were right; but oon faire a-uenture is yow\nbefallen, yef ye will it knowen.  The kynge is now deed sithe\nMartin-masse, and fro hens to yoole is but litill space; and yef ye\nleve my counseile, I shall yeve yow gode and trewe, bothe ageyn\ngod and the worlde.\"  And thei seiden all at ones, \"Sey what\nthow wilte, and we shall it holden.\"  And he seide, \"Ye knowe\nwele that now cometh the feste that oure lorde was Inne I-bore,\nand he is lorde of alle lordes; and I will vndirtake, yef ye and\nalle the peple comynyally pray to oure lorde for his grete pite,\nfor to sende yow a rightfull gouernour, as he, through his grete\nhumylite at this feste, cleped yoole, liste to be born of a virgyn,\nand kynge of alle kynges; that he at this feste chese yow soche\na man to be youre kynge and lorde, that the peple may rule and\ngouerne to his plesir; and that he shew soche demonstraunce that\nthe peple may se and knowe that it is be his eleccion, and that he\nthat so is chosen be kynge with-oute eny other eleccion; and,\nwite ye well, yef ye thus do, ye shull se the eleccion of our lorde\nIhesu criste.\"  Than they ansuerde alle with oon assent, and\nseide, \"We acorde with this counseile, and ther is noon erthly\nman but that he ought ther-to acorde.\"  Than thei praide alle,\nbisshopis and archebisshopes, to comaunde thourgh alle the cherche,\nthat the peple to praye as ye haue herde.  And all the lordes\nwere sworne oon to a-nother to holde the awarde of holy cherche,\nin that god wolde hem shewen.  In this maner be thei acorded\nto the counseile of Merlin.  And Merlyn toke leve of hem, and\nthei hym praide to be with hem at Cristemasse, to se yef it were soth or no that he hadde hem taught.  And Merlyn seide,\n\"I shall not be ther, for ye shull not se me till the eleccion be\nmade.\"  Thus wente Merlin to blase, and tolde hym alle these\nthinges.  Than alle the worthy men of the reame of logres, thei\ncome vnto logres at the yole.  Thus was this thinge don and\na-biden to the yole.  And Antor, that hadde this childe norisshed\ntill he was a moche man of xv yere of age, he hadde hym trewly\nnorisshed, so that he was faire and moche, and he hadde neuer\nsoken other mylke but of his wif, and his sone he hadde made\nto be norysshed of a-nother woman, ne Antor wiste not whether\nhe loved better, ne he cleped hym never but his sone, and he\nwende verily that he hadde ben his fader.  At halowmasse Antor\nmade hys sone knyght, and at yoole he come to logres, as did\nthe other knyghtes of the londe, and brought with hym his\ntwo sones. On yoole even was assembled alle the clergie of the reame,\nand alle the barouns that weren of valoure and wele hadde\ndon as Merlin hadde seide; and whan they were alle come, thei\nledde alle symple lif and honeste.  Thus thei abode alle the\nyoole even, and weren at messe at mydnyght, and made mekely\ntheine orisouns to oure lorde, that he of his grace sende hem soche\na man that myght profitably meyntene hem and the cristen feith.\nThus they a-bode the messe of the day, and so ther were many\nthat seide thei were foles that trowed oure lorde wolde put his\nentente to chesinge of her kynge.  And as thei were in this\ntalkynge, thei rounge to messe of the day, and so thei yede to servise .  Whan thei were alle assembled, ther was oon of the\nholiest men of the londe araied to singe the messe, but er he\nyede to messe, he spake to the peple and seide, \"Ye be\nassembled for thre thinges for youre profite, and I shall say\nyow whiche thei be:  Ffirst of all, for the sauacion of youre\nsoules and for the wurship of god, and the myracle and high\nvertu that he thys day shall shewe a-monges vs yef it be his\nplesire to yeve vs a kynge and chiefteyn that may saue and\nmayntene holy cherche, that is the sustenaunce of alle trewe\ncristen peple, we be come to chese oon of vs, we be not so wise to knowe who is moste profitable of alle this peple; and for that\nwe ne knowe, we owe to praye to the kynge of kynges, that is\nIhesu criste oure saucoure, that he shewe vs verry tokenynge to\nhis pleasaunce as he was bore on this day, so euery man praye in\nthe beste wise he can.\"  And thus they did as the gode men\nhem counseiled; and he yede forth to messe and he com to the\ngospell, and that thei hadden offred.  Some of the peple yede\noute of the cherche where ther was a voyde place; and whan\nthey com oute of the cherche thei sawgh it gan dawe and clere,\nand saugh be-fore the cherche dore a grete ston foure square,\nand ne knewe of what ston it was; but some seide it was\nmarble.  And a-bove, in the myddill place of this ston, ther stode a styth\nof Iren that was largely half a fote of height, and thourgh this\nstithi was a swerde ficchid in to the ston. When thei sye this that firste weren come oute of the\nchirche, thei hadde gret merveile, and yede a-gein into\nthe chirche, and tolde the archebisshop.  And whan the gode\nman that sange masse herde this, he toke haly water, and caste\nvpon the stith.  And the archebisshop lowted to the swerde, and\nsawgh letteres of golde in the stiel; and he redde the letteres,\nthat seiden, \"Who taketh this swerde out of this ston sholde be\nkynge by the eleccion of Ihesu criste.\"  And when he hadde\nredde this letteres, he seide to the peple what it ment.  Than\nwas the ston deliuered to x worthi men to kepe, and to two\nclerkes.  Than thei seiden that oure lorde hadde hem shewed\nfeire myracle; and yeden a-gein in to the mynistre to heir oute\nthe masse, and to yelde oure lorde graces.  And thei soungen 'te\ndeum laudamus.'  And whan the gode man was come to the\nawter, he turned to the peple, and seide, \"Feire lordes, now may\nye se that some of yow be goode men, when thourgh youre prayers\nand orisouns oure lorde hath shewde this grete myracle; wherfore\nI praye and reqire yow a-boue alle vertues in this erthe, for\nhighnesse ne erthly richesse that god hath yoven in this worlde,\nthat noon be a-gein this eleccion that god hath vs shewde the\ndemonstraunce, and the surpluys he shall vs shewen at his\nvolunte.\" Thanne the godeman sange forth the masse; and whan it\nwas fynisshed, they assembled a-boute the ston, bothe\noon and other who that myght take oute this swerde firste.  And\nthan thei seiden and a-corded alle that thei sholde assaien it, as\nthe mynistres of holy cherche wolde assigne.  To this ther was\ngrete discorde amonge the higheste men and moste puyssaunt;\nand thei that hadde force seide they wolden asseyen firste; so\nther were many wordes that ought not to be rehersed.  The\narchebisshop spake that alle myght here, and seide, \"Sirs, ye ne\nbe not so wise, ne so wele a-vised men as I wende.  And I will\nwele \u00feat ye alle wite that oure lorde hath oon i-chosen, but I\nknowe not whom.  And thus moche may I say to yow, that\ngentilnesse ne richesse shall haue no power a-gein the wille of\nIhesu criste, but truste so moche in hym, that yef he that is\nther-to chosen were yet vn-bore, it shall neuer be taken oute of\nthe ston till he come that it is ordeyned the honour.\"  Than\na-corded alle the noble men and wise, and seide that he hadde\nseide soth.  And the wise men and the high barouns toke their\ncounseile, and a-corded to stonde the ordenaunce of the\narchebisshop, and com a-gein, and seiden heringe alle the peple.  And\nthan made the bisshop grete ioye, and dide wepe for pite, and\nseide, \"This humylite that is in youre hertes is of god; and I\nwill that ye knowe after myn entente, shall be to the volunte of\ngod and profite of cristen feith, so that I shall haue no blame yef\ngod will.\"  This parlament was be-fore high messe of the assay\nof the swerde, till that high messe was saide.  Than seide the\nArchebisshop to the peple, and shewed hem the gret myracle\nthat god hadde don for hem at this eleccion, \"and whan oure\nlorde sette Iustice in erthe, he sette it in the styth and in the\nswerde; and the Iustice ouer the lay peple ought to be the\nswerde, ffor the swerde at the be-gynynge was take to thre orderes\nto diffende holy cherche, and mayntene right witnesse.  And\noure lorde hath now made eleccion be the swerde; and, wite it\nwele, alle that this haue seen and be-holde to whom he will the\nIustice yeve.  And lete no man be to hasty for to assaye, for it\nshall neuer be drawen oute for richesse, ne for pride; ne the poure peple be not displesed, though the lordes and the high\nastates assaye be-fore, ffor it is right and reson that the lordes\nassaien firste; for ther ne is noon of yow but he ought to haue\nhis kynge and his lorde, the beste and moste worthy man that he\nkowthe knowe be his reson.\" Thus thei acorded to the archebisshop with gode herte, and\nwith-outen euyll will, that he sholde chese hem that he\nwolde to assaye firste.  Thus thei graunted alle to holde hym for\nhir kynge, to whom god wolde shewe his grace.  Thanne the\narche-bisshop chese oute C.l. of the hiest and moste worthi lordes,\nand made hem go to the assaie.  And whan they hadde alle\nassayed, than he commaunded alle other to assaye.  And than they\nassayden alle they, oon after a-nother, that assaye wolde; but\nther was noon that myght it taken oute.  And so it was\ncomaunded to be kept with x noble men; and thei were charge to\ntake goode hede who com to assaien, and yef eny ther were that\nmyght drawen out of the ston.  Thus was the swerde assaied\nalle \u00fee viij dayes, and alle the barouns were at high messe; and\nthe archebisshop hem preched, and shewde as hym semed\nbeste.  And than he seide, \"I tolde yow wele that all be leysere myght\nhe come that was ferthest fro the assaye of this swerde; now\nmay ye verily knowe that neuer noon, saf he that oure lorde\nwill, ne shall it not oute take.\"  And than thei seiden alle that\nthei wolde not out of the town, till thei westen to whom god\nwolde graunte that honoure.  In that maner thei a-biden oute the\nmesse, and after thei wente to their hosteles to mete, and after\nmete, as they were vsed that tyme, yede the barouns and the\nknyghtes to boorde in a feire pleyn, and the x men that were\nordeyned to kepe this swerde, yede also to se this bourdise.  And\nwhen the knyghtes hadde turneyd a-while, thei toke their\nsheldes to their squeres, so that the peple of the town yede to\narme them.  And Antor hadde made his eldeste sone knyght at\nthe halowtide be-fore yoole.  And whan the medle was be-gonne,\nKay called his brother Arthur, and seide, \"Go faste to oure oste,\nand fecche my swerde.\"  And Arthur was goode and seruisable,\nand seide, \"With gode will;\" and than smote the hors with the spores, and rode forth to his ostell for to fecche his brothers\nswerde, or ellis some other, yef he myght eny fynde.  And he\nfonde noon, ffor the hostesse hadde sette it in hir chambir.  And\nso he turned to hem a-gein; and whan he saugh he myght noon\nfynde, he gan to wepe for grete anger.  And as he come be-fore\nthe mynster ther the ston was, he saugh the swerde whiche he\nhadde neuer assaide, and thought yef he myght it gete to bere it\nto his brother.  And as he com ther-by on horse bakke, he hente\nthe swerde be the hiltes and drough it oute, and couered it with\nhis lappe.  And his brother that a-bode after with-oute the towne\nsaugh hym come, and rode a-gein hym, and asked his\nswerde.  And Arthur seide he myght not haue it; \"but I haue brought\nheere a-nother,\" and drough it oute from vndyr his cote, and\ntoke it to his brother.  And a-noon, as Kay saugh this swerde, he\nknewe it wele that it was the swerde of the ston, and thought\nhe wolde be kynge, and seide he wolde seche his fader till he\nfonde hym, and than he seide, \"Sire, I shall be kynge; lo, here\nis the swerde of the ston.\" Whan the fader it saugh, he hadde merveile how he it\ngatt.  And he seide he toke it oute of the ston.  Whan\nAntor herde that, he leved it not, but seide he dide lye.  Than\nthei yede to the mynster, ther the ston was, and the tother\nsquyre after.  Whan Antor sigh the ston, and the swerde not\nther-ynne, he seide, \"Feire sone, how hadde ye this swerde?\nLoke ye, do not lye; and thow do lye, I shall it know wele, and\nneuer shall I the love.\"  And he ansuerde as he that was sore\na-shamed, \"I shall yow lye no lesynge, for my brother Arthur it\nme brought whan I badde hym to go fecche myn, but I wote\nneuer how he it hadde.\"  Whan Antor herde this, he seide,\n\"Sone, yeve it me, for ye haue ther-to no ryght.\"  And Kay it\ndeliuered to his fader; and he loked be-hynde hym, and saugh\nArthur, and cleped hym, and seide, \"Come hider, faire sone,\nand take this swerde, and put it ther as ye it toke.\"  And he\ntoke the swerde, and put it in the stith, and it heilde as wele, or\nbetter, than it dide be-fore.  And Antor comaunded his sone Kay\nto take it oute; and he assaied, but it wolde not be.  Than Antor cleped hem bothe, and seide to Kay, \"I wiste well that\nthow haddest not take the swerde oute.\"  Thanne he toke\nArthur in his armes, and seide, \"Feire dere sone, yef I myght\npurchase that ye be kynge, what gode sholde I haue therfore?\"\n\"Ffader,\" quod he, \"I may nother haue that honour, ne noon\nother goode, but that ye be ther-of lorde, as my lorde and my\nfader.\"  And he seide, \"Sir, youre fader I am as in norture, but\ncertes I dide yow neuer engender, ne I wot neuer who dide yow\nengender.\"  Whan Arthur saugh that Antor hym denyed to ben\nhys fader, he wepte tendirly, and hadde grete doel, and seide,\n\"Feire sir, how sholde I haue this dignite, or eny other, whan I\nhaue failed to haue a fader.\"  \"A fader muste ye nede haue;\nbut, feire dere sir, yef oure lorde will that ye haue this grace,\nand I helpe yow it to purchase, telle me what I shall be the\nbetter?\"  And Arthur seide, \"Sir, so as ye will youre-self.\"\nThanne Antor tolde hym what bounte he hadde hym don, and how\nhe hadde hym norisshed, and how he put a-wey his sone Kay,\nand made hym to be norisshed of a straunge woman; \"where-fore\nye owe to yeve my sone and me guerdon, ffor ther was neuer\nman more tenderly norisshed than I haue yow.  Wherefore I\npraye yow, yef god yeve yow this grace, and I may helpe yow\nther-to, that ye guerdon me and my sone.\"  And Arthur seide,\n\"I praye yow that ye denye not me to be my fader, for than I\nsholde not wite whe\u00feer that I sholde go; and yef ye may helpe to\npurchase this grace, and god will that I haue it, ye can no-thinge\nsey ne comaunde but I shall it do.\"  And Antor seide, \"I shall\nnot aske thi londe; but thus moche I will praye yow, that yef ye\nbe kynge, that ye make my sone Kay youre stywarde in soche\nmaner that for no forfet that he do to yow, ne to man of youre\nlonde, that he lese not hys office; and yef he be fool, or fell, or\nvilenis, ye owe better to suffre hym than eny other; and\ntherfore I praye yow to graunte hym that I yow demaunde.\"  And\nArthur seide he wolde it do with gode will.  And than he ledde\nhym to the auter, and swore that he sholde this trewly\nperforme.  And whan he hadde sworne, he com be-fore the mynster; and\nthe turment was ended, and the barouns com to hire evesonge. Than Antor cleped alle his frendes, and com to the\nArchebisshop, and seide, \"Sir, lo, here is a childe of myn that\nis no knyght, that prayeth me that I wolde helpe that he myght\nassay the auenture of the swerde, and that it plese yow to clepe\nthe barouns.\"  And so he did; and thei assembled a-boute the\nston.  Than Antor bad Arthur take oute the swerde, and delyuere\nit to the Archebisshop.  And Arthur toke the swerde be the\nhiltes, and with-oute more taryinge yaf it to the\nArchebisshop.  And a-noon he toke Arthur in his armes, and seide \"Te deum\nlaudamus,\" and so brought hym in to the mynster.  And the\nbarouns and high men, that this hadde seyn and herde, were angry\nand sorowfull for this, and seiden it myght not be that soche a\nsymple man of so lowe degre sholde be lorde of hem\nalle.  Therwith was the Archebisshop displesed, and seide, \"Sirs, oure lorde\nknoweth beste what euery man is.\"  And Antor and his frendes\nabode by Arthur, and alle the comen peple; and alle the barouns\nwere a-geyn them and a-geyn Arthur.  And thanne seide the\narchebisshop wordes of grete hardynesse, \"I do yow to wite\nthaugh alle thei that ben in the worlde wolde be a-gein this\neleccion, and oure lorde will that this man be kynge, he shall be\nit with-outen faile; and I shall shewe yow how, and what\naffiaunce I haue in oure lorde Ihesu criste.  Now, feire brother\nArthur, go, put the swerde a-geyn in the same place that ye toke\nit fro.\"  And Arthur put the swerde a-geyn in the selue place,\nand it hilde as faste as by-fore.  And than seide the\nArchebisshop, \"So feire eleccion was neuer sene; now go ye, riche\nbarouns and lordes, and assay yef ye may take oute the swerde.\"\nThan yede alle for to assaye, but noon it myght remeve fro the\nplace that it was Inne.  Than seide the archebisshop, \"Grete\nfolye do ye that be a-geyn oure lordes wille; for now ye se well\nhow it is.\"  And thei seide, \"Sir, we ne be not a-gein oure lordes wille; but it ys grevouse thinge to vs to haue a garcion\nto be lorde ouer vs alle.\"  And the archebisshop seide, \"He that\nhath hym chosyn knoweth beste what he is.\"  Thanne the\nbarouns praide the bisshop to lete the swerde be stille in the ston\ntill Candelmesse; and by that tyme men of ferther contrees myght come to assaye the auenture.  And the archebisshop hem\ngraunted.  Than come oute of euery contree, and asseyde who\nthat wolde.  And whan they hadden assaied, the archebisshop\nseide, \"Arthur, yef it be pleser to oure lorde Ihesu criste that\nthow be kynge, go forth and brynge that swerde.\"  And Arthur\nyede to the swerde, and toke it oute as lyghtly as nothinge hadde\nit holden.  Whan the prelates and the comen peple saugh this, thei\nganne to wepe for ioye and pite, and seiden, \"Sirs, is ther yet\neny man that seith a-gein this eleccion?\"  And the barouns seide,\n\"Syr, we pray yow that the swerde be suffred yet in the ston to\nPassh, but eny man come by that terme that may take it thens;\nand ellis we will obbey to this; and yef ye will not suffre so\nlonge tyme, euery man do the beste he may.\"  And the\narchebisshop seide, \"Yef so be he a-bide to Passh, and noon other come\nthat may parforme this a-uenture, wele ye Than obbey yow to\nthis eleccion?\"  And thei seide alle, \"Ye.\"  Thanne the\narchebisshop seide to Arthur, \"Sette the swerde a-gein in the ston, for\nyef god will, thow shalt not faile of the dignite that he hath the\npromysed.\"  And Arthur did as he comaunded; and ther was\nordeyned to kepe the ston x men and v clerkes; and in this\nmaner thei bode to Pasch.  And tharchebisshop that hadde take\nArthur in warde, seide, \"Wite ye right well ye shall be kynge\nand lorde of this peple; now loke that ye be a gode man, and\nfro hens-forth cheseth soche men as shull be of youre counseile,\nand officers for youre housolde, euen as ye were now kynge, for\nso ye shall be with the helpe of god.\"  And Arthur seide, \"I put\nme holly in god and in holy cherche, and in youre gode counseile;\ntherefore chese ye as ye seme be moste to the plesaunce of Ihesu\ncriste; and I praye yow clepe to yow my lorde my fader.\"  Than\nthe archebisshop cleped Antor, and shewde hym the ansuere of\nArthur.  Thanne chose they soche counsellers as thei wolde; and\nbe counseile of the archebisshop and certein of the barouns, Kay\nwas made stiwarde.  And of alle other thinges thei a-bode to\nPasch, and than thei assembled alle at logres. Whan thei were alle assembled on the Ester even, the\narchebisshop drough hem alle to his paleis, and rehersed\nhem the grete wisdom and the gode condiciouns that he fonde in\nArthur.  And the barouns seide, \"We will not be a-gein godes\nordenaunce; but it is vnto vs a mervelouse thynge that so yonge\na man, and of so base lyngnage, sholde be lorde and gouernour of\nvs alle.\"  The archebisshop seide, \"Ye do not, as cristen men,\nthus to be a-gein cristes eleccion.\"  And they seide, \"We be\nnot ther agein; but ye haue seyn his condiciouns and we ne haue\nnot don so, and therfore we praye yow to suffre vs to knowe his\ncondiciouns, and the manere of hys gouernaunce that he will ben\nof here-after.\"  The archebisshop seide, \"Will ye thus delaye\nhis coronacion?\"  And thei seide, \"We wolde that his sacringe\nand coronacion be respite to Penticoste. Thus we alle pray and\nrequere.\"  And the archebisshop it graunted.  Thus departed\nalle the counseile; and on the morowe, whan hight messe was\nseide, Arthur yede to the swerde and toke it oute as lightly as\nhe hadde don be-fore.  Than thei seiden alle that thei wolde\nhaue hym to their lorde and gouernoure, and thei praide hym to\nsette ther the swerde a-gein.  And Arthur ansuerde to the barouns\nfull debonerly, and seide he wolde do their requeste, or eny\nthinge that thei wolde of hym desire.  Thanne they ledde hym\nin to the mynster to speke with hym, and to assaye his\ncondiciouns, and seide, \"Sir, we se well that god will that ye be oure\nkynge and lorde ouer vs, wherefore we will do to yow oure\nhomage and of yow holde oure honoures, and we be-seke yow to\nrespite youre sacringe in to Pentecoste, ne therefore shull ye\nnothynge be inteript, but that ye shull be oure lorde and oure\nkynge; but to this we praye yow to sey vs what is youre\nvolunte.\"  Quod Arthur, \"Of that ye sey ye will do to me\nyoure homages, and holde youre honoures of me, I may it not\nreceyve, ne I ne ought not to do, ffor I may not to yow ne to\nnoon other yeve noon honoures till I haue receyued myn; and\nther ye sey ye will that I be lorde of yow and of the reame, that\nmay not be by-fore that I be sacred and receyved the honoure of\nthe empere; but the respite that ye desire I it graunte yow with gode will, for I will not be sacred, ne nothinge that ther-to\naperteneth, ne I may not with-outen godes will and youre\nvolunte.\"  Thanne seide the barouns a-monge hem-self, \"Yef this\nchilde live he shall be right wise, and wele he hath vs\nansuerde.\"  And than thei seide, \"Sir, vs semeth with youre advice\nthat ye be crowned and sacred at Pentecoste, and by that terme\nwe shull obbey to yow at the comaundement of this\narchebisshop.\"  Thanne thei made be brought Iuellis and alle othir\nrichesse, and yaf it to hym to se whedir he wolde be couetouse\nand cacchynge; and whan he hadde alle these yeftes resceyved,\nthe booke seith he departed it; to knyghtes the stedes, and coursers,\nand fresshe robes; and to hem that were Ioly and ennoisies,\nhe yaf the Iuwellis; and to hem that were auerouse, golde and\nsiluer; and to sadde wise men he yaf soche thinge as hym dought\nsholde hem plese; and with hem he heilde companye, and\nenquered in the contre what myght hem beste plese. Thus departed he the yeftes that were yoven hym, for to\nknowe of what condicion that he wolde be of.  And whan\nthei sawgh hym thus demened, ther was noon but that hym\ngretly preysed in theire hertes, and seide that he sholde be of\nhigh renon, and that thei cowde not in hym espie no poynte of\ncovetise; but as sone as he hadde the grete auers, he be-sette hem\nin soche manere, that euery man seide that noon cowde haue do\nbetter, euerych astate and degre.  Thus thei assaide Arthur, and\nnought cowde fynde in hym but high vertu and grete\ndiscrecion.  And so thei a-biden to the Witsontide.  And than alle the\nbaronage assembled at logres, and ther thei assaide a-gein at the\nswerde alle that assaie wolde, but neuer was ther founde man that\nit myght remeve fro the ston.  And the archebisshop hadde\nordeyned redy the crowne and septre, and all that longed to the\nsacringe.  On witson even, be comen counseile of alle the barouns,\nthe archebisshop made Arthur knyght. Alle that nyght dide\nhe wake in the chief mynster, till on the morowe day.  And\nwhan it was day, alle the baronye come to the mynster.  The\narchebisshop seide, \"Sirs, lo here is the man that god hath\nchosen to be youre kynge, like as ye haue seyn and knowe. And, lo, here is the crowne and the vestementz rioall, ordeyned by\nyoure avys and alle the comen assent.  And yet ther be eny of\nyow that to this eleccion will not assent, lete hym now sey.\"  And\nthey ansuerde and seide, \"We acorde that in godes name he be\nsacred, and a-noynted with this, that yef ther be eny of vs that\nhe be with displesed of that we haue be a-geyn his coronacion,\nthat he pardon vs alle in to this day.\"  And ther-with thei\nkneled alle at ones to Arthur, askynge hym mercy.  And Arthur,\nfor pite, gan wepe, and seide to hem , \"That lorde whiche hath\ngraunted me to haue this honoure, mote yow pardon, and as moche\nas in me, I make yow quyte.\"  And ther-with thei risen vp,\nand toke hym by-twene their armes, and ledde hym to the\nvestymentz rioall.  And whan he was aried, the archebisshop was\nmade redy to synge masse, and seide to Arthur, \"Now go fecche\nthe swerde, wher-with ye shull kepe Iustice to deffende holy\ncherche, and mayntene right and the cristin feith to youre\npower.\"  And so they yede in procession to the ston.  Thanne\nseide the archebisshop to Arthur, \"Yef thow wilt swere to god,\nand to oure lady seint Marye, and to oure modir holy cherche,\nand to seint Petir, and to alle seyntes, to saue and to holde\ntrouth and pees in the londe, and to thy power kepe trewe\nIustice, com forth and take this swerde, whereby god hath made\nthe eleccion vpon the.\"  Whan Arthur herde this, of pite he\ngan wepe, and so dide many other.  And he seide, \"As verily\nas god is lorde ouer alle thynge, so he of his grete mercy graunte\nme grace and power this to mayn-tene like as ye haue rehersed,\nand I haue it well vndirstonde.\"  And than he sette hym on his\nknees, holdinge vp his hondes, and than toke oute the suerde\nlightly with-oute greuaunce, and so bar it vp right.  And thei\nledde hym to the auter, and ther he leide the swerde.  And than\nthei hym sacred and a-noynted, and dide that longed to a\nkynge.  And after all the seruise was ended, thei yede oute of the\nmynstir, and come by the place ther as was the ston; and no\nman cowde knowe where it was be-come.  Thus was Arthur\nchosen to kynge, and heilde the reame of logres longe in pees.", "6": "CHAPTER VII. REVOLT OF THE BARONS; AND DEFEAT OF THE SEVEN KINGS BY ARTHUR. A noon after the myddill of August, after that Arthur was\ncrowned, he helde court roiall, grete and mervelouse; and\ntheder come kynge loth of Orcanye, that helde the londe of\nloonois and a parte of Orkanye, and with hym v C knyghtes; and\nthider come the kynge vrien of gorre, that was a yonge knyght,\nand moche preised in armes, and with hym iiij C knyghtes; and\ntheder also come kynge Ventres of Garlot, that hadde wedded oon\nof Arthurs susters, and with hym com vij C knyghtes; and after\ncom Carados brenbras, that was kynge of the londe of Strangore,\nand was oon of the knyghtes of the rounde table, and with hym\nvj C knyghtes welle horsed; after that come kynge Aguysas of\nScotlonde, that was a freisshe yonge knyght, and with hym v C\nknyghtes; after hym come kynge Ydiers, with iiij C\nknyghtes.  Whan thei were alle assembled, Arthur dide hem grete honoure,\nand to hem made grete ioye and grete feste; and for thei were\nso high astates and men of grete puyssaunce, he made hem riche\npresentes, and yaf hem grete yeftes and riche, as he that therof\nhadde hym wele perveied.  Whanne these barons saugh the grete\nyeftes and the riche presentz that the kynge hadde hem yoven,\nthei heilde therof grete disdeyn, and seide a-monge hem-self, That\ngrete foles were they, whan of soche oon as he was of so base\nlynage, sholde be kynge of so worthi a reame as is the reame of\nlogres, and seide that thei wolde it no lenger suffre.  And thanne\nthei refused the yeftes that the kynge hadde hem offred, and\nyoven, and dide hem wele to wite that thei heilde hym not for\nther kynge ne lorde, but that he sholde in all haste voide oute of\nthe londe and the contree, so that he were no more seyn ther-in;\nand yef he wolde not voide the londe, and thei myght hym take,\nthey lete hym well to wite that ther was no more but he sholde\nbe deed.  Whan the kynge Arthur vndirstode their manaces, he\nyede oute by a wyndowe of karlion, for he douted moche of treson.  And thus thei soiourned xv dayes in the town, that they\ndide noon other forfet on nother side.  And than Merlyn entred\nin to the town, and shewde hym-self openly to the peple, as he\nthat of alle peple wolde be seyn.  And than be-gan in the town\na gret tumulte and a merveilouse, and eueriche man seide, \"Lo,\nhere is Merlin.\"  Whan the barouns vndirstode that Merlin was\ncome, they sente after hym; and Merlin come be-fore hem mery\nand gladde.  And whan thei saugh hym comynge, thei yede\na-gein hym, and made of hym grete ioye.  Than thei ledde hym\nin to a paleise vpon the river with-oute the town, in a faire\nmedowe, and brought hym vp to a wyndowe a-lofte, where they\nmyght se faire water, and a grete that yede aboute the wallis of\nkarlion. When the barouns were come thider, they a-resoned Merlin,\nand asked what hym semed of the newe kynge that\nthe archebisshop hadde crowne with-oute her lycence, and\nwith-oute assent of the mene people of the londe?  \"Trewly,\"\nquod Merlyn, \"thei haue don wele, and, knowe it verily, thei\nmyght no better haue don.\"  Than seide the barouns, \"Merlin,\nhow is this that ye sey; ne beth ther many in this reame of\nhigher astate, and worthier men and wise, that were better\nworthi to resceyve that dignyte, than a boy that no man wote\nwhens he is comen?\"  Quod Merlin, \"Ye sey as ye liketh; but,\nknowe this verily, that he is of more gentill linage, and higher\nborn that eny of yow; and I do yow to wete that he is nother\nsone to Antor, ne brother vnto Kay, that he hath made his\nstiwarde, saf only of norture.\"  The barouns seide, \"Merlin, how\nis this that ye sey so?  now go ye more oute of reson than ye were\nwonte to do.\"  Quod Merlin, \"I shall telle yow what ye shull\ndo: ye shull sende to the kynge Arthur, that he come in gode\ntrewis, and Vlfin, the counseiller of Vterpendragon, and Antor,\nthat hath be with Arthur euer vnto this tyme; and than shall ye\nhere the trouthe as it is.\" \"Merlin,\" quod the barouns, \"we will do after thi counseile,\nand we graunte well that he come and go suerly and\nsaf, for so moche that thow doste vs prayen.  But who shall go on this message?\"  Than thei seide, \"Bretel shall go yef\nMerlin assente.\"  \"And I graunte well,\" quod Merlin, \"for he\nshall well do that is nede.\"  Than the barouns called Bretell and\ncharged hym with the massage, and than seide Merlin that\nArthur sholde bringe with hym in his company the\narchebisshop.  Than Bretell com to the maister forteresse where as the kynge\nwas, and seide, \"Sir, the barouns haue sente for yow and the\narchebisshop, and the bisshop of logres, by gode trewys,\" and he\nseide he wolde with gode will go speke with hem.  Than Bretell\nyede to Vlfyn, and seide that Merlin and alle the barouns hadde\nsente for hym that he sholde come with-oute lenger\na-bidinge.  When Vlfin herde that Merlin was come, and that he sente for\nhym to seche, he was glad and ioyfull, for than he knewe well\nthat the trouthe of the kynge sholde be knowen. Than yede thei bothe in to the paleis where as the barouns\na-biden, and Vlfin made gret ioye when he saugh Merlin,\nand than thei spake to-geder of many thinges; and on the tother\nparte come the kynge Arthur and the archebisshop, and Antor that\nmany day hadde hym tendirly norysshed, and come to the paleis\nther as the barons were a-bidinge after hem; but first hadde\nArthur the kynge put on hym an habergon vndir his robes er he\nyede oute of the tour.  And whan he was come be-fore the\nbarouns, thei fonde moche peple that a-bode to hire what Merlin\nwolde sey in audience.  Whan the barouns saugh Arthur comynge,\nthei dressed alle hem a-geyn hym for that he was a kynge\na-noynted and sacred, and for love of the archebisshop, that was\na gode man and holy of lyvinge.  And than thei were alle sette\nsaf, the archebisshop that a-bode stondynge on his feet and seide,\n\"Sirs, for the reuerence of god, haueth pite of cristen feith that\nit be not a-peired thourgh yow, for it were grete damage and\ngrete shame yef be yow it sholde be distresed, and considereth\nthat eche of yow is but oon sole man, and as soone shall the\nhiest and the richest be deed as the porest creature of this\nCitee.\"  \n\"Sir,\" seide the barouns, \"a-bide a-while till we haue herde\nMerlin speke, for hereafter ye may vs preche at leyser, for Merlin\nhath seide to vs a thinge that we haue more merveile of than we hadde euer be-fore.\"  Than the archebisshop sat down, and\nMerlin a-rose vpon his feet and seide, \"Sirs, I haue be-gonne for\nto telle yow whos sone was the kynge Arthur, and I do yow to\nwite alle that beth here that he was the sone of Vterpendragon,\nthat hym engendred on Ygerne the same nyght that her lorde\nwas slayn vpon the brigge, when he issed oute for to assayle the\nkynge Vterpendragon.  And on the morowe, whan the kynge\nwas come a-gein to hys oste, I asked hym that hadde gete on\nthe duchesse that nyght in rewarde of alle seruises that I hadde\nhym don, and he me graunted, that as soone as it were born,\nthat he wolde make that it sholde be delyuered to me, and of\nthis he dide me make letteres, and ther-on hanginge his seal,\nwhiche that Vlfin hath yet in his kepynge in his bailly, and Vlfin\nhym-self was at the couenaunt makynge.  After whan the kynge\nhadde wedded the quene Ygerne, she wax grete with the childe\nthat the kynge hadde gete on her, er he hadde here wedded, and\nso it fill many tymes that the kynge hir blamed and remembred\ndiuerse tymes, and seide that the childe that she was with grete,\nwas not his, wherefore the quene was shamefaste, and discouerid\nto hym the very trouthe, how the childe was be-geten the same\nnyght that the Duke was slain, as ye hau herde; and whan the\nkynge saugh and knewe that she hadde discouerd to hym the\ntrouthe as it was, he dide repente that he hadde made hir in\nhevynesse ther-of, for he loved hir moche more for her grete\ntrouthe, and seide, `Dame, seth it is so, that the childe is not\nmyn in maryage, it were not right that it sholde enherite this\nreame, ne be kynge after me, and therfore I comaunde yow, as\nderely as ye me love, that as soone as ye be delyuered that ye\nmake the childe be deliuered to the firste man that ye mete at\nthe halle dore.'  And the quene dede as he her comaunded, for\nshe wolde in no manere do nothynge that were to hym eny\ndisplesaunce, and so was the childe deliuered to me the same nyght\nthat it was born.\" \"Whan I hadde this childe, I yede to the gode knyght\nthat is here, Antor, and hym I delyuered \u00fee childe,\nand praide hym that it sholde be norisshed vp with his wyfes owne mylke; and so he dide, and put his owne sone, whiche was\nnot fully of half yere age, to be norisshed vp with a-nother\nwoman.  And thus is Kay brother to Arthur, as by hys moder\nbrestes that he dide of sowke, whiche was wif to Antor; for\nVterpendragon hadde hym ther-of tenderly praide be-fore, that\nhe sholde do to the childe as I sholde hym comaunde; and so he\nhath don, god quyte it hym! and dide hym to be baptised, and\ncleped his name Arthur; and yet so is his name.  And therefore,\nlordynges,\" seide Merlin, \"I se well that god doth not for-yete\nhis seruaunte, thow he haue be a synner, yef so be that he will be\nrepentaunte, and hym serue with gode werkes.  And therfore, of\nthe gode fader and the gode moder oure lorde will yelde rewarde\nto the gode seede that of hem issued; for he sente the ston and\nthe swerde, like as ye haue seyn, to make assay to alle the peple,\nwho sholde be kynge.  And therfore, knowe it well alle, that it is\nvery trouthe that I haue yow tolde; and therfore also enquereth\nof Antor, that hath hym norisshed.\"  And than the barouns asked\nyef it were so.  And Vlfyn and Antor seide it was trouthe,\nwith-oute faile.  \"And ther-to,\" quod Vlfin, \"se here the\nletteres and the seall of Vterpendragon ther-on hanginge, that he\nlete make to Merlyn of the couenauntes.\"  And than the\narchebisshop toke the letter, and redde it, herynge alle the peple\neuery worde, as Merlyn hadde rehersed to the barouns.  And\nwhan the peple of the londe herde this merveile, tho many\nbegonne to wepe, and curse alle tho that were a-geyn the kynge\nArthur. Whan the barouns saugh that, and that the mene peple and\nthe clergie hilde with Arthur, thei seide thei wolde\nneuer haue no bastarde to theire kynge, and many other repreves\nand vilonyes thei seide that I will not reherse.  And the\narchebisshop seide he sholde be kynge and haue the reame of logres,\nwho-so-ever ther-to wolde contrarye, seth that it was godes will,\nfor he wolde hym helpe, and mayntene his londe, and to strengthe\nhym in his werre with all his powere.  And whan the\narchebisshop and the mene peple saugh the vntrouth of the barouns,\nthei heilde all to-geder with oon acorde with kynge Arthur. And the barouns fro thens departed in grete wratthe, and badde\nhym to be well ware, and lete hym wite that thei heilde hym\nnot for no kynge; and fro hens-forth thei hym deffien and his\nhelpes.  Than thei yede to theire loggynges, and armed hem,\nand made to arme alle theire peple.  And the kynge Arthur yede\na-gein into the maister toure, and dide arme alle his meyne and\nhis frendes.  And whan thei were alle assembled to-geder, thei\nwere well vij Ml on his partye, what of clerkes and of mene peple,\nbut of knyghtes he hadde but fewe, and of tho that ther were\nit were but pore knyghtes; and to hem he yaf hors and harneise,\nand money to their exspencis; and were of hem iiij C and l. by\ncounte, that seide thei wolde hym helpe, to live and dye with hym. Whan the kynge and his peple were armed, and redy dight,\nthey com to the baill of the toure well arrayde hem to\ndiffende.  And the barouns, as ye haue herde, were at here\nloiginges, to array their peple; and lepen to horsbak, and\nassembled in the town euerych at his baner, and were well viij Ml knyghtes, with-outen seriantz and arblastis, and fotemen grete\nplente.  And whan thei were alle assembled, the barouns asked\nyef thei sholde go assaile the paleise ther the kynge was?  And\nsomme ther-to dide acorde, and somme seide that thei wolde ley\nsiege environ the baile, and shet hem with-ynne, that thei sholde\nneuer be so hardy to ysse out of the toure.  And as thei spake\nthus, com Merlin to hem, and seide, \"Sirs, what is that ye\npurpose to do?  Y do yow to wite ye will gete youre-self the\nwerse, and shull lese ther-on more than ye shull wynne, ffor god\nwill shewe soche wreche, that ye shull be full rebuked and\nfoule shamed, the moste queynte of yow alle; ffor ye beth a-gein\nhym with wronge of the eleccion that the archebisshop hath\nmade, like as ye haue seyn.\"  \"Now hath the enchauntor well\nspoken!\" seide the barouns, and be-gonne for to Iape oon to\na-nother.  And whan Merlin saugh thei made Iapes of his wordes,\nhe returned a-noon a-gein to kynge Arthur, and bad hym he\nsholde nothinge be dismaied, for he sholde not drede hem alle;\nffor he wolde hym helpe so that the moste hardy of hem in the\noste, er it were nyght, sholde wiesshe to be at home in his owne contree.  Than Arthur the archebisshop toke Merlyn, and ledde hym a-parte, and\nthe archebisshop and Antor and Kay and Vlfyn and Bretell, these\nvij were prevely in counseile.  And than seide Arthur to Merlin, \"Dere frende Merlin, I haue herde say that ye loved well\nmy fader, Vterpendragon, as longe as he was lyuinge,\nand therfore I praye yow, for the love of god and for norture,\nthat ye will me counseile in this matere, as ye knowe well these\nbarouns do me grete wronge; and I wolde fayn and it plesed yow\nto be with me as ye were with my fader, and knowe it for\ntrouthe, that I shall neuer do thinge that ought yow to displese\nto my power, and ye haue me holpen in my yowthe and in my\ntendirnesse, and therfore I praye yow helpe to mayntene and to\nstrengthe me to kepe my londe, ffor by yow and by my fader,\nthe archebisshop, and Antor, that hath me norisshed, am I come\nto this that I am atte, and therfore at the reuerense of god haue\npite of me and of the mene peple that alle shull be distroied but\ngod sette remedye.\" \"Now dismaye yow nothinge, sir,\" seide Merlin, \"for ye\nshull not haue no fere of hem; but as soone as ye\nbe deliuerid of these barouns that beth here now come for to\nassaile yow, do that I shall yow rede and counseile.  This is\nthe trouthe, that the knyghtes of the rounde table, that was\nstablisshed and founded in the tyme of Vterpendragon, youre\nfader, on whos soule god haue mercy, thei be gon to soiourne to\ntheir owne contrees, for the grete vntrouthe that thei syen in\nthis reame.  This is in the reame of kynge Leodegan, of Tamalide,\nthat is an olde man and his wif is deed, and of alle his childeren\nis lefte but oon doughter, to whom the reame shall falle after his\ndeth; and the kynge leodegan hath grete werre a-gein the kynge\nRyon, that is kynge of the londe of Geauntes and of the londe of\npastures, whar-in dar noon inhabite for diuerse auentures and\nmerveiles that ther fallith bothe day and nyght. \"This kynge Rion, of whom I speke, is right myghty of londe\nand of peple, and full of high prowesse, and is right a crewell man, and he hath conquered by force xx ti kynges crowned,\nfro whom he hath taken alle their berdes by force and in dispite,\nand sette hem in a mantell, whiche he maketh euery day a\nknyght to hold a-fore hym atte mete, atte alle tymes whan he\nholdeth courte rioall, and he hath sworn that he shall neuer\nfinysshe till he haue conquereth xxx ti kynges.  This kynge\nwerreth vpon leodegan, and in his londe doth grete damage.  This\nleodegan marcheth to thy reame, and yef he lese his londe thow\nshalt lese thyn after; and vndirstonde well that he sholde haue\nloste his londe longe er this tyme ne were the knyghtes of the\nrounde table that mayntened his werre, for he is now in grete\nage, and therfore I rede that thow go and serue hym a-while,\nthe kynge leodegan, and he shall yeve the his doughter to be thy\nwif, to whom the reame longeth after his deth, and she is right\nfeire and yonge, and the wisest lady of the worlde of so yonge\nage; and of thy londe haue thow no doute, for eche of these\nbarouns that now werreth vpon the, thei shull haue so moche to\ndo, that litill shull thei forfete in thy londe, but passinge thourgh\nthe playn contrees; but er thow go, do garnysshe thy forteresses\nof euery Citee, and euery castell, with vitayle, and men, and\nstuffe of other artrye; and the archebisshop shall a-curse alle tho\nthat in thy londe eny thinge forfete a-gein the or in thy contree;\nand the archebisshop hym-self shall shewe the cursynge in sight\nof alle the barouns that now ben here, and comaunde alle the\nclergie to do the same in heringe of hem alle, and soone after ye\nshall se soche thinges, by the helpe of god, that the proudest of\nhem shall be affraide.  And wite ye well that I will be redy\nwith yow in euery grete nede; and whan I crye to yow, `Now\nvpon hem,' set forth boldely and smyte in a-monge hem, and wite\nit verily that thei shull be so a-baisshed that litill thei shall yow\ndisese, but alle thei shull be fayn to fle as discounfite.\" \"Sire,\" seide the kynge, \"gramercy!\" and than thei\ndeparted.  And the archebisshop wente vpon the walles\non high, and the kynge Arthur dide his peple make hem redy\nand lepe on horse, and in that maner-wise thei a-bide longe\ntyme.  And Merlin made to kynge Arthur a baner wher-in was grete significacion, for ther-in was a dragon, which he made sette on a\nspere, and be semblaunce he caste oute of his mouth fire and\nflame, and he hadde a grete taile and a longe.  This dragon no\nman cowde wite where Merlin it hadde, and it was merveilouse\nlight and mevable; and whan it was set on a launce thei\nbeheilde it for grete merveile.  Than toke the kynge the dragon,\nand yaf it to Kay, his stiwarde, in soche forwarde that he be\nchef banerer of the reame of logres euer while his lif doth\ndure.  Thus arraied thys mayne the kynge Arthur, and a-bode in soche\nmaner on horsbak be-fore the yate be-fore the paleis, and the barouns\nmade picche her teynte and pavelouns thourgh the medowes\nthat were large and faire.  And whan the archebisshop that\nsaugh, he asked what thei were come to seche so armed; and\nthei seide that thei were come to take the maister toure, which\nthei wolde no man sholde be Inne but by hem. Than the archebisshop yaf the scentence full dolerouse, and\ncursed of god and with all his power alle tho that in\nthe londe dide eny forfet, or were a-gein the kynge Arthur.  And\nthe barons seide that for eny cursinge thei wolde not cesse till\nthei hadde dryve the kynge oute of the londe; and yef thei\nmyght hym take, thei lete hym knowe that he sholde not escape\nwith-oute the deth.  And whanne Merlin vndirstode their\nbobaunce, he caste his enchauntement, so that alle their logges\nand pavilouns were alle on fire a-flame.  And thei ther-of were\nso a-baisshed that hem dought longe er thei myght gete out in to\nthe medowes fro the fyre; but er thei myght come ther, thei\ncaught grete harme, and foule were thei skorched with the\nfier.  Merlin ran to the kynge, and seide, \"Sir, now hastely vpon\nthem!\"  And thei spronge oute at the yate, as moche as theire\nhorse myght renne, the speres on their asseles, theire sheldes\nbe-fore her bristes.  And thei were so a-baisshed and affraide that\nthe moste hardy of hem wolde fain haue be thens; ffor thei\nwende not that ther hadde be so moche peple with-Inne; for thei\nwith-oute were sodenly many of hem born down with speres,\nand moche peple slain; ffor thei were so astoned with the hete of\nthe fier that theire deffence was but symple.  There was grete slaughter of men and horse.  Ther dide Arthur merveillouse\ndedes of armes, that gretly he was be-holden, bothe on that\noon part and on the tother; he ouerthrewe knyghtes, bothe\nhorse and man, with stroke of spere and of swerde.  And ther-to\nhadde the princes and barouns grete enuye, and assembled hem\nto-geder, and seide that it were grete shame yef he so\nescaped.  And thei were noble knyghtes and hardy, and full of high\nprowesse, and many of hem carnell frendes.  Than seyde kynge\nVentres of garlot that he wolde hem delyuere in short tyme, for\nyef Arthur oonly were deed, the werre of the remenaunt were\nsoone fynysshed.  \"Goth on,\" seide the othir prynces, \"and yef\nye haue myster we shall yow socoure.\"  Ther-with departed the\nkynge Ventres and his company, that was a moche man of body,\nand a gode knyght and yonge, of prime barbe; and he was\nmervelouse stronge, and he helde a shorte grete growen spere, sharp\ngrounden, and rode agein Arthur. Whan Arthur saugh hym come, he dressed a-gein hym his\nhorse hede, and griped a grete aisshen spere, the heede\nsharp trenchaunt of stiell; than smote the horse with the spores,\nthat it ran so faste and so briaunt, that alle hadden merveile that\nit be-helden.  And he afficched hym so in the sturopes that the\nhorse bakke bente, and smote to-geder so hetely vpon the sheldes\nthat thei preced thourgh.  The kynge Ventres brake his spere\nvpon kynge Arthur, and Arthur smot hym a-gein so sore that he\nbar hym ouer the horse croupe, and his legges vp-right, that the\nerthe rebounded, but he hadde noon other hurte.  And whan the\nkynge loth of Orkanye saugh the kynge Ventres ouerthrowen, he\nwas wroth and sorowfull, for thei were bothe cosin germains,\nand also thei hadde wedded two sustres.  Than smote he the\nhorse with spores a-gein Arthur, that yet hadde he his spere\nhoill.  And whan he saugh the comynge of kynge loth, he come a-gein\nwith grete hardinesse, as he that of hym hadde no dowte; and\nmette to-geder on the sheldis, so that the horse ne myght not\npasse ferther till the tymbres were broken; and on the passinge\nforth thei hurtelid to-geder so fiercely, with sheldes and with her\nbeyes and her helmes, that the kynge loth was so astonyed that he fley ouer his horse crowpe.  Than a-roos grete noyse and cry\non the oon part and the tother.  Ther be-gan a grete stoure and\nmerveillouse.  The knyghtes that were with kynge Ventres\npeyned hem sore to socoure their lorde, and so dide the knyghtes\nof kynge loth; and Arthurs knyghtes peyned hem sore to helpe\nArthur, and to take and holde these other two kynges.  And so\nbe-gan the medle on bothe parteis crewell and fellenouse.  But\nwith grete peyne were these two kynges rescowed and horsed\na-gein.  Whan Arthur was releved, he drowgh his swerde oute of\nskabrek, whiche was so cler and bright shynynge as thei semed\nthat it be helden that it glistred as it hadde be the brightnesse of\nxx ti tapres brennynge.  And it was the same swerde that he\ntoke oute of the ston; and the letteres that were write on the\nswerde seide that the right name was cleped Escaliboure, whiche\nis a name in ebrewe, that is to sey in englissh, kyttynge, Iren,\ntymber, and steill; and the letteres seide trewe, as ye shall\nheeren here-after.  whan the kynge Arthur hadde drawen oute\nhis swerde, he smote in to the prese, ther as he saugh thikkeste,\nand smote a knyght on the sholder, so that he made it discendir\nfrom the body; the stroke was grete and the swerde trenchaunt,\nso that he slyt a-sonder the sadell and the chyne of the horse, that\nbothe the knyght and the horse fill on an hepe.  And than he\nsmote a-boute hym grete strokes bothe on the lefte syde and on\nthe right side, and made so grete occision a-boute hym that all\nthat it syen helde it grete merveile, and ne durste not a-bide his\nstrokes, but made wey and voided place for drede of his swerde\nand of his fell strokes. Whan the vij kynges saugh the damage and the grete losse\nthat they hadde thourgh hym, thei were wroth and\nright sorowfull, and seyde eche to other, \"Now let vs alle sette\non hym attones, and bere hym down to the erthe, for elles may\nwe nothynge conquere;\" and to this thei acorded.  Than thei\nhenten speres grete and rude, and ronnen a-gein hym with as\ngrete ranndon as their horse myght hem bere, and smyten hym\non the shelde and on the haubrek, but is so stronge and sure that\nno mayle ne perced; but thei bar to hym so harde that Arthur was throwe to the erthe, bothe he and his horse on oon\nhepe.  And whan Kay and Antor and Vlfin and Bretell, and other of\nArthurs frendes syen this, Antor hasted hym to kynge Carados,\nand met hym so hedylyche with a grete spere, that bothe the\ntymbir and stelen heede shewed thourgh his shuldre, and threwe\nbothe hym and his horse to the erthe, and lay longe in\nswowne.  And Vlfyn and kynge Ventres of Garlot mette so sore to-geder,\nthat ether bar other to the grounde, and the horse vpon\nhem.  And the kyge ydiers and bretell brake their spers that oon vpon\nthe tother, with-oute more harme doynge.  And alle the tother\nbarouns a-bode vpon the kynge Arthur, that yet lay at the erthe\nall stonyed, and thei smote on his helme grete storkes and pesaunt,\nso that thei made hym moche more astonyd.  And whan Kay\nsaugh that the kynge was at so grete myschef, he griped his\nswerde, and come ther the kynge was ouer-throwen, and smote\nthe kynge loth vpon the helme that he made hym stoupe on the\narson of his sadell, and leyde on hym so grete strokes that loth\nall astonyed, fill to the grounde.  Than come thei to the rescowe,\nbothe on the oon and on the tother.  Ther was grete bataile, and\nstronge stour, and grete slaughter, bothe of men and horse; and\nso peyned thei that were with kynge Arthur, that thei haue\nhym remounted on his horse; but firste hadde thei grete payne\nand traveile and grete losse, ffor the meene peple of the town\nwere come oute with all wepen that thei myght haue\ndeffensable.  And the cry and the noyse rose thourgh all the contre, so that\nalle the commons hasted thider all that myghten, and seiden that\nthei wolden alle be deed on the same grounde, er that kynge\nArthur hadde eny greef, as longe as thei myghten hym\ndeffende.  Than they smyten in a-monge the preesse of the vij kynges, that\nmany thei dide sle and wounde, and so put hem to flight, whether\nthey wolde or noon.  And so thei yede discounfited , but thei\nseiden thei sholde neuer haue gladnesse till they were venged,\nand that they wolde not take of Arthur but his heed. The kynge Arthur, that was full wrothe, and Kay hem chased\nfercely be-fore alle other.  And so fill it that Arthur\nouer-toke kynge ydiers, and wende to smyte hym on the helme, but the horse bar hym to faste, so that the stroke descended on\nthe horse and slyt hym euen a-sondre be-hynde the sadill, and\nydiers and his horse blusshet to the erthe; wherefore his men\nwere gretely affraied leste he hadde be slain, and returned hym\nto rescowe, ther be-gan the stour grete and merveillouse, for that\noon part peyned to with-holde and to take kynge ydiers, and on\nthe to-ther syde thei peyned hym to rescowe, and so was ther do\nmore damage and harme than hadde be all the day be-fore, ffor\nther was neyther horse ne man that myght endure agein the\nswerde of Arthur, that was cleped Calibourne, that was all\nblody of brain and blode so that his armes were so steyned that\nnought was seid but all reade.  Neuertheless, so peyned ydiers\nmen that they haue hym remounted on horse-bak, and so ben\nthei departed discounfited, and the chase lasted longe tyme, and\nso the vij kynges losten I-nough, for of all the harneys that thei\nhade brought thider, thei hadde not with hem the valew of ijd,\nthat all ne was brente with the fier that Merlin made discende\namonge theire tentes and pauelouns, saf only the vessels of golde\nand siluer and the money.", "7": "CHAPTER VIII. THE MISSION OF ULFYN AND BRETELL TO KING BAN AND KING BORS. When kynge Arthur hadde discounfited the vij kynges, by the\nhelpe of god and of Merlin, like as ye haue herde, he\nreturned to Cardoell, in Walis, whan he hadde be at Karlion,\nand sente after sowderes ouer all, and yaf hem wagis, and horse,\nand harneyse, and robes, and so he be-come in grete love a-monge\nthe pore knyghtes of the contree, so that thei assured hym and\nsworn that thei wolde hym neuer fayle while their lives endured.\nAfter this that Arthur hadde so don that hadde gete the hertes\nof moche peple.  Than he stuffed his castelles, and townes, and\nCitees, and after heilde courte at logres, his chief Citee, that now\nis cleped london.  This was on oure lady day in septembre, at this courte that the kynge heilde, he lete make many newe\nknyghtes with his owne honde, whiche alle dide hym homage\nand fewtee; and than he yaf hem londes and riche yeftes, so\nthat thei myght hem well mayntene and gouerne.  And so the\nkynge gate hym grete love, so that fro thens-forth thei dide hym\nneuer faile for no drede of deth.  And so hadde he of his peple\ngrete socoure and helpe, as ye shull here her-after. After this that the kynge hadde made CCC knyghtes, as the\nstory reherseth, and that he hadde stuffed alle his\ncastelles with soche men as that Merlyn hadde yoven hym counseile,\nthan Merlin toke hym in counseile, and seide\u2014but at the\ncounseile was Vlfyn, that right moche hym loved.  And Merlyn\nseide, \"Sir, I knowe a thinge that I will shewe to yow, and\ntelle yow my customes; this is the trouthe:\u2014 Ther is a man in\nNorthumbirlonde, whiche is an hermyte, in the moste wilde place\nof all the foreste, and he is gretly my frende, and moche I hym\nlove, for he deffended my moder oon tyme fro the deth; and I\nwill telle yow how.\"  Than be-gan he to reherse his moder lif,\nand how she was ledde to be brente for a blame that was put\nvpon hir; and how Vortiger dide hym seche for his tour; and\nhis moder was a nonne in an abbey where as he her lefte; and\nhow the tour dide holde that Vortiger lete make; and the\nsignificacion of the two dragouns, how that oon dide sle the tother;\nand how after the deth of Vortiger how he was a-queynted with\nPendragon and Vter, and of the grete bataile where as\nPendragon was slayn; and after how he was with his broder\nVterpendragon, and how he made hym to ly with the duchesse Ygerne\nin the castell of Tintagell; and how he made the kynge in\nsemblaunce of the duke hir husbonde, whan Arthur was be-geten;\nand how that Vlfyn devised the mariage of Vterpendragon and\nthe quene youre moder, whiche hadde v doughteres by the Duke,\nhir husbonde, and two by hir firste husbonde; wherof the kynge\nloth hath oon doughter to his wyf, and the kynge Ventres of\nGarlot a-nother, and the kynge Vrien the thirthe, and Briadas\nthe forthe, whiche is deed, and he was fader to Agnysas of\nScotlonde; and the fyfthe is yet at logres in gret bretein, at scole, whiche lerneth wele, and is right wise and connynge in grete\nclergie.  And wite well that the kynge loth hath v sones by\nhis wif, of whiche thow didest engendre that oon at logres whan\nthow were a squyer.  And alle thei be feire yonge squyres, and\nthe eldest hight Gawein.  And wite thow well that he shall be\nthe trewest knyght of all the worlde a-gein his lorde; also he\nshall be oon of the beste knyghtes of the worlde, and moste\nshall the love while his lif doth endure, and shall the helpe agein\nall the worlde and agein his owne fader; and ne doute not\nthourgh hym shalt thow haue a-gein all thy londe, and also alle\nthy men that for drede of hym shull be full meke and fain to\nobbeye to the; where thourgh thow shalt ouer-come thyn\nenmyes, and also be the helpe of his brothern, whiche shull be\nso noble knyghtes.  And the kynge Ventres of Garlot, that is so\ngode a knyght, hath a-nother sone by his wif that is thy suster\nalso; and he is a fayre yonge squyre, and is I-cleped\nGaleshyn.  And kynge Vrien hath a-nother that hight Ewein le gaunte, that\nshall the helpe; and he hath alle bountees bothe of herte and\nbody.  These shull the love and serve euer to the deth; and wite thow\nwell that thei shull neuer be dubbed of no man till thow a-dubbe\nhem and yeve hem armes.  Thise shull make the a-queynted with\nmany a gentilman that ben of high lynage, that for love of hem\nand of her company shull the serue as longe as thei shall\nlyve.  And on that other side, in litill Breteyne, ben two kynges,\nwhich ought to be thy men; and they haue wedded two sustres\nto their wyfes, and owen to holden their londes of the; and thei\nbe men of high lynage, and be bretheren germain.  These two\nbretheren shull haue sones whiche shull be merveilouse gode\nknyghtes, that in no londe shall be founde noon better.  That\noon of these two kynges is cleped the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and\nthe tother is cleped the kynge Bors of Gannes.  But thei haue an\neuell neighbour that marched nygh to theire remes, and he is a\nkynge, and werreth vpon hem, and shall yet here-after do hem\ngrete peyne and traueyle for enuye; and for that he may not\nhem now Iustice and ouerlede, and for that thei be so worthy\nknyghtes and so trewe.  I will thow sende to hem, that thei come to thy courte, and that thow woldes hem se, and with\nhem be aqueynted, and sey that gretely thow desirest her\naqueyntance, and that thei be here at halowmesse, for than shalt\nthow holde thy courte at logres, and sende to alle the noble men\nof thi londe that will to the obbeyen.  And somme shull come for\ngode, and some for euell; but thise two kynges shull come by\ntheire debonertee, for thei be full worthy men and right\ntrewe.  And therfore, loke thow, a-queynte the with hem, and offre hem\nthy servyse, and thei shull conne the grete thanke, and thei\nshull do to the homage full gladly; and when thi courte shall\ndeparte, telle to hem thi counseile, and sey how thow wilte go in\nto Carmalide, to serve the kynge leodogan; and therfore lede\nhem with the, for thei be full noble knyghtes, and full of\nmerveilouse high prowesse; and thow shall haue to hem grete\nmystere at thy repeyre a-geyn in to this londe, for thyn enmyes\nwolde deffende the fro the londe; but ther-to shall thei not\nendure ne haue power for the helpe of these two kynges that\nshull be in thy company.  And I will well that thow wite\nmy condiciouns be, that I gladly repeire in to forestes and\nwildernesse, by the nature of hym that me be-gat, for he loveth not to\nhaue the company that is of godes be-halue; But I ne go not for\nhis sake, but for the love of Blase, the holy hermyte.  And\nknowe it verily that in every nede that thow haste, I shall\nredily be with the, to helpe the and counseile; but ofte tymes\nshalt thow se me in other semblaunce than thow doste now,\nfor I will not that alle peple knowe me whan I speke with\nhem, or whan I speke with the; but I will that thow\nswere that thow shall not me discouer to no man of thynge\nthat I sey to the, ffor yef thow me discure thow shalt haue\ntherby more damage than thow woldest trowe.\"  And the\nkynge Arthur swhore to hym with gode will, like as he dide\ndevyse, as he that was full ioyfull to haue his a-queytaunce and\ncompanye, and seide that neuer wolde he sey, ne do nothynge\nthat sholde to hym displese by his power.  And than Merlin\nhym assured of his londe, and seide he wolde helpe hym so well\nthat he wolde deserue of hym grete thanke. Thus Arthur sente Vlfin and Bretell for kynge ban and kynge\nbors, hys brother, and sente hem worde that as dere as thei hym loved, to come to hym to logres in grete Breteyne, at\nthe feste of halowmasse; ffor these two knyghtes were well\na-queynted with these two kynges that thei wente to seche, for\nmoche thei to-geder loveden, and well were aqueynted in the tyme\nof Vterpendragon.  And thei passed ouer the see, and come in to\nlitill Breteyne, and com thourgh the londe that was all wasted; and\nthey fonde many townes brente and distroied.  And so they come\nto a Citee that was cleped Beynoyk, that now is cleped Burges in\nbarre, and be-longinge to kynge Claudas de la deserte. This kynge Claudas of whom I speke claymeth a Castell that\nthe kynge Ban hath closeth in his londe.  And Claudas\nseide that the londe was his, and the kynge Ban seide, \"Nay.\"\nAnd so be-gan the werre be-twene hem, grete and merveilouse,\nand longe endured the mortall hate be-twene hem, as longe as\nthir life dured.  And so Claudas ran thourgh the lodes of\nkynge ban er he hadde hym warned, and so he dide hym grete\ndamage of prisoners that he toke in the Contree, and in townes\nthat he fonde vn-walled, whiche he brente and distroied, and\nmade grete slaughter of his peple, as he that was with-oute\npitee, of that he myght haue the hier honde.  But to the Castell\nthat kynge ban hadde do closed, myght he nothinge do, for it\nwas right stronge.  This castell hadde kynge ban well stuffeth\nwith men of werre, and in the maister forteresse hadde he sette at Castelein, a right noble man and a trewe, that was cleped\nGrascien, and made his compere a godsone of hys, that he hadden\nhoue fro the fontstone, and was cleped after the kynge ban\nBawdewyn, whiche was after full renomede, and full of grete\nprowesse in the reame of logres, and in many other contrees,\nwhere as he dide many grete dedes of armes, of whiche is yet\nmade no mencion, till that my mater com ther-to.  But speketh\nof kynge ban, that was sorowfull and wroth for the damage that\nkynge Claudas hadde hym don with-oute diffyinge.  And than he\nassembled his power, and yede hym a-geyns in all the haste that\nhe myght, at a passage that he sholde come by. When thise two hostes sholde mete ther was right grete\nbataile, and stronge stour, and grete slaughter on both\npartyes, for the kynge ban slough so many with his owne honde\nthat the hepes lay in the feilde as it hadde be dede swyne or\nshepe.  And so bar hym the kynge ban and his peple that the\nkynge claudas was putt to flight, and loste all his harneyse and his\npraye, and the prisoners that they hadde taken were rescowed.  And\non that othir syde, on that side that marched to gawnes, the kynge\nbors and his men entred and brente and distroide the londes of\nthe kynge Claudas euen to the yates of his chief Citee that\ncleped la deserte, and toke alle the prisoners that he\nmyght.  And so he distroied all as he wente thourgh the contre, that\nwith-ynne lx myle ye sholde not fynde an house in to herberowe\nbut it were in roches or in seleres vnder erthe, but other\nhabitacion sholde ye noon fynde.  And so was Claudas made pore and\nmaat.  And by that distruxion Claudas heilde hym so coy that\nhe druste not werre no more in theire londes longe tyme after; and\nafter that he greved the two brethern more than thei dide hym,\nas ye shull here her-after.  And so the messagers of Arthur\nfonde the contree distroied like as ye haue herde; and thei\nmerveiled gretly how this myght be.  And thei rode forth till thei\ncome to Trebes, the castell that the kynge ban hadde do closed,\nwhiche was right stronge, and stode on a high grounde. In this castell was the quene Elein, the wyf of kynge ban of\nBenoyk, which was a gode lady and of holy\nlivynge.  And ther-to she was of wonder grete bewte, so that noon was\nfounden feirer in no contre; and ther-to was she yonge, of the\nage of xvj yere, and hadde be but litill while be-fore be maried\nto the kynge Ban.  And the kynge Boors hadde wedded the\nto-ther suster, that was a gode lady and gentell, and was the\nyongest of the two quenes.  And whan Vlfin and Bertell come to\nTrebes, thei axed after the kynge Ban; and the peple seide he\nwas at parlament with his brother kynge Boors of Benoyk.  And\nwhan thei vndirstode this, thei toke leve of the quene Elein and\ndeparted fro thens all armed, for the contre that thei sholde passe\nthourgh was not sure, for men of werre that ran thourgh the londe.  And more thei wolde haue don, but for drede of the two\nbrethern that were kynges.  And thei kepten streite Iustice, ffor\nalle tho that myght be take with eny forfet or robbery, thei\nwere a-noon putte to Iustyse and distroide with-oute\nrespite.  Whan these two messagers departed fro Trebes a five mile, thei\nsaugh vij knyghtes of Claudas, men that repayreden thourgh the\nContree to assaye yef thei myght ought wynne vpon the kynge\nbors or on the kynge Ban; but the contre was so voyde that\nthey fonde nought to take, ffor the peple were fledde to stronge\nCitees and to stronge Castelles with all that thei hadden.  Whan\nthe two massagers saugh the vij knyghtes, than seide oon to\na-nother of he vij, \"See yonder two knyghtes, be-holde whiche\nhorse thei ride; grete foles were we yef we sholde lete hem thus\npasse!\"  Than seide oon, \"It semeth well that thei be not of\nthis contree, for thei bere not the armes of this londe ne as\nknyghtes of this reame.\"  \"Trewly,\" quod oon of hem,\n\"what-so-euer thei be, they seme to be worthy men, bothe by their\narmes and by theyr horses; and yef thei be in seruise, it sheweth\nwell that they serue a gode lorde.\"  \"What forse,\" quod\na-nother, \"what-euer thei be, lete vs go take from hem\ntheire horse and theire harneys, for ther-to haue we grete nede.\"\nAnoon oon of hem smote the horse with the spores, and ran\ncryinge after these messagers, and seide, \"Sirs!  ne passe no\nferther, for yef ye do ye be but deed, yef ye be longynge to the\nkynge Ban or to the kynge Boors; but and yef ye be with the\nkynge Claudas, than haue ye no drede; for we kepe the weyes\nand the passages of this marche, that noon ne a-scape that is\na-gein Claudas.  And therfore we aske of yow the trewage, after\nthe custom that we vse; for wite it well yow be-houeth to leve\nwith vs youre horse and youre armes, and ye ascape, so ye may\nconne vs grete thanke; but for that vs semeth that ye worthy\nmen, we lete yow passe a-lyve with-oute inprisonment, with this\nraunsom, to lese youre horse and youre harneyse.\"  Whan Vlfyn\nvndirstode his manasynge, he seide, \"Sir knyght, ne haste not to\nsore, for yet thow may come all be tyme.  I knowe nought what\nthow arte, but thow arte a bolde speker, and also a grete a-vauntour; and ille happe haue he that vylenis knyght that asketh\neny tribute of eny trauellynge knyghtes; and thow arte nothynge\ncurteyse.  And wite thow well that thow shalt nother haue oure horse ne oure harneyse so lyghtly as thow wenest, but er\nthow hem gete, thei shull be right dere solde.\"  And when\nBretel vndirstode how Vlfin spake to the knyght, he seide, \"Sir knyght , in euyll tyme hast thou asked vs tribute.\"  Than smote\nhe the horse with the spores ageyn hym, and that other knyght\ncom hym a-gein, gripynge his spere in the fewtre.  And thei\nsmeten to-geder vpon the sheldes so sore that they perced thourgh,\nand the spere heede of the knyght stynte on Breteles\nhaubrek.  And Bretell smote hym a-gein, that with so grete ravayn that the\nspere ran thourgh his left sholder that the heed shewede a span\nbe-hynde.  And he bar on hym so sore that he threwe the knyght\nto grounde, and his horse vpon hym.  And he swowned for\nthe grete anguyssh that he felte.  And Bretell drowgh oute a-gein\nhis spere that yet was hool.  And than seide he to the knyght in\nscorne, \"Sir knyght, now maist thow loigge here be leyser, and\nkepe these weyes, that noon ne ascape with-oute paiynge of\ntrewage.\"  And than he rode a walop after Vlfyn, gripynge his\nspere.  And Vlfin saugh wele the Iustynge of hym and of the\nknyght, and ther-of he was gladde, and moche he preysed\nBretell.  And whan thei were come to-geder, thei rode fourth a\nsofte paas.  Whan the vj knyghtes saugh theire lorde\nouerthrowen and wounded, thei were sorowfull, and seide that neuer\nsholde thei be gladde er thei were a-venged.  Than two of hem\nrenged hem, and priked after the messagers as faste as the horse\nmyght hem bere.  And whan thei approched, thei ascryde hem,\nand manaced hem crewelly.  And whan the messagers saugh\nhem two a-gein two, they returned her hedes, and bowed vnder\ntheire sheldes as thei that were gode knyghtes and sure.  And\nthey mette to-geder alle foure, with alle theire myght of horse\nand man, and smyte to-geder with sperres in the sheldes, so that\nthei fley on peces.  And Bretell bar his spere so high that he smote his felow a-bove the shilde, that the haubrek rente, so that\nhe sente the hede and the shafte thourgh his throte, and so he\nfill to grounde vp-right.  And Vlfyn hitte so his felowe thourgh\nshelde and haubreke, that the spere hede wente thourgh the lyfte\nsholder, that he fill to the erthe ouer his horse crowpe. After this made them redy two of the tother foure for to\nouer-take them that hadde theire felowes slayn.  They\nascryde the two messagers, and seide that thei sholde dye for\nthei wolde a-venge theire felowes at hir power.  And whan they\nsaugh hem come, thei turned the hedes of theire horse, and that\noon requyred the tother to do well.  And than thei mette\nto-geder in a valey, and Vlfyn lete renne to hym that com a-gein\nhym, and Bretell a-gein the tother.  The two knyghtes brake theire\nsperes vpon the two massagers; and Bretell smote so his felowe\nthat he slyt ther shilde and the haubrek to rente, that the spere\nyede thourgh the body, and bar hym to grounde all blody and\ndeed.  And Vlfyn smote his felowe so sore that he fill to the\nerthe, and his horse on his body, and in the fallynge he brake\nhis nekke.  Than seide Bretell to hem, \"Sirs, now may ye\nmanace vs, and ther-to I yeve yow leve to kepe the weyes and\nthe passages.\"  At these wordes lowgh Vlfin for merthe.  Than\nyede these two massagers forth theire wey, and trauaylde forth\nall the day wery, and for the traueile of the bataile that thei\nhadde agein the knyghtes, so that by euen thei come to Benoyk,\nwhere thei fonde grete plente of peple; ffor the kynge ban\nhadde sente for the kynge Boors his brother, and hys barouns with\nhym, that moste were of his counseile.  The two messagers rode\nthourgh the town, till thei come to the maister paleise, and ther\nthei a-lighten, and toke theire horse and their armes to a squyre\nto kepe, that thei hadde brought with hem with-oute mo\nmeyne.  Than yede thei vp in to the paleise, and asked after kynge Ban\nand his brother the kynge Boors.  And it was tolde hem how they\nwere in a chamber in counseile soole by hem-self.  And than\nwere the messagers gladde that thei hadde hem founden so to-geder.  And thei a-bode till that the two kynges hadde made\nende of her counseile.  And as they a-bode so, com to hem a\nknyght that highte Leones, and brought with hym a knyght that\nhe moche loved, and his name was Pharien.  Thise tweyne come\nto the messagers, and hem asked what thei were, and thei\nansuerde that thei sholde sone knowe, yef it plesed hem to a-byde\nso longe till thei hadde seide theire message to the two\nkynges.  And when these other herde hem so sey, thei a-vised hem better,\nand knewe hem wele.  And than thei toke hem in armes, and\nmade hem grete ioye, as thei that longe tyme had to-geder loved\nfrom theire childehode.  And than thei asked yef thei hadde\ngrete haste; and thei ansuerde, \"Ye, right grete.\"  Than thei\ntoke them be the hande, and ledde hem in to the chamber where\nthe two kynges weren, and whan the two kynges hem saugh,\nthei yede hem a-geins, for thei knewe well, that soone after\nsholde they here tydynges, and Leonces a-resonde hem, and seide\nto the two brethern, and seide, \"Lo, here two messagers of the\ngrete Breteyne that beth come to speke with yow.\"  And the\nkynges seide they were welcome; and than thei made of hem\ngrete ioye, as thei that moche hem loved, and than thei seeten\ndown, and than the kynge ban asked what nede hadde brought\nhem in to that contre, for with-outen cause ye be not come hider;\nand after he axed of tydinges of the londe that thei come fro,\nand yef the barons hadde yet a kynge after her in-tente, for well\nknewe thei of the stryfe and of the eleccion, and how the swerde\nand the ston that apered on the feeste of yoole be-fore the\nmynster. Than the messagers tolde hem trouthe all as it\nhadde be by-twene the kynge Arthur and the vij kynges,and\nthe grete damage that Merlin dide hem with the fire, and how\ngrete merveiles of armes the yonge kynge dide; and after thei\nseide their message, how Arthur hadde sente hem to seche, be the\ncounseile of Merlin, and whan they hadde seide all their message\nfro the be-gynynge to the ende, Vlfin praide hem to take here\ncounseile, and to yeve hem ansuere hastely, for the terme was but shorte, and theire nede grete.  And the two brethern that\nwere kynges seide that they were greved gretly with a werre,\nthat they hadde agein the kynge Claudas, \"and  therfore we drede when whan   we be oute of the Contree, that they falle not vpon vs, for\nso myght we haue grete damage.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the messagers,\n\"that ne wolde we not, but Merlin sente yow worde, that ye\nsholde haue no drede as longe as ye be in this viage.\" Whan the two kynges vndirstode that, that thei hadde seide,\nthey merveiled moche of Merlin that thus knewe of the\nthynges that shull be-falle; and than they graunted to the\nMessagers the thei sholde meve the thirde day, and thei hem thanked\nwith gode herte.  Than thei made hem to vn-arme hem, for the\nkynge ban wolde not haue at noon other osteill, but in his\nhouse; and whan thei vn-harneysed, theire armour was\ngretly be-holde, and they seiden alle that the messagers hadde\nbut litill be by the fire ne stonde be the chymney.  Than the two\nkynges come to hem and asked hem where theire sheldes hadde\nbe so arrayed, and chargede hem be the feith that they ought\ntheire lorde, that thei sey the trouthe.  Than they tolde how\nthey were assailed by vij knyghtes, and all as it was  be-falle, as\nye haue herde be-fore, \"and,\" quod they, \"thanked be god we\nhaue do so that we beth now here.\"  And whan the two kynges\nherde that they were so delyuered fro the vij knyghtes, they\npraysed hem gretly, neuertheles they knewe wele that they were\nworthy knyghtes, and gode men and trewe.  Than made the\nkynge Ban the messagers to be sette, and serued with riche\nseruyse and deynte metes, as he that wele cowde it do, and\nLeonces and Pharien moche peyned hem to serue and make chere,\nfor longe hadde thei be aqueynted to-geder in the grete Breteyne\nin the tyme of Vterpendragon.  A-noon kynge Ban and his brother\narayed hem to move the thirde day, and Comaunded theire londes\nin the kepynge of Leonces, and Pharien, that was theire cosyn\ngermayn, and a gode man and right a trewe; and Pharien in his\ncompanye, and the stywarde of Benoyk, and they of the reame of Gannes, whiche were full worthy men; and the two kynges\ncomaunded hem, yef they hadde nede, that they sholde sende to\nhem for socour, and lete hem wete how it was with hem.  And\nthe kynge ban toke gode tokenes that they sholde sende to the\nbarouns of the londe, yef nede were, and the tokene was a rygne\nof hys fynger, that who-so brought hem that rynge they sholde\nyeve credence to the message that it brought.  And than thei\ndeparted, and sped so here Iourneys that thei com to the see, and entred in to the shippes, and passed ouer with-oute eny\nlettynge.  But now cesseth the tale of hem, and returneth to\nspeke of kynge Arthur, that is lefte at Logres.", "8": "CHAPTER IX. THE VISIT OF KING BAN AND KING BORS TO ARTHUR; AND THE TOURNAMENT AT LOGRES. Now, seith the storye, that whan the messagers were departed\nfrom Arthur,and that he hadd stuffed his Citees and euery\ncastell with soche peple as that Merlin hadde hym counseiled,\nfor he knewe well whiche were gode and trewe, and he wiste\nalso whiche were with-oute treson.  And whan all this was don,\nMerlin come to hym and seide, \"Sir, be gladde and mery, for\nVlfin and Bretell haue well do theire message.\"  And than Merlin\ntolde what aventre hem fill by the wey, and how they were\nassailed of vij knyghtes, and how thei hem delyuerd, and how\nthey haue spoke with the two kynges, and how thei be now\nentred in to the see, and how thei haue lefte here londes in\nkepynge of the two knyghtes, and also of the tokene of the\nrynge.  \"Now, beith well a-vised that ye resceyve hem so\nwurshipfully as soche high men and grete of astate and high renon,\nand they ought to be youre men, and they beth I-born of the\nhighest lynage of the worlde, and moche higher than ye be youre\nself, and so be theire wyves also.\"  And the kynge seide to\nMerlin, \"I pray yow telle me how I shall do and how I shall me contene, and I shall do as ye me comaunde.\"  Thanne Merlin\ntaught hym how he sholde do: \"hange the stretes ther thei sholde\ncome with riche clothes, and make alle the dameselles to synge\ncarolles and to go ageins hem synginge oute of the town, and ye\nyoure self shall ride agein hem.\"  \"And whan shull they come?\"\nseide the kynge.  Quod Merlin, \"They shall be here on sonday er\npryme.\"  And the kynge seide he wolde do as he hadde devised,\nand Merlin taught hym all how he sholde hym gouerne.  Thanne\nArthur made his ordenaunce to resceyve the two kynges, and\na-bode in soche wise to the sonday.  And the kynge and hys\nbarouns were on horse bak, and the archebisshop yede a-gein hem\nwith grete procession; and ther as they dide mete, grete was\nthe ioye and the wurship that eche of hem did to other, and so\nthey entred in to the town alle to-geder, and ther thei were met\nwith caroles and daunces, and with all maner of ioye.  And\nwhan they were come to the paleise, the kynge Arthur yaf grete\nyeftes to the meyne of the two kynges, after the astate and degre\nthat they of were: ffor he yaf horse and palfreyes, and robe and\narmures full feire and riche; and all this he dide by the\ncounseile of Merlyn.  And so was Arthur gretly preysed and moche\nbeloued a-monge grete and riche and pore, and in especiall of\nhem that neuer hadde hym seyn, but for the reporte that was of\nhym.  Gretly they merveled where he myght haue alle the\nrichesse that he ther yaf, so that with-Inne litill tyme, all that\nrepeyred a-bowte hym hadde so grete love to hym, that thei\nsworn thei wolde hym neuer faile. Than these lordes entred in to the Citee of Logres, be-gan the\ncaroles and the daunces of the ladies and damsels, and\nthe turnementes of yonge bachelers, that all the day dured till\nthe nyght, and the town was thourgh hanged with clothes of\nsilke, and it was feire wedir and clere, for it hadde not yet\nnothir reyned ne snowed ne frosen, but was as stille as a-boute\naust; and the stretes were strowed with small grasse, and incense\nand myrre in fires in the stretes thikke, and in the wyndowes many lightes, and so swote sauoured thourgh the Cytee that fer\nmen shulde fele the odour.  Thus come the lordes to-geder in to\nthe maister mynster, and where as the procession hem a-bode and\nreceyued hem fro fer with humble reuerence: that day songe the\narchebisshop masse, and whan it was ended they yede vp in to\nthe grete paleyse, where as the mete was arraide with all the\ncoriouse ordenaunce that myght be don, and the thre kynges\nwere sette to-geder at oon table, and the archebisshop, and Antor\nthat hadde norischid Arthur; and kay serued at tables as was\nreson; and two yonge knyghtes of grete prowesse, and were sones\nto two casteleins, that oon was cleped Lucas, the boteler, and\nthat other Gifflet, the sone of doo of Cardoell, which hadde be\nmaister forester to Vterpendragon, and thei serued with the\nstiwarde, and with Vlfin and Bretell, that wele cowde hem\nenforme so that thei were well serued and richely. After mete was the quyntayne reysed, and ther at bourded\nthe yonge bachelers, and after they be-gonne a\nturnemente, and departed hem in two partyes, and were well on eyther\nsyde vij C and CCC of the reme of Benoyk, that kepte hem to-geder\nin oon partye, and whan the turnemente was assembled redy to\nsmyte to-geder, the kynge ban and the kynge Boors, and her\nbrother that was a mervilouse clerke of Astronomye, noon in that\ntyme so expert saf Merlin.  These were lenynge out at\nwyndowes, and Arthur and the archebisshop with hem, and Antor,\nthat thei wolde not leve be-helden the turnement on bothe partees,\nand saugh the signes, and the stedes to neye and crye and to\npraunce vnder knyghtes and bacheleres, that the hilles and the\nmedowes resouned all a-bowte. And whan thei were so nygh assembled, than departed oute\nof the renge a knyght that was cleped Gifflet, the sone\nof do of Cardoell, that satte vpon a grey stede that merveilously\nwas swyfte, and on that other part com a-gein hym a knyght of\nbenoyk, that was cleped ladynas, and he was of grete renon, and\nhe sette a-gein Gifflet as faste as the stedes myght renne, theire\nshelde a-boute their nekkes, gripynge the speres, and thei smote\nto-geder in the sheldes so grete strokes that bothe brake theire speres, for bothe were they gode knyghtes and couetouse to gete\nworship; and they mette so to-geder with helmes and sheldes so\nfiersly, that they semede the yen fill from theire hedes, so eche bar\nother to the erthe, and theire horse a-bouen hem, and bothe lay\nlonge in sowowne that thei semed deed, and euery man seide that\nthey saugh neuer so crewell in-countre be-twene two\nknyghtes.  With that they renged hem on that oon part, and on that other\nfor the rescewe of the two knyghtes.  At the metynge of this\nturnement was sein many Iustinges, that gladly were be-holden,\nand some ther were that threw other to the erthe, and some\nthat brake theire shaftes with-oute fallynge to grounde.  Whan\nthe speres were broken, thei drough oute swerdes, and be-gan\nthe turney grete and huge; and ther was oon knyght that dide\nmany mastryes of armes with his body, of whom was moche\nspoken and preysed thourgh the Contree, and was cleped Lucas,\nthe boteler, and was cosin germain to Gifflet, that had the grete\nencourtir.  This Lucas smote down knyghtes and horse, and\nbe-gan soche dedis of armes, that noon myght his strokes\nendure.  He arached helmes fro hedes and sheldes fro nekkes, and be-gan\nto do so well, that it was merveile him to be-holde, and the thre\nkynges preysed him moche, and so dide many other.  Grete was\nthe turnement in the medowes by Logres, vpon the ryver of\nTemse, and longe it endured, that noon ne wiste who sholde\nhaue the better, for on bothe sides were many worthi men, and\nlonge it was er the two were releved that hadden the grete\nencountre.  And whan thei were horsed, thei smeten in to the\nturnemente, and tho gan Gifflet to do soche dedes of armes, that\nhe and Lucas, the botiller, that thei gate place vpon hem of\nBenoyk, and put hem fer bakke in the playn feilde; and than com\nhem to helpe the CCC knyghtes of Benoyk that yet ne hadde no\nstroke smyten, and on that othir syde come also CCC all fressh,\nand so eche ran to other.  There was grete stour and merveillouse\nand harde strokes smyten, and whan the speres were broken thei\nleyde honde to swerdes, and be-gan the chaple so stronge and\ndured longe tyme.  Ther men myght se many feire cheualries\ndon on bothe parties, for ther were many yonge bachelers that dide right wele; but, a-bove alle other, Gifflet, the sone of Do\nof Cardoell, and Lucas, the botiller, these tweyn were preised of\nprowesse a-boue alle other.  Whan the turnemente hadde longe\nindured and they were somdell wery for traueyle, than lept kay,\nthe stywarde, oute of his enbusshement, that yet hadde no stroke\nsmyten, he and other v felowes that were well horsed, and theire\nshildes a-boute her nekkes, theire launces in their hondes, and\nwhan thei aproched the renges, thei smote in a-monge hem as\nfaucouns amonge starlinges, and bar the firste that thei mette to\ngrounde; and whan theire speres were broke thei drough oute\nswerdes, and be-gonne to do soche maistryes and dedes of armes,\nthat kay hadde the prys and the wurship of the turnemente on\nthat oon part, and on that other part Gifflet and Lucas, the\nboteller; and the beste after hem, was Marke de la roche, and\nGuynas le Bleys, and drias de la foreste sauge, and Belyas, the\namerouse, of maydens castell, and Blyos de la casse, and Madyens\nle crespes, and Flaundryns le blanke, and Grassien, the castelein,\nand Placidas le gays: these dide so well whan thei come to the\nturnement, that noon myght agein hem endure; but after that\nthe felowes of the reame of benoyk dide so wele, that they made\nall the turnement resorte bak to theire firste place, for the\nfelisship of the table of Logres were gon oute for to chaunge helmes,\nthat weren to hewen and rente; and whan thei saugh theire\nparty turned to disconfiture, thei hem hasted and henten speres,\nand come in to the turnemente as faste the horse myght hem\nbere, and smote in a-monge the grettest presse, and kay cam\nbefore alle his felowes as he that was desirouse to shewe his\nknyght-hode, and griped a grete growen spere, and he was a\nmerveillouse gode knyght, yef he ne hadde not be so full of\nwordes, for his euell speche made hym to be hatid of a-monge his\nfelowes, and also of straungers that herden of hym speke, that\nafter refuseden to go in his felisshep to seche a-uentures in the\nreame of Logres, that after endured longe tyme, as this boke shall\nreherse here-afterwarde.  This tecche hadde kay take in his norice\nthat he dide of sowke, ffor he hadde it nothynge of norture of his\nmodere, ffor his moder was right a gode lady and wise and trewe; but of what kay seide, his felowes that knewe his costomes ne\nrought neuer, but he was full of myrthe and Iapes in his speche,\nfor seide it for noon euyll will of no man, and ther at lough thei\ngladly that knewe his maners, and on that othir syde he was oon\nof the beste felowes and myriest that myght be founde.  Whan\nhe was come to the turnement, as ye haue herde, he mette with\nLydonas, that wele hadde do all the day, and moche he and his\nfelowes peyned to dryve hem of Logres oute of the feilde, and so\nthei were nygh at disconfiture.  And whan kay saugh this he\nwas sory and wroth.  Than he smote in to the presse, and mette\nlydonas in the shelde so sore that he perced thourgh-oute, and\nthe spere poynte stynte oute at the haubrek, and he shof so\nharde, that he caste hym to the grounde vp-right; and with the\nsame course he smote Grascien, of Trebes, that he ouerthrewe\nhym and his horse.  Than he leyde honde to his swerde, and\ncride Clarence, the signe of kynge Arthur; and they be-heilde\nhym, and saugh the socour that he brought, for they wende they\nhadde all loste.  Than they returned, and be-gonne to do so well\nthat they hadde not do so well all the day be-fore. This Iustynge that Kay hadde don saugh well the kynge\nArthur, and the kynge ban and the kynge Boors, his\nbrother, and they preysed moche kay, and seide he was wight\nand deliuere, and thei be-heilde hym gladly.  And whan Lucas,\nthe botyller, saugh kay hadde don so well, he smote the horse\nthe spores in to the grettest presse, and smote Blios so harde that\nhe fill to the grounde, and the spere fly on peses.  Than he pulde\noute hys swerde and spronge in a-monge hem, and be-gan to yeve\ngrete strokes and to do so well, that moche he was preysed, and\nso be-gan the turnement newe to enforse for the rescewe of theire\nfelowes.  Than com Gifflet freschely armed, his spere in fewtre,\nas faste as his horse myght hym bere, and saugh Blioberes and\ntwo of hys felowes that leyde on kay, the stiwarde, with here\nswerdes, and heilde hym so shorte that he hadde grete nede of\nhelpe, for thei were thre and he was but alone, and also they\nwere thre the beste of all the turnement, and Placidas hadde hitte\nkay on the helme, that he lened on his sadill bowe; and whan Gifflet sye this he for-thought it sore, and he smote blioberis so\nharde, that he fill to the erthe, bothe he and his horse, and the\nspere fly on peces, and leide honde to his swerde, and smote\nPlacidas on the helme that he bowed ouer the arson of his sadell,\nand after leyde on hym so grete strokes, that he was so astooned\nthat he fill to the erthe vp-right, and kay hym dressed, that\ngrete nede hadde of that socoure, and after be-heilde and knew\nthat it was Gyfflet that so hadde hym delyuered, and thought to\nquyte hym that bountee yef he myght; and so he dide\nwithynne shorte tyme, as ye shall heren heir-after, and for that thei\nfelishiped first to-geder, and woued well to-geder longe tyme after\nof grete love alle the dayes of her lyf.  Whan Gifflet hadde delyuered kay, as ye haue herde, he loked a-boute hym and saugh\nIeroas, that moche hadde greved in that stour; than he griped\nhis swerde and ran vpon hym for ire, and yaf soche a stroke that\nthe fire fley oute, and ther-with he kytte a pece of his helme, and\nbut the swerde hadde swarved, he hadde ben deed for\neuer-more.  The stroke descended vpon the lifte sholder, that he fill to the\nerthe all blody.  Than arose the noyse and the crye, for well\nwende thei that this syen that he hadde be deed with-oute\nrecouer.  Than come his felowes to the rescowe, and on that other parte\ncom the felowes of kay, the stywarde.  Than be-gan the medle\ngrete and hidouse, that many were wounded and ouerthrowen er\nthat other was rescowed and sette on horse; and the fyve felowes\nthat were be-fore rehersed, whan thei saugh the medle so be-gonne,\nthei smot so v of the first that thei metten that thei blushit to\nthe erthe; than thei smyten in amonge hem, and be-gan to do so\nwell, that all hadde merveile how they myght it suffre or\nendure.  Ther be-gan a-gayn the turnement on bothe partyes, and well thei\ndide in armes on that oon part and that other, Till it drough\ntowarde evenesonge, that the thre kynges descended from the paleise\nand com in to the place where as was the turnement, and saugh\nthat thei heilde hem euen like, that noon ne wiste wele whiche\nhadde the better.  Than com the thre kynges, and hem departed\nand seide it was tyme to cesse, for it was to late eny more to\nturney, and so were they departed, and eche yede to his ostell to resten, for ther-to hadde thei nede and gret myster, for many\nwere they hurte; and the kynges yede to here euesonge, and than\nthei yede to soper, and after begonne the carolles and to speke\nof the turnemente, and asked oon of a-nother, how hem semed\nof whom that hadde don beste.  And thei seide that the kynge\nban hadde xv knyghtes that hadde don alther beste more than\neny other, and on that other part were viij that hadde don\nmerveiles in armes, and gretly hadde they traueylled and peyned,\nand moche were thei to a-lowe.  Thus heilde they here tales\nlonge, and alwey they yaf the loos and the pris to kay, the\nstiward, and to Lucas, the boteller, and to Gifflet, the sone of\ndo.  These were the thre that beste hadde don, and ofte tymes Iusted,\nand in euery nede were redy. Whan the tables were vp, arisen the thre kynges and the\nArchebisshop and Antor, and Guynebaus, that was\nbrother to the two kynges.  Than thei yede into a chamber that was\nbe-syde the halle, towarde the gardyn of the river of temse, and\nwith hem yede tweyne that ne ought not to be for-yeten, that\nwas Vlfin and Bretell, and so thei pleide and spake to-geder of\nmany thinges.  Than be-heilde Vlfin and Bretell, and than he\ngan to laugh, for he be-thought hym on the wordes that Merlin\nhadde hym tolde, whan they were gon on his message, how thei\nwere assailed in the deserte of vij knyghtes, and how they dide\nhem deliuere.  Than the kynge cleped hem bothe, and comaunded\nhem, be the feith that thei hym oughten, that thei sholde hym\ntelle all the trouthe, how thei hadde spedde in their\nmessage.  Whan thei herde the kynge thus speke, that oon loked on the\ntother and be-gonne to smyle, and Bretell ansuerde the kynge,\nthat thought well he it knewe thourgh Merlin, and seide, \"Sir,\nwherto sholde we telle you oure spede in oure Iourney, for as\nwele ye do it knowe as we oure self, thourgh hym that hath it\ntolde, and therfore it were but speche loste.\"  Than seide the\nkynge Ban, \"Who is that, that hath hym this tolde?\"  \"Certein,\nsir, the wisest man of the worlde.\"  \"And where is he?\" quod\nBan, \"and what is name?\"  \"Sir,\" quod Bretell, \"it is Merlin,\nand he resteth in my chamber here-ynne, and by his counseile hath my lorde sente after yow.\"  \"Sir,\" quod kynge Ban, \"lete\nhym come hider, for we haue moche disired hym for to see, for\nthe merveiles that we haue herde of hym spoken.\"  And Arthur\nseide that so wolde he do with gode will.  And than he sente\nVlfin for hym, and ther-with a-noon entred Merlin in to the\nchamber agein Vlfin, and seide, \"Returne,\" and so thei wente\nbe-fore the kynge, and and asked wherefore he hadde sente hym\nto seche.  And the kynge ban blissed hym for the merveile that\nhe hadde, how he myght knowe these thingis, and Merlin seide,\n\"Ther-of no forse, for here-after ye shull wite I-nough.\" Than he be-gan to telle a party of his lif, and than com forth\nGuynebaude, the clerke, and opposed hym of dyuerse\nthynges, for he was a profunde clerke.  And Merlyn hym\nansuerde to alle the questiouns that he asked the very trouthe as it\nwas, and so indured longe the disputacion be-twene hem tweyne;\nand at laste Merlin seide that all for nought he traueylede, \"for,\"\nquod he, \"the more thow sechest the more shalt thow fynde.\"\nAnd than seide Merlin to hem that were a-boute hym, that he\nhadde neuer founde no clerke that euer hadde spoke to hym of so\nhigh clergie, ne not blase, that was so holy a man, ne cowde not\nso moche enquere.  Wher-to sholde I make yow longe tale.  But\nlonge they spake to-geder, so that the toon was well a-queynted\nwith that other, and well thei loved to-geder.  And whan the\ndisputaciouns were don, Merlin com to the two kynges that were\nhis brethern, and seide, \"Lordynges, ye be worthi men and of\nhigh renoun, and also ye beth right feith-full and trewe; and lo!\nhere the kynge Arthur, that ought to be youre lorde, and of hym\nsholde ye holde youre londes and do hym homage; and he ought\nto helpe yow and to socoure agein alle men, yef ye haue nede.\"\nAnd thei seide, \"Merlin, now telle vs how he was chosen to be\nkynge, and wherfore, and yef Antor knowe whether he be the\nsone of Vterpendragon.\"  And Merlin seide, \"Ye, with-oute faile.\"\nThan he tolde hem alle the thinges like as was be-falle, so that\nthe archebisshop and Vlfin it recorded. \"Merlin,\" quod the kynge ban, \"we will that thow make\nvs sure of oon thinge that we shall aske, for so moche we knowe in yow, that ye will not to vs sey no lesynge for all\nthe londe that longeth to the crowne.\"  \"A ha,\" quod Merlin,\n\"ye desire to haue me sworn that it be trewe that I sey.\"  And\nthei be-gonne to laugh, and seide that ther uas noon so wise as\nwas he in no reame.  And Merlin seide, \"I graunte youre\nrequeste and youre desire,\" and so thei toke respite till on the\nmorn.  Thus ended theire parlament, and departed and yede to\nbedde, and the thre kynges and the archebisshop lay in oon\nchamber, for they wolde not departe on sondre.  And moche\nGuynebaude a-queynted hym with Merlin, that taught hym many\ngrete maistres and many feire pleyes; and Guynebaude well hem\nvndirstode, as he that was wise and a grete clerke, so that he\nwrought somme of the craftes ofte in the bloy Breteyne, that\nlonge tyme after endured, and as it shall here-after reherse.", "9": "CHAPTER X. THE BATTLE BETWEEN ARTHUR AND THE REBEL KINGS AT BREDIGAN. Whan these thre kynges weren a-bedde and at her ese that\nnyght, the storye seith that they lay till on the morn, that\nthei ronge to messe right erly, for it was a litill a-fore\nhalowmesse.  Than com Merlin and a-woke hem, and opened the two\nwindowes towarde the gardyn, for he wolde that hei hadde lyght\nther-ynne, and they hem clothed and a-rayed and yede to the\nmynster, and the archebisshop sange the messe; and than Merlin\ndide swere be-fore the kynges that Arthur was the sone of\nVterpendragon, and that he was be-geten on the quene Ygerne that\nnyght that the Duke was slayn, and that he was the moste\nrightfull heire that the londe myght holde.  After that swore Vlfin\nthat so god hym helpe and alle seyntes, that it was trewe all as\nMerlin hadde rehersed.  Whan the two kynges hadde take the\noth of these two, a-noon thei dide to kynge Arthur their homage\nfull debonerly as was right, and the kynge he receyved with gode\nherte and sympilliche with wepynge, and than thei kiste with gode herte for grete love, and than was the ioye more than\nbefore; and than thei yede vp in to the halle to mete, and thei\nwere served as high men ought to be, and after mete Arthur and\nMerlin wente to-geder to counseile, and the two kynges that were\nbrethern, and Vlfin and Bretell and kay the stywarde.  Thanne\nseide Merlyn, \"Feire lordynges, ye be alle worthy men and\ntrewe, and I knowe yow alle as wele or better than ye do\nyoureself; and lo! here youre lorde the kynge Arthur, \u00feat is right a\nworthi man, and a gode knyght shall he be of his honde; and ye\nknowe well that grete wronge that is do to hym by his barouns of\nhis londe, that will not resceyve hym for theire lorde, ne do to\nhym homage as thei ought to do of right, but besy hem to greve\nhym with all her power, and therfore I pray yow do as I shall\nyow counsell, and knowe it well that it shall be the beste\ncounseile that I may yow yeve.\" And they seide thei wolde do\nlike as he wolde devise, and he thanked debonerly.  And than\nhe seide, \"Lordinges, se here the kynge that hath no wif, and I\nknowe a mayden that is kynges doughtere and quenes, and of right\nhigh lynage, and also she is right feire, and of grete valoure, that\nno lady ne may haue more, and that is the doughter of kynge\nLeodegan, of Carmelide, that is now an olde man and hath no\nmo children but this doughter, whos name is Gonnore, to whom\nthe londe moste falle after his discesse; and he hath grete werre\na-gein the kynge Rion, that is of the lynage of Geauntes, and he\nis right riche and right puyssant, and yef it happe that he\nconquere the reame of Carmelide, that marcheth to the reame of\nLogres, that is Arthures, wite it well that Arthur ne shall not\nlonge kepe his londe in pees, and alle the dayes of his lif he shall\nhave werre on alle partees; and ne were the knyghtes of the\nrounde table, that deffende the reame of kynge Leodegan a-gein\nthe Geauntes, thei sholde haue all his londe wasted and distroied,\nand ther-fore I counseile yow that ye take with yow certain of\nyoure peple, and go with Arthur, and a-bide with the kynge\nLeodegan a yere or two, till that ye be with hym well a-queynted,\nand ye shull but litill while be ther, but he shall love yow better\nthan theym that with him now ther; and knowe it wele that he shall profer Arthur his doughter to be his wif, and ther-by shall\nhe haue his reame all quyte.  Ne neuer after that the Geauntes\nknowe, that he hath her wedded shull they not be so hardy to\na-byde in the contre, ne nygh it by a Iourney.\" Than ansuerde kynge Ban to Merlyn and seide, \"Dere frende,\nyef we go in to straunge londe, and leve our londes in\nthis manere as thei be, how shall ther-of falle, for we haue an\neuell and fell nyghbour that vpon vs werre, and brenneth oure\ntownes and castelles?  Ne this londe also is no-thynge sure, ffor\nthe barouns that sholde be the kynges frendes and his liege men,\nthei do vpon hym werren, therfore it is grete pereyle to leve his\nowne reame for to deffende a-nother mannes.\"  \"Ha, sir,\" quod\nMerlin, \"ye sey I-nough after youre in-tencion; but it is grete nede\na man to go bak to recouer the better his leep, for wite it well, for\na peny that ye less on this side, ye shall wynne tweyn on that\nside; ffor on this party shall ye neyther lese Castell ne Citee, and\non that other side ther shall ye wynne an hool reame, tha euer\nafter shall deffende this reame.\"  \"I wote neuer,\" quod kynge\nBan, \"what I shall sey, for ye beth more wyser than we alle,\nand a-gein me I will do that ye counseile, seth it is so as ye haue\nseide ther is no more, but lete vs gon, and therfore devise ye\nwhan we shull meve, and ther-to lete eche of vs make hym\nredy.\"  \"All be- tyme,\" seide Merlin, \"for ye ne shall not meve\nbefore lenton, for er that tyme moste ye do a grete bataile in this\ncontree agein the barouns, that assemble and gedere as moche\npeple as they may haue, and therfore we shull assemble as many\nas we may gete in the pryviest wise that we can, and lete hem be\nloigged in a launde that is in the forest of Bredigan, and ne doute\nnot ther-of but that ye shall do hem more damage than they shall\ndo to yow.\"  \"Merlin,\" seide the kynge Ban, \"yef I and my\nbrother sende for socour in to oure contree, may they come\nbetyme?\"  \"Ye, trewly,\" quod Merlin.  \"Than shall I sende\nthider?\" quod Ban.  \"Certes,\" quod Merlin, \"I shall go and\ndo that is ther-to nede, and sonner shall I be ther than eny\nmessager that ye can sende; but thei be-houe to haste, for the bataile\nshall be at Candilmesse, in the medowes of Bredigan, and therfore youre peple moste ryde nyght and day for to haste hem;\nand knowe it verily that I shall be at Gannes be to-morowe at\neuen.\"  And whan they herde that they merveiled gretly, and\nthan thei hym clipt and made grete ioye.  Than Merlyn cleped\nArthur, and seide, \"Sir, I go now on this message, for it is no\ntyme lenger to tarye.  Now, sende and assemble knyghtes, and\nseriauntes, and arblasters, as many as ye may gete, and ordeyne\nthat they be sente grete plente of vitaile in to the launde that I\nhaue nempned, that ye may departe a-monge the peple, for it\nshall be grete nede, and make eche man to take vitaile for xv\ndayes.  After that they be loigged, as mele and salteflyssh\nwithoute more; and the gouernours to departe hem shall be Lucas, the\nboteller, and Gifflet, and Vlfin, and Bretell; and ye, sir,\" quod\nhe to the kynge Ban, \"yeve me youre rynge, that I may it take\nto Leonces de paerne, youre cosin, be the token that he telle me\nthat I shall sey to yow.\" Whan the two brethern herde how Merlin spake they hadde\ngrete merveile, and were a-bassht, for thei wende that\nno creature lyvinge hadde knowen of that he seide; for he knewe\nalle thinges at oon worde as of soche thynges as hym liste to\nknowe, were thei neuer so prevy.  And thei seide, \"Seth it is so, we\nshall delyuer yow the rynge, and wite ye well that we love yow,\nand truste more than all the worlde.\"  \"Be my feith,\" quod\nMerlyn, \"ye sey as wise men at this worde, and thus moche\nshull ye wynne ther-by, that ye shall se oon day how moche that\nI do yow love.\"  With that the kynge toke hym the rynge, and\nMerlyn it toke and comaunded hem to god, and yede thider as I\nhaue yow tolde, and com be Blase, and tolde hym alle these\nthynges, that nought he lefte vn-seide; and also tolde hym how\nhe yede on message in to litill Bretein.  And he wrote in this\nboke that Merlin hym tolde, and by his writynge haue we yet\nthe knowinge ther-of.  With that departed Merlin fro blase,\nthat lenger ne wolde not tarie, but dide his message well and\nfeire, ffor on the morowe by pryme he come to Citee of Gannes, and tolde to Leonces that the two bretheren hym sente, and\nshewed hym the rynge that was the prevy token be-twene hym\nand the kynge, and Leonces a-noon yaf credence to all that Merlin\nseide.  Than a-noon he sente oute and purchased, and gedered so\nmoche peple, that thei were well x Ml , alle on horse bakke, armed,\nbe-fore the Citee of Benoyk, viij dayes be-fore yoole.  Than they\nsette kepers in the two Citees that were the two bretheren, soche as\nthei wiste was myster, and oon of the kepers was Lambeges, that\nwas right a trewe knyght, and a gode man of his body, and hym\nthei sette in the forteresse of Gannes, and Pharien, his vncle, praide\nhym to do well, and he seide so he wolde to his power.  And in\nthe forteresse of benoyk sette they Rahier de haut mur, that was\nright a gode knyght and yonge at pryme barbe; and in the\nforteresse of Trebes thei lefte Bawdewyn, the sone of Grassien,\nthat was the godsone of kynge Ban.  And ther-ynne were the two\nsusters lefte that were quenes, for that was the beste Castell, and\nthe strengest of bothe reames.  At Mouloir, a stronge castell of\nkynge Boors, thei lefte Placidas, that was a gode knyght and a\ntrewe.  Whan thei hadde thus garnysshed all the Contree, thei\ntoke their wey be nyght, for the moone shone clere.  And Merlin\ncondited the hoste oute fro euyll passages, and so thei traueyled\ntill thei come to the see and entred in to shippes.  On the tother\nside Arthur a-raied hym in the beste wise that he myght, as\nMerlyn hadde hym taught, for he sente and somowned, in the\npreviest wise he cowde, to alle tho that he knewe were his frendes,\nand so com grete plente of peple, more than he wende; and some\ncome thider with gode will for the grete yeftes that he yaf, and\nsome for to haue of hym a-queyntance for the grete bounte that\nthei hadde herde of hym speke.  And whan thei were assembled,\nthei were well x Ml on horsbak armed, for fotemen wolde thei noon\nlede.  And on the tother side come all the cariage of the londe,\nthat brought vitaile as Merlin hadde hem comaunded.  And the\nkynge made the hoste to be ledde, in the stillest wise that he myght,\nin to the launde of bredigan, for it was oon of the wildeste places\nof that oon knewe, ffor whan thei were ther loigged, thei were,\nas who seith, loste.  And the kynge dide oon thynge that Merlin hilde grete wisdome, ffor as soone as the cariage and vitaile was\nledde in to that place where thei were loigged, he sette in euery\nwey gode kepers thourgh the londe, that noon ne sholde passe\nthat ne were take and brought be-fore hym, for that he wolde\nnoon espye sholde entre in to his londe, for to discure to his\nenmys, and made defende oute thourgh his londe, that who ne\nheilde of the kynge Arthur ne ride not thourgh his londe be-fore\nthat Candelmasse were passed, and yef eny ther were that passed,\nhe dide hem to wite that he sholde other lese his lif or membre\nyef he myght be taken, ffor so hadde the kynge comaunded; and\nthei heilde hem so in pees that thei com not ther, and ther-of\nmerveiled the mene peple what it myght mene.  And thus was\nthe chyuachie so privily kept, that noon wiste where thei be\ncome, saf only thei of the kynges counseile.  But now stenteth\nthe tale of hem, and returneth to speke of the vij kynges that\nwere discounfited at Clarion, and all her companye, as ye haue\nherde. Now, seith the story, that sorowfull and full of hevynesse\nwere the vij kynges, whan thei were discounfited ther as\nthei loste all here harneyse of hirs and of her mayne.  Than thei\nswore and assured to-geder that neuer shulde thei be gladde till\nthei were avenged of kynge Arthur and vpon his enchauntour, by\nwhom thei hadde all that losse, yef thei in eny wise myght hym\ngete.  In this wise yede the vij kynges, mat and sorowfull for\nthire discounfiture wherefore thei sholde be the werse all hir lyf\ntyme, and somme of hem were caried in horse lyters that myght\nnot suffre to ryde, and so thei traueyled smale iournes, till thei\ncome in to theire londes, and soiourned till thei were hool of her\nwoundes.  And at the monthes ende thei toke a parlement in a\ncontre that is be-twene the reame of Gorre and Scotlonde, and\nthe parlement was this: that eche of hem sholde sende after all\nhis kyn and frendes, and so go vpon the kynge Arthur and be-reve\nhym his londe, and so exile hym fro all the contree; and so thei\nsette day to assemble at Bredigan, in the medowes.  Thus thei\ndeparted, and sente for helpe bothe fer and nygh; and com hem\nto helpe the Duke Escam, of Cambenyk, with v Ml men of armes, and also come the kynge Tramelmens, of Northwales, with vj Ml men, and the kynge Clarion with iij Ml men, and the kynge with\nthe hundred knyghtes, that was a noble knyght and an hardy,\ncome with iij Ml men, and also com the kynge Loth, of Orcanye,\nand Leonoys, with vij Ml men, and the kynge Carados, of Strangore,\ncom with vij Ml men, and also the kynge Ventres, of Garlot, com\nwith vij Ml men, and the kynge Vrien, of Gorre, com with vij Ml Men, and also come the kynge Ydiers, of Cornewaile, with vj Ml men; and so thei rode forth smale iournes, as thei that wende\nwell to distroye the contree.  Than thei sente their espyes\nthourghoute the londe, for to knowe the rule of kynge Arthur; but the\nkepers that were sette in the contrey a-noon token hem alle, and\nsente hem to kynge Arthur, and were sette in prison that thei\ncowde heir tydynges.  And these kynges spedde forth her iourney\ntill thei mette, and were logged vnder the Castell of bredigan,\nand were mery and gladde, for thei wende well that they hadde\nall wonne.  Thei sente theire forrears through the contrey, but\nlitill thei fonde to take, ffor all was ledde in to Castelles and\nstronge townes, and this was do be the counseile of kynge ban\nand the kynge Broos, his brother, that were full wise\nknyghtes.  And whan thei saugh that all was gon, and that the peple of the\ncontrei hadde this don, thei sette all on fier and on flame, and\ndistroied the londe all that thei myght, and made vitaile be\nbrought to the oste of her owne londes; and when thei were\nalle to-geder thei were acompted lx Ml .  But now cesseth the tale\nto speke of hem, and speketh of Merlin, and of the socour that\nhe bringeth oute of the litill Breteyne, as ye haue herde be-fore. Now, seith the boke, that so Merlin, and Leonces, and Pharien,\nand Antoynes, the stiwarde of Benoyk, com to the rochell,\nand entred in to the shippes, and so thei sailed till thei com to\nthe bloy bretaigne, and it is reson that the boke do yow to\nvndirstonde whi it is so cleped.  This is the trouthe: after that the\ndistruxion of troye, it fill so that two barouns departed and\nfledde the contrey, and oute of the londe, for doute of the\nGrekes.  Of these two barouns that fledde the londe come grete plente of\npeple; and the name of that oon was Brutus, whiche dide a-ryve in this contrey, and dide do make a Citee, that in his lyve was cleped\nthe newe troye, for that he was come oute of troye, and the londe\nwas cleped in worship of his name Bretaigne, for that his name\nwas Brutus; and longe tyme after the dethe of this Brutus com\na-nothir kynge in to this londe, that hight Logryns.  This Logryn\na-mended gretly the Citee, and made towres and stronge walles\nenbateiled, and whan he hadde thus amended it he chaunged the\nname and cleped it Logres, in breteigne, for that his name was\nLogryn, and this name dured in to the deth of kynge Arthur; but\nafter his deth, and the deth of his barouns, that thourgh Mordred\nand Agrauayn eche slow other on the playn of Salisberi, as\nthe boke shall reherse her-after, the deth of launcelot, that was\nthe sone of kynge Ban, of benoyk.  And so it fill after that ther\nwas a grete pestelence and slaughter of barouns and of the mene\npeple, and for that the losse was so grete, the mene peple cleped\nit the bloy bretaigne, ffor that her hertes and her thoughtes were\nso bloy and so blake for theire frendes, that thei hade so loste for\nmyschaunce of synne. Now haue ye herde the cause why this londe was cleped the\nbloy bretaigne.  The tother baron that fledde oute of\ntroye was cleped Corneus.  This Corneus was of the lynage of\nGeauntes, and in that contree that marched to bretaigne, and he\nwas right a mervilouse knyght, and was moche and stronge, and\nmade townes and Castelles, and men cleped the contrey\nCornewaile in bretaigne, ne neuer after yet this name ne lefte.  And\nof hym come the Geauntes, as seith the frenshe book, that\nmoche harme haue don to the bretouns, wherof this book shall\nreherse yow here-after, and also of the merveiles that be-fill in\ntheir tyme.  But now returneth the tale to Merlin, that cometh\nin the see, and with hym bryngeth the socour and helpe to kynge\nArthur oute of the litill breteigne. Now seith the boke that whan Merlin and his companye\nwere arived in the grete breteigne, Merlin comaunded\nthat all the harneise and armoure sholde be trussed in males and\ncloth sakkes, and in other cariage, ffor he wolde not that they\nsholde not loigge ne tarye on the wey, but that thei sholde trauaile day and nyght till thei come in to the place where\nMerlin wolde hem loigge with the meyne of kynge\nArthur.  And thei dide his comaundement.  And so thei spedde her\niourneyes that the fifte day thei come in to the forest of\nbredigan, where thei fonde the hoste of kynge Arthur.  And\nbothe hostes made to-geder ioye, as soone as eyder of hem\nmyght sen other.  Than thei loigged in tentes and pavilouns,\nand restede hem so viij dayes hool, and than was the vitaile\ndeparted as Merlin hadde devised.  And than come Merlin to the wardeyns of the hoste, and seide, \"I go to fecche the thre\nkynges, for thei shull do beste at this nede than eny other.\"\nAnd thei seide to Merlin in game, \"Loke ye be-war of the tother\nparti, for we here sey that thei do manace yow sore.\"  \"I knowe\nthat well,\" quod Merlin, \"but thei shall neuer haue ouer me no\npower; and I do yow to wete that thei haue reson to hate me,\nfor thei haue no werse enmy, ne noon that may do hem so grete\ndamage as I shall do, as longe as thei be enmyes to the kynge\nArthur.  But I haue it not yet be-gonne; but be well ware that\nnoon isse oute of this hoste, ffor than the harme myght neuer be\nrestored, ffor alle Arthurs enmyes ben loigged here faste by,\nvndir the castell of bredigan.  And thei be acompted xl Ml wele\nhorsed men.  And of oure party we be but xxv Ml , and therefore\nwe moste be wisely gouerned, or elles we sholde alle lese.\" \"Sir,\" quod Vlfin, \"another ought rather to go on this\nmassage than ye.\"  \"Nay,\" quod Merlin, \"I can\nbetter lede hem in safte than eny other, so that thei shall not be\nseyn ne knowe of no man.\"  \"Now goth, a godes name,\" seide\nthe barouns, \"and as hastely as ye may come to vs a-geyn.\"  And\nMerlin departed a-noon fro hem so sodenly, that thei knewe not\nwhere he was be-come.  And than thei blissid hem for the grete\nmerveyle that thei hadde ther-of.  And than thei departed, and\nyede a-boute in the hoste and sette soche gouernaunce that noon\nwas so hardy to meve ne to sette a fote oute of the hoste, ne of\nher loiggynge.  And thus thei a-bode iiij dayes that thei ne herde no tydinges of the thre kynges ne of Merlin.  And, as the boke\nseith, the same nyght that Merlin departed fro the hoste, he come\nto logres be-fore euesonge, where as he fonde the thre kynges full\npensif and hevy, for the contrey that was so wastid and\ndistroyed.  Than come Merlin so sodenly a-monge hem that thei wiste not\nfro whens he com.  And a-noon thei hym clipt and made grete\nioye, and after thei asked hym how he hadde spedde seth that he\nfro hem departed; and he seide right wele, and badde hem make\nredy to go in to the oste, ffor ther-after the barouns dide a-bide. \"How, sir,\" quod kynge ban, \"is oure socour than I-come.\"\n\"Ye,\" quod Merlin, \"thei be loigged by Arthurs\noste in the myddel of the launde, in the foreste of bredigan; and\nthei be xv Ml horse-men, and also of Arthurs x Ml .  But on that\nother party is moche peple, for ther be x kynges crowned and a\nDuke, and thei haue in theire companye l Ml horsemen.\"  \"Now\ngod helpe vs,\" quod Arthur, \"for this a grete peple.\"  \"Ye,\"\nquod Merlin, \"yet is ther more with this myschef than all this,\nffor thei be gode knyghtes and of high prowesse; but be the\nfeith that I owe to kynge Arthur, that is my lorde, I hope, with\nthe helpe of god to do so moche thourgh the witte that he\nhath me sente, that in euyll tyme come thei ther, for thei shall\nhaue so moche to done that thei shall not a-gein yow endure.  But\nther shall be a bateile, and that shall be grete, and moche slaughter\nther shall be of men and horse; but on owre partye shull not be\ndeed above xxiiij, but on their syde shall be deed the thowsandes,\nand that shall ye se.  And therfore a-noon aray yow, for after\nsoper we will ride.  And also do lede with yow vitaile for iiij\ndayes, for it is not to a-bide lenger.\"  And whan that thei\nvndirstode that Merlin hadde seide, a-noon thei made redy and\naraide hem of alle thynges that was nedefull, and than yede to\nsoper at gode leyser.  And than the kynge asked Merlin yef\nthei sholde hem arme.  And he seide, \"Nay,\" for it sholde do\nhem to moche gref, ne thei sholde haue no drede of no man\nlyvinge be that wey as he wolde hem lede. Whan thei hadde souped thei cloded hem warme as thei\nmyght, for the froste was grete, and the mone shone clere; and they passed on her iourney.  And ne were no mo\nthan xxv Ml what oon and other.  Whan thei were alle on horse\nbakke, Merlin rode be-fore, and the thre kynges and Antor, that\nsatte vpon a grete stede, whiche the kynge made hym on to\nryde, to be with hem in company; but he wolde haue abiden\nwith gode chere yef the kynge wolde.  In this maner thei rode\nall nyght; and Merlin was Guyde till thei com in a grete\nforeste, where thei a-lighte till here mete was made redy.  Than\nthei ete and dronke of soche as thei hadde brought with hem, for\nthei hadde I-nough.  And whan thei hadden ete, Merlin yede to the thre kynges in counseile, and seide, \"Sir,\" quod he to\nkynge Arthur, \"wote ye what I shall sey:  ye be a yonge man,\nand haue a grete reame to maynteyne, and the barouns ne deyne\nnot to yow obbeye; and also the mene peple ne knowe yow but\nlitill ne were the great yeftes that ye have yoven.  And,\nther-fore, I say yef euer ye haue be large of yeftes here be-fore, loke\nnow that ye be larger hens-forth, ffor ye may not so wele gete\nthe hertes of youre peple as for to be fre and gentill in yevinge;\nand ye shull haue I-nough whereof, and I will telle yow how.\" \"I do yow to wite that in this grounde, ther we be now, is\nthe grettest tresour that may be founde in eny place;\nbut ye shall not take it till ye be repeired fro the bateile, for ye\nshall haue I-nough of other thinges to departe.  And, loke ye,\ntake gode hede of this plotte of grounde that ye now sitte on,\nwhan that ye be agein repeired.\"  Than he shewde hem a welle,\nand made ther a signe.  And the kynges were gretly\na-merveiled of that he hadde seide.  And whan thei hadde longe\nspoke togeder thei lepe to horse, and rode day and nyght till\nthei come in to the hoste, in the foreste of bredigan.  And ther\nthei pight the kynges teynte, by the feirest welle and the moste\nclere that thei hadde seen.  And it yaf so gret foyson of water\nthat the brooke ran down the launde, that was right feire and delectable .  And the weder was right colde, for, as the boke\nseith, it was in the moneth of Janever, viij dayes before Candelmesse.  And whan thei were loiged thei rested, and right her\narmours, and soiourned so two dayes hool.  Than com Merlin to hem, and seide that \"Now fro hens-forth may we go vpon\nyoure enmyes, and ther-fore devise now who shall haue the\nvaunt garde, ffor ye shull go in soche manere that thei shall not\nknowe till ye be vpon hem, and that shall be two oures be-fore\nday erly; ffor and thei a-perceyve yow thei be so moche peple\nthat ye may not agein hem endure.  And haue ye no drede, for\nye shall haue the victorye.\"  Than thei hem armed, and a-raide\nin the beste manere, and devised her batailes, and deliuered to\nkay the kynges banere, for to bere, that condited the firste\nbateile.  And with him was Gifflet and Lucas the boteller, and marke de\nla roche, and Aguyuas li blois, and drias de la forest sauage,\nand belias the amerouse, and flaundrins le bret.  These viij\nknyghtes were in the firste sheltron, and were iiij Ml horsemen;\nthe secunde ledde Bretell, that was of grete bounte and a trewe\nknyght, and a sure of his honde, and he hadde iij Ml wele\nhorsed.  The thirde he delyuered to Vlfin, that moche knewe of werre,\nand was a full noble knyght.  In this warde was kynge\nArthur, and iiij Ml of gode men that neuer wolde faile their lorde\nfor no drede of deth, and eueriche of these wardes drough by\nhym self a-sonder like as was devised.  And so rode forth a softe\npas kepynge clos, as Merlin dide hem guyde, whiche rode before\nvpon a grete courser.  After that the kynge Ban devised and\nordeyned his peple and his brothers, and delyuered the firste warde\nto Pharien for to lede, and also to bere the ensigne of kynge\nBoors, as he that was a noble knyght and wele a-vised, and with\nhym was Moret de la veye, and ladunas, and Pales de trebes, and\ngrassiens li bloys, and blioberis and meliadus the blake, and in\nher company iij Ml horsmen.  The seconde warde of kynge\nban ledde leonce of Paerne, that was a noble knyght and an\nhardy, and in his company iiij Ml wele arayed.  The thirde warde\nlede the kynge Boors of Gannes, that full wele cowde hem\nguyde, and were in his company iiij Ml men wele horsed.  The\nforthe bataile ledde the kynge Ban of Benoyk, whiche was the\nbeste kyght of alle other that was in the hoste.  And he delyuered his signe to Aliaume his stiwarde for to bere, that was\na gode knyght, and in his company iiij Ml of gode men, that\nfor no fer of deth wolde not faile their lorde.  And whan they\nwere all a-raide and discevered a-sonder, thei rode forth be the\nmone light that was full bright shynynge.  Now cesseth the\ntale to speke of hem at this tyme, and returne to telle of the\nDanes, and of the kynges that marcheden to the londe a-boute,\nthat become to werre vpon the kynge Arthur. Now, seith the boke, that whan the kynge Brangore and the\nkynge Margans, and the kynge hardogabran, that was\nnevewe to the kynge Amynadus, that was kynge of the Danes,\nthat was oncle to Aungier, the danoys that Arthurs fader dide\nslee like as ye haue herde here fore whan thei herde sey how\nthese vij barouns dide werre vpon kynge Arthur.  Than thei\ndide somown her peple fer and nygh, till thei were xxx ti M l of\nmen on horse bakke with-oute fotemen wherof was grete plente,\nand so thei entred in to the londe, and toke many prayes and\nbrent townes and vilages and distroyed all the contrees as thei\npasseden, and slow peple grete plete, and sette a sege be-fore a\ncastell that was called Vandelers, in cornewaile, and ther thei\nwere longe tyme, that neuer ne myght be put oute, for all the\npower that the xj kynges hadden, till that the kynge Arthur\nchased hem oute after that his barouns were acorded with\nhym.  But now of hem no more speketh the boke at this tyme till the\nmater it asketh, but repaireth to kynge Arthur and to Merlin,\nand to kynge Ban, of Benoyk, and kynge boors, of Gannes, and\ntelleth how thei were in-batailed a-gein the xj kynges that were\nbe-fore the castell of bredigan. The boke seith that while kynge Arthur and kynge Ban, of\nbenoyk, and kynge Boors, of Gannes, ordeyned her batailes\nin this wise, as ye haue herde; that nyght the xj kynges ne\ntoke noon hede to sette no wacche in thayr hoste, but wente to\ntheir bedde, and slepte as thei that no-thynge knewe that her\nenmyes were so nygh, but oon feire fortune for thei hadde, that\nalle the xj kynges lay in the kynges teynte, that was cleped Roy\nde Cent Chiualiers, and thei ne wende not to haue no drede of no man; and as thei thus were slepynge be-fill that kynge looth\nwas in a ferfull dreme, ffor hym semed that he saugh so grete a\nwynde a-rise that it caste down howses and stepelis of chirches,\nand after that ther come a thounder so grete and merveilously\nsharpe, that hym thought all the worlde trembled for fere and\ndrede, and after that com a water so sharply, that drof down the\nhowsynge and a grete parte of the peple, and hym semed how\nhym self was in grete pereile to drowne; and as the kynge loth\nwas in this affray, he dede a-wake, and hym blissed and was sore\na-baisshed of this dreme that he was in, and a-roos and a-pareiled\nhym, and yede to his felowes, and hem dide a-wake and tolde\nhem his a vision.  And thei asked hym fro whiche part com the\nwater, and he seide from the foreste com all the rage and the\ntempeste as hym semed.  And thei seide thei knewe verily that\nthei sholde hastely haue bataile, and that merveillouse.  And\nther-with thei a-risen, and a-woke alle the knyghtes ther-ynne,\nand comaunded hem to serche all the contre environ, that thei\nwere not supprised of no peple.  And thei armed hem right\nwele, and lepte on ther horses, and rode serchynge the\ncontrey.  And the xj kynges hem armed and a-raide in the beste maner\nthat thei cowden.  And than Merlin be-gan to haste Arthurs\npeple, that well knewe the gouernaunce of the tother party, and\nthei com so faste on, that thei toke noon hede till thei were euen\nfallen on hem that the contrey serched.  And whan thei saugh\nhem armed, thei hadde grete drede, and asked Merlin, that mette\nwith hem formeste, what peple thei were, and Merlin seide it\nwas the kynge Arthur that was come to chalange his londe a-gein\nalle hem that ther-with wolde be greved.  Whan thei herde\nthese wordes thei turned bakke, and smote the horse with spores,\nand whan thei come in to the hoste, thei cryde \"Treson,\ntreson.  Now as armes lordes, gentill knyghtes, for ther was neuer so\ngrete nede, for lo! here cometh Arthur euen at youre teyntes.\"\nAnd thei ronne to here armes, that yet were in her beddys, and\nhadde no leyser hem to clothe, and that was yet a faire happe\nfor hem that her horses were redy sadellyd; but yet for all that\nthei myght hem hasten, thise other were vpon hem er thei myght be half a-raied of her harneyse.  And ther-with hem fill a grete\nencomberaunce, that Merlin sente hem soche a wynde and tempeste,\nthat her tentes fill vpon their hedes, and a-monge hem was soche\na truble that vn-ethe myght eny of hem se other ne heren.  And\nthat was a thynge that gretly hem distrubled in her armynge, and\nther-ynne thei caught grete damage, ffor Arthurs peple smote in\na-monge hem, and ouerthrewe and slowgh all that thei myght\na-reche.  But the xj kynges were departed and deseuered, and\nyeden oute in to the playn feldes with-oute the tentes, and made\nblowe a trompe high and clere.  And that was don for that all\ntheire men sholde drawe towarde hem.  And thei dide so as many\nas myght aschape fro hem that of hem hadde no pyte, ffor ther\nwas of hem so many slayn in that grete myschef, that of the\nthirde parte thei were well delyuered, and ther-to thei saugh\nhem of so grete puyssaunce, that thei turned to flight towarde\nher baner where as thei herde the trompe sowne, ffor the kynges\nwere stynted at the entre of the forest by a river, and ther\nassembled alle her peple that thei myght haue.  And so thei encresed\nlitill and litill, till thei were xx ti M l that fledde, some heere and\nsome there, that ne myght come to here baner but with harde\npeyne.  And so were thei sory and wroth for theire grete damage\nand losse, and sore thei compleyned their grete annoye.  And\nx Ml lefte liggynge in the felde what dede and wounded, that no\npower hadde hem to diffende ne for to greve noon other. Whan the kynge Arthur saugh that all the herbegage was\nto hym be-lefte, than he com to Merlin, and asked hym\nhow he sholde do.  Quod Merlin, \"I will telle yow what ye\nshall do.  Ye shall go here be-fore to the passage at the forde,\nwhere as be gadered xx ti M l men, and ye shall fight with hem\nand make hem entende to yow.  And the kynge ban and his\nbrother shull go a-bowte, and come on the tothir syde of hem,\nand com on hem fro the foreste.  And thei shull so be astoneed\nthat in hem shall be but litill defence.\"  Than thei departed the\ntoon fro the tother.  And the kynge yede thedir as the barouns\nwere a-bidynge that ne wende to haue no drede of noon other,\nsaf of hym; and of hym thei ne drede but litill, for thei trowed hem wele to diffende agein gretter peple than ther was with\nhym.  And the kynge Ban torned towarde the foreste, and\nArthur rode with his company till he com ther as the xj kynges\nwere to-geder assembled.  Whan thei come to the passage of\nthe forde ther sholde ye haue seyn speres perce thourgh sheldes,\nand many knyghtes liggynge in the water, so that the water was\nall reade of blode.  And kay heilde so the pas with the baner,\nand payned that his company gate ouer.  And whan the xj\nkynges saugh so small a peple, hem thourgh preced and rused,\nfor thei were but iiij Ml , and thei were more than xx ti M l , thei\nhadde ther-of grete despite and shame, and diffended hem\napperly.  And kay and his feliship kepte hem so clos that\nnoon ne myght hem persch, but longe thei myght it not suffre;\nbut than com Vlfyn hem to socour, that gretly hem conforted,\nand passed the water delyuerly.  And whan thei were ouer thei\nsmyten in a-monge hem so vigorously that oon myght here the\ncrassinge of speres half a myle longe.  Grete and crewell was\nthe bateile at this assemble, and the noyse grete and huge vpon\nthe helmes and sheldes.  And many a noble man lay ther deed\nand wounded, wher-of was grete damage.  But longe thei myght\nnot this endure; but than com Bretell, and hem sustened, and\nmoche he hem comforted.  And as soone as bretell was passed\nthe water he saugh hys company at grete myschef, for he saugh\nVlfin drowen down of his horse in the presse, that heilde his\nswerde in his honde and strongly hym deffended, that noon was\nso hardy his strokes to a-bide.  And whan bretell that perceyved\nhe was sorowfull and pensif, for he hym loved full\nhertely.  He let his horse renne, and smote him so sore that he first mett\nthat he threwe hym and his horse to the erthe.  And whan\nClarion saugh that he hadde grete sorow at his herte, and seide\nthat he wolde his felowe a-venge yef he in eny wyse\ncowde.  And whan bretell saugh kynge Clorion come, he sette his horse\nhym a-geyn, and mette so sore to-geder that the sheldes perced,\nfor bothe the knyghtes were stronge and of grete pris and grete\nmaltalente, so that her speres splyndered in peces, and that\ntheir passage hurtlid so to-geder with their bodyes and sheldes and helmes, that her yen sparkeled that thei semed thei were\nfallen from their heedes so were thei astoned.  And the horses\nbar hem so harde that the skyn of the horse knees and legges\nwere all to rente, that the blode ran to the erthe.  Longe tyme\nlay the barouns at erthe with-oute remevynge, so astonyed that\nthei ne wiste whethir it was nyght or day; so thei that it\nbehelden wende eche hadde slayn other.  Thider preced bothe\npartyes to the rescowe, and ther was grete losse on bothe\nparties.  Than com kay the stiward to the rescowe, and on the\ntother side come thre kynges.  Ther sholde ye haue sein fres\nencountre, for on Arthurs side was viij, and on the tothir side\nwere xj; and thei smeten to-geder fiersly.  Ther was Gifflet\nvn-horsed, and lucas the botiller, and the kynge brangore, and\nthe kinge Ydiers, and the kynge Vrien, and the kynge\naguysas.  Ther be-gan the medle grete and merveillouse, and longe it\nendured, for thei remounted Gifflet be fyn force a-monge his\nenmyes, and that made kay the stiwarde, for he sette Gifflet on\nthe kynge Ventres horse; and also he smote down the kynge\nloot with a tronchown of a spere that he was sore hurte.  And\nwith that stroke com the kynge cleped the roy de Cent\nchyualers, and hadde in his compayne lx knyghtes of the beste chosen\noute.  And whan he saugh kay the stiwarde hadde smyte down\nthe kynge loot, hit hym for thought sore, and seide, \"But I hym\na-venge I am litill to preyse!\"  He spored his horse that wey\nand hitte kay so sore that he bar hym vp-right to the erthe, and\nledde his horse to kynge loot, and seide, \"Sir, haue heer and\nthenke to a-venge youre annoye, for moche haue we loste this\nday.\"  And the kynge loot lepte vp lightly.  And whan Gifflet\nsaugh kay fallen, and also lucas the botiller, he was sorowfull\nand hevy, and hadde recouered a stronge spere, and spored the\nhorse, and smote a knyght of the kynge de Cent chyualers that\nhe bar hym to grounde vp-right, and than hente the horse be\nthe reynes, and presented it to kay; and he lepte vp lightly as\nhe that hadde grete mystere.  And the kynge de cent chiualers\nand kynge loot haue so medled that by fyn strengthe thei haue\nhorsed the kynge Ventres of Garlot vpon the horse of moret de la roche, and the kynge ydiers vpon the horse of Guyuas le bloy,\nand the Duke Escam of Cambanyk vpon the horse of drias de la\nforest sauage.  And whan these lordes were horsed, thei seide\nthei wolde be a-venged vpon the losse that thei hadde received, or\nelles thei wolde be deed. Than these viij barouns yaf a newe a-saute, but ther was grete\nlosse of men and horse, whan that Arthur com that gretly\nhem comforted and hem sustenyd, for as soone as he was passed\nthe forde, he smote the horse with spores, and fonde Vlfyn on\nfote, and his swerde in his hande, and bretell, that with grete\npeyne lepte on horse, wherfore Arthur was sore greved.  He\nheilde a grete square spere and smote in to the presse where he\nsaugh thikkest, and mette with Tradilyuaunt, the kynge of\nwales, that com a-gein hym all fressh, and he hym hitte so harde,\nthat he smote hym thourgh the shelde, that he yaf hym a wounde\nin the lifte syde, and hym threwe to the erthe so rudely, that he\nhym all to brosed, and Arthur hente the horse by the gilte reynes\nand yaf it to Vlfyn, and bad hym lepe vp delyuerly vpon that\nstede and thenke to a-venge the shame and the vilony that ye\nhaue hadde.  And so he dide lightly, and seide, \"Sir, gramercy.\"\nAnd a-noon as Vlfyn was vp he smote in to the presse, and leide\non so harde that he brake the presse, he and kynge and her\nhelpes that newe were come oute of her enbusshement.  And thei\non the tother side were wroth for the grete damage that thei\nhadde, and yet were thei more peple be the haluendell than\nhadde Arthur.  Than be-gan the medle right stour, and grete\nand mortall, wherefore many a fre moder wepte salt teeres.  Ther\ndide kynge Arthur many merveiles in armes, that by his dedis\nhe was knowe in shorte tyme of many oon that neuer hadde hym\nsein, and they yaf hym place alle the moste hardy of hem, for\nthey ne durste not of hym a-byde a stroke. Whan the kynge, that was called le roy de Cent Chiualers,\nsaugh the kynge Tradelyuanunt reuerse to the erthe he\nwas right wroth, for he hym loved with grete love, and he was\nmerveilously wele horsed, and he rode fiercely to kynge Arthur,\nand smote hym so sore vpon the helme that he was astonyed. And whan the kynge felte the stroke, hym for thought it sore,\nand so dide kay that was in his company.  The kynge cam\nformest grypynge his swerd for to smyte hym thourgh the\nhelme.  And whan he saugh the stroke come, he coured hym with his\nshelde, and the kynge hym smote so harde, that the haluendell\nfley in to the felde; and the stroke glenched vpon the horse hede,\nand smote it of be the eres.  And so thei fill to grounde, the\nhorse and his maister.  And kay be-heilde and saugh an horse go\na-stray, and he caught it and yaf it to Antor.  And he lepte vp\nlightly, and after caught a spere, and smote margnam, the\nstiwarde of the kynge cleped roy de Cent chiualers, so harde\nthourgh the shelde and the lifte shulder, that the spere hede\nshewed thourgh, and he fill to the grounde vp-right, and\nther-with brake the spere.  And he leyde honde on the horse, and\nledde it to Bretell be the reyne, that ther-of hadde grete\nnede.  And he lepte up delyuerly, and than he be-heilde a-boute in the\npresse, and saugh lucas the botiller lye a-monge the horse feet\nfull doelfully.  And Gifflet a-bode by hym, and deffended hym\nright vigerousely, and moche hym preysed and comended, for\nther was a-geyn hym xiiij, and he but sool by hym-self; and yet\nmyght thei not gete on hym no grounde for powert hat thei\nhadden.  And whan bretell saugh this he com thider, and smote\nthe first that he mette so harde thourgh the helme that he slyt\nhym to the teth, and after he smote the seconde on the arme,\nthat he made it fle in to the felde with all the shelde; and than\nthe thirthe so harde vpon the lifte shulder that he it deseuered\nfrom the body.  Whan Gifflet saugh he hadde socour, he smote\noon so harde on the temple that he slyt it to the nekke; and he\nfill down deed.  And Gifflet toke the horse, and ledde it to\nlucas the boteller.  And he lept vp angry and wroth, as he that\nwolde fayne a-venge his shame.  And than he hente a spere\ngrete and sharpe grounde, and saugh Aguysans, the kynge of\nScotlonde, and rode a-gein hym full egerly, and smote hym with\nall his myght thourgh the coler of his haubrek so sore that he\nfill to the erthe.  And whan Mares saugh hym so delyuered he\nlepte vpon the horse delyuerly, and rode in to the bataile, that not dide but enforce more and more, and fonde belias and\nflaundryns, that were arested vpon diras, and on dionas tweyne\nof her felowes, and peyned hem for to remounte hem on her\nhorse; but so grete was the presse that thei hadde no leyser hem\nto be-holde.  And so thei foughten so strongely that it was\nmerveile to be-holde.  And thei smyten in monge hem, and\nbe-gonne to do so wele, that the two felowes were agein sette on\nhorse.  And on the tother side faugh the kynge Arthur and his\nmeyne so longe and the noyse and the cry aros of the two\nkynges that thei hadde vn-horsed.  And so thei ronne to the\nrescowe on bothe sides, that oon for to socour, and the tother to\nhelpe the kynge Arthur.  Ther was the medle grete.  Ther\neche wounde and kylde other; but with grete payne were the\ntwo kynges rescued and sette on horse.  But first was ther grete\noccision, for the kynge Arthur kepte hem so shorte that thei myght\nnot hem socour for power that thei hadden; and ne hadde be on\na-uenture that fill thei sholde neuer haue be rafte from Arthur,\nfor he ran the rescow of kay and Gifflet, that kynge Ventres,\nand kynge brangores, and kynge Vrien, and the kynge Abigans,\nhadde ouer-throwen from theire horse, and hem defouled vnder\nthe horse feet full lothly, and hadde no mo hem to deffende but\nlucas the botiller, that these all so moche greved.  Whan the\nkynge Arthur saugh this nede, he turned that wey as wroth as a\nlyon, and leide a-boute hym on bothe sides, and slow all that he\nraught with a full stroke, so that thei voyded hys strokes and\nhym rome.  And kay and Gifflet pressed to the kynges, that\nmoche hem hadde greved, and with hem sore foughten.  And on\nthe tother side faught bretell and Vlfyn and Antor with the duke\nEscam of Cambenyk, and a-geyn Tradilyuaunt, and a-gein clarion,\nof Northumberlonde, and agein Carados, that was a noble knyght;\nso thei made hem to blenche thider, as kynge Arthur faught,\nthat dide merveilouse prowesse of werre.  Ther thei stynte that\noon agein the tother, for ther was the maister baner, and ne\nhadde be the kynge Arthur hym-self.  Alle thei hadden be\ndiscounfited, for these kynges were odde noble knyghtes, and\nmore peple be the toon half than on Arthurs syde; and, therfore, it myght not longe endure with-oute grete damage.  Than\ncom vpon hem the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors from\nthe foreste, where thei wende to haue no drede of no man\nlyvinge.  And whan thei were come an thei hem sye, thei\nyaf ascry that all the foreste and the river resounde; and\nthei saugh well that the losse and the damage moste nede falle\nvpon hem.  Thanne the princes and the barouns drowen a-part\nto-geder in the medowes, and devised a-monge hem self what\nthinge that thei myght do.  Than seide the kynge loot, \"I wote\nneuer how ye be a-vised to do, but as for me I shall vpon iij or\niiij of hem ben a-vengid of myn annoye, sith that all shall be\nloste.  And whan the kynge cleped Roy de Cent chiualers\nvndirstode how kynge loot hadde seide, he preisede hym moche,\nand seide that in the same maner wolde he do; and so dide\nkynge Carados, and the Duke Escam seide the same, and the\nkynge Clarion of Northumbirlonde seide also in the selue\nmaner.  \"Now than,\" quod kynge loot, \"I shall telle yow what we\nshull do.  Lete vij of us go a-gein hem that come fressh oute of\nher enbusshment from the foreste, and fight with hem while we\nmay endure; and the tother v abide here in this bataile.  And\nwe shall go a-gein hem with xij Ml men, and viij Ml shull a-bide in\nthis stour; and we shull holde this bataile nygh this wode, vpon\nthe river, vn-to the nyght, in soche manere that they may not vs\nenclose; and than may we beste departe, for yef we now do fle,\nwe shull lese more than to a-bide stille.\"  To this counseile that\nkynge loot hadde yove a-corded wele all the prynces; and drough\nhem a-parte, and disseuerede her peple.  And the kynge loot,\nand the kynge de Cent Chiualers, and the Duke escam of\nCambenyk.  And the kynge Aguysans of Scotlonde toke xij Ml in her\ncompanye, and made vj wardes, and in euerich of hem ij Ml men.  And so thei rode forth the softe pas straite and clos till they come\nto the straite be-twene the wode and the river, as the kynge loot\nhadde hem taught; and that was the beste counseile that any\nman myght hem yeve.  Thus thei were redy hem to deffende;\nand the tother v lefte in the bataile that full vigorously hem\ndeffended a-gein the kynge Arthur.  Of these v that a-bide stille was the kynge Brangore, that oon, and the kynge\nVrien, and the kynge Ventres, and the kynge Clarion,\nof Northumbirlond, and Tradilyuaunt, the kynge of North\nwales, and hadde in her company vij Ml men, and heilde her\nenbuschement in a litill grove, and ther thei hem diffended right\nsore, as thei that were full noble knyghtes and of grete renoun;\nand grete doel and pite was it for the euyll will be-twene hem\nand the kynge Arthur.  And here was sore bataile, and endured\ntill it was even toward nyght.  And on the tother side come the\nkynge Ban and the kynge boors, and leonce and Pharien, that\nledde the firste bataile, and come clos a softe pas, and full longe\nhem thought er thei were mette to-geder.  And on the tother\nparte com a-gein hem the kynge ydiers.  And when thei aproched\nnygh thei lete renne and smyte to-geder so harde that ye myght\nhere the strokes half a myle of length.  Ther was a merveillouse\nstoure and harde bataile, and grete occision of men and of horse,\nbut thei myght not suffre longe, ne endure the peple of kynge\nydiers, but were driven bak vpon the warde of kynge Aguysans\nof Scotlonde, that gretly hem counforted and sustened.  Here\nbe-gan the bataile merveilouse and harde.  And the peple of\nPharien were sore ouerleide; but as leonces of Paerne com hem to\nsocoure, and a-sailed hem so fiercely, that noon ne abode in the\nplace, but drof hem bak vpon the warde of the Duke escam of\nCambenyk.  Whan the Duke saugh hem come, he cride his\nensigne, and lete renne to theym that he sye comynge, and smote\nin amonge hem fiercely.  Than recouered thei that fledden, and\nreturned a-gein to hem that hadde hem enchased.  And ther thei\nstalleden and foughten the ton vpon the tother till thei were\nbothe wery for travaile.  And so longe endured the fight\nbetwene hem that her strokes ne peysed but light.  Than com on\nthe kynge Boors with the grete baner, wher-of the feilde was\nynde, bende of golde.  And whan the kynge ydiers saugh hym\ncomynge, he seide, \"Ha! now god vs deffende fro deth this day\nand fro mayme, ffor now I se well that we be alle in pereile of\ndeth, for I se yonder comynge the baner of the man that most is\ndredde of his enmyes thourgh the worlde.  And ther-to he is so gode a knyght that alle other be but as hares as in comparison to\nhym, saf only his brother, to whom no comperison may be made.\" Whan the kynge that was cleped Roy de Cent chiualers\nvndirstode the wordes of kynge Ydiers, he asked what\nhe was.  And he ansuerde, \"It is the kynge Boors of Gannes;\nand I ne wote how, ne whan, he com in to this contre; but, lo,\nhym yonder, for I knowe well his baner.\"  Than seide the kynge of the Cent cheualers, \"How com he in to this londe?\"  \"So\nhelpe me god,\" quod kynge loot, \"I wote neuer; but now it shall\nbe knowe who is knyght.\"  Than seide the kynge Carados,\n\"I wote not what eche of yow will do; but as for me, I will go\nhym a-geyns, and yef I haue nede of socour and helpe, so do ye\nyoure dever.\"  And thei seide so thei wolde, and be-taught hym\nto god that from euell hym sholde diffende.  Than departed\nCarados from these other, and rode clos a softe pase a-gein the\nkynge Boors.  And whan thei approched to-geder nygh a bowe\ndraught, thei lete bothe her horse renne the ton a-gein the tother\nas faste as horse myght hem bere, and brake their speris in her\nmetynge.  And many ther were that were throwen to grownde,\nand many wounded to the deth, and many ther were that\npasseden thourgh and come with-oute stroke of spere, and after\ndrough theire swerdes and be-gonne stronge bataile, and harde\nand merveilouse.  Than com the kynge Boors to a knyght that\nwas his godsone, and his name was Blaaris, and comaunded hym\nto bere his baner.  And he was a merveilouse gode knyght, and\ndurste not refuse it.  And the kynge Boors seide he wolde assay\nhow the bretouns cowde bere armes.  Than he hente a grete\nspere, and rode in a-monge hem that alle the renges fremysshed,\nand smote a knyght so sore that ther was noon armoure myght\nhym warante, but that he sente the heede and the shafte\nthourgh the body and threw hym to grounde so rudely that in\nthe fall he brake his nekke, and the spere fley on peces; and\nthan he pulled oute his swerde, and be-gan to do so merveilouse\nof armes that alle thoo it syen were sore a-basshed, and made hym\nwey and fly from his strokes as soone as thei saugh hym come\ntowarde hem.  And ther hadde the kynge Carados loste to moche; but as the kynge de Cent chiualers hym socoured\nanoon with ij Ml men, whiche was a worthi knyght and desirouse\nin armes.  And as soone as thei were mette thei heilde hem\nperyngall; but the prowesse of kynge boors was passynge alle\nother, for he dide merveiles.  And on the tother side dide well\nthe kynge Carados, and the kynge de Cent Chiualers; these\nsuffred many myscheves.  And thus thei endured longe tyme. Than com the kynge Ban of Benoyk, that thought it was\nlonge tyme till he were mette with his enmyes.  The\nkynge com in to the stour with hys baner in his honde, and it\ndelyuered to his stiwarde.  Crownes of goolde and asure bendes\nentrauerse lysted as grene as a mede, and the stremers down to\nthe handes of Antony his stiwarde, and also he spredde ouer the\neres of his horse and the nekke.  And whan the barouns saugh\nthe baner of kynge Ban, thei wyste well that with-ynne short\ntyme thei moste voyde the feilde, or elles dye yef thei longe\na-bide.  And a-noon as thei were assembled thei on the tother\npart ne heilde no place.  Than the kynge loot com and\nassembled his company, wepinge with his yen, for he saugh wele that\nall was loste on his party.  Thanne sholde ye haue seye\nbrekynge of speres on bothe sides vpon sheldes, and the erthe to\ntremble vnder the stedes, and the wode to resounde of the grete\nstrokes that ther was yove to-geder, that men myght haue herde\nit half a myle longe.  And whan the kynge Ban was come the\ntother party ne a-bode not longe, but were dryven bakke that\nthei were made to resorte to the fyve kynges and vpon her\npeple.  Here was full grete dolour and grete mortalite of men\nand of horses, for as soone as the kynge Ban com in to the\nmedlee he be-gan to do so grete martirdom of peple, and so grete\noccision, that on alle partyes thei fledde from his swerde.  And\nhe serched the renges thourgh, and his swerde in his honde, and\nleide on bothe sydes that ther nas noon so thikke presse but he\nit disseuered full moche; and gretly was the kynge Ban and his\ncompany I-douted.  Than com the kynge loot and the kynge de Cent chiualers and margamour, alle thre; and the bateilles were\nentermedled that oon with the tother.  And whan thei saugh\nthe kynge Ban, that dide hem so moche damage, loot was right\nwroth, and so were the tother kynges.  Than he smote the horse\nwith the spores that wey, his swerde in his honde; and he was a\nnoble knyght and an hardy, and smote the kynge Ban vpon the\nshelde a grete stroke, that a cantell fleygh in to the\nfeilde.  And whan Ban saugh this it a-noyed hym sore; and than he lifte\nvp the bronde, and ficched hym in the styropes so harde that the\nIren bente, and wende to smyte the kynge de Cent Chiualers\nvpon the helme, and he that douted, and the stroke blenched,\nand smote the steede with the spores, and the stroke descended\nbe-hynde, and smote a-sonder the trappure of mayle, and thourgh\nthe horse to the erthe; and so thei frussht bothe on an hepe, the\nhorse and his maister.  And whan the kynge was fallen he lepe\nvp delyuerly on fote, his swerde in his honde, and his shelde\ncoverynge hys side.  When the kynge Brangore saugh the\nkynge de Cent chiualers falle, he ran vpon the kynge Ban, and\nsmote hym so grete a stroke thourgh the shelde that he slit\na-wey a grete quarter.  And the kynge ban hym yaf so grete a\nstroke thourgh the helme that he slyt the sercle and the koyf of\nIren to the heed, and yef the swerde hadde not glenched he\nhadde be deed.  And he fill to grounde astonyd.  Whan the two\nkynges were releved thei be-gonne the medle a-gein the kynge\nBan; but he hym deffended so wele that thei hadde more\ndamage than he; ne ther nas noon of the two kynges but thei\nhadde loste a grete part of her blode, for the woundes that thei\nhadde resceyved.  And it a-bode not longe er ther come grete\ndamage and losse to the thre kynges, whan the batailes were\nmedled to-geder, and he made hem departe wheder thei wolde or\nnoon.  Than fill it that the kynge Arthur fonde the kynge ban\non fote, in myddell of the presse, his swerde in his fiste, that\nhym deffended so vigerously that noon ne durst hym\na-proche.  And he was a moche knyght, and a stronge oute of\nmesure.  And he lepe vpon hem thourgh the presse; and whan he\nneyghed ner thei made hym wey, for so thei douted his strokes that ther was noon so hardy that durst hem a-byde.  Ther-with\ncom the kynge Arthur, brekynge the presse, gripynge his\nswerde, all be-soyled with blode of men and of horse, for he dide\nmany merveiles of armes with his body.  And whan he saugh\nthe kynge Ban at so grete myschef, he wax wode for Ire.  Than\nhe rode to a knyght that richely horsed; and Arthur lifte vp the\nswerde, and smote hym thourgh the helme soche a stroke that he\nslyt hym to the teth, and he fill to grounde.  Than he toke\nthe horse be the reynes, and ledde it to kynge ban, and seide,\n\"Frende, lepe on lightly, for in euell tyme ben oure enmyes\nentred; anoon shall ye se hem for-sake the felde.\" Whan the kynge ban was horsed be the helpe of kynge\nArthur, he was gladde of that hadde hym\nfounden.  And than thei two smyten in a-monge her enmyes.  And whan\nthe tother perceyved the grete damage that the kynge arthur\nand the kynge ban hem dide her peple, that were so loste and\ndiscounfited, and that thei hadde loste all talent of wele doynge,\nand turned the bakkes.  And thei hem chased to the wode; but\nther were many slayn and defouled.  So were thei distreyned\nbe-twene the wode and the river.  Ther thei stalled and a-bode,\nand knewe well yef thei hadde be in the playn thei hadde be in\npereyle of deth.  Than the kynge loot, and the kynge ventres,\nand the kynge de C. chiualers, and the kynge Carados, and the\nkynge vrien and the kynge ydiers, and the kynge brangore, and\nthe kynge of Northumbirlonde, helde hem to-geder; whan\nmarganors hem seide, and badde hem suffre and a-bide, while thei\nmyght for to socour theire peple; for yef thei be thus disconfite,\noure peple shull be all loste and distroied. Thus chased hem the kynge Arthur and the kynge ban\nbe-fore alle other, till thei come to a grete water and a\ndepe, where as thei that fledde hadde made a brigge of tymber\nand of plankes.  And thei passed over the water after the\ntother, and so enchased hem the kynge Arthur and the kynge\nBoors, that thei come to that brigge that was so made, and wolde\npasse ouer after hem.  And than com Merlin and seide, \"Kynge\nArthur, what wilt thow do?  haste thow ouercome thyn enmyes? Go in to thi londe, and lede with the thy frendes that thow haste\nbrought with the, and hem serue and worschipe at theire pleiser,\nffor I moste go in to the wode for to my distynes aboute blase,\nthat right moche is my frende.\"  Anoon he departed from Arthur,\nand entred in to the forest, and fonde blase, that longe after hym\nhadde desired.  And than he asked hym where he hadde so\nlonge a-biden.  And Merlin tolde hym how he hadde be a-boute\nthe kynge Arthur for to counseile hym.  And blase seide he dide\nbut foly to a-bide so moche a-bowte hym, saf only for to counseile\nthe crowne royall.  Than Merlyn tolde hym alle thynges that\nwere falle to the kynge Arthur seth he departed fro hym, and\nhow he yede for to fecche socour in the litill breteyne.  And\nthan he tolde hym how the hethen peple were entred in to the\nlondes of the barouns, and how thei werred.  And blase wrote\nalle these thinges that Merlin hym tolde, and sette hem in his\nboke; and ther-by haue we the knowleche ther-of.  But now\nleueth the tale to speke of Merlyn and of blase, and speketh of\nkynge Arthur and of the twey other kynges that ben in his\ncompany.", "10": "CHAPTER XI. THE DOINGS OF KING ARTHUR AFTER THE BATTLE, AND HIS DEPARTURE FOR TAMELIDE. Now seith the boke whan that kynge Arthur hadde discounfited\nhys enmyes, and the xj kynges and a Duke, by the\ncounseile of Merlin, that was gon to blase his maister in\nNorthumberlonde.  Than he returned gladde and ioyfull of that oure lorde\nhath yove hym the victorye of his enmyes.  Than he com to \u00fee\nlogges wherof the walles layn at the erthe as Merlin hadde beten\nhem down.  Than thei leged and pight teyntes and pavilouns,\nand hem rested, and lete the hoste be wacched.  And leonce and\nPharien hadde the gouernaunce of the wacche, and Gifflet and\nlucas the botiller.  Pharien and leonces kepte towarde the wode,\nand Gifflet and lucas towarde the medowes, and alle the tother lay and rested hem till day, and than thei ete and dranke grete\nplente, for thei hadde I-nough of vitaile.  In this manere rested\nthe hoste till in the morowe, till the kynge Arthur made be\nleide on an hepe all the wynynge and the richesse that ther was\ngeten.  And whan thei hadde herde messe thei com a-gein ther\nas the tresour was leide to-geder.  And the thre kynges it departed\na-boute to soche as hem semed was for to do, to on lesse and to\na-nother more, after that the persones were of astate or\ndegre.  And so thei departed to pore knyghtes and squeres that neuer\nafter were pore, in so moche that thei kepte not to hem-self the\nvalew of a peny.  And after thei departed stedes and palfreyes and\nclothes of silke, and yaf all while ther was ought to departe, and\nsente a-gein alle knyghtes and squyres and sergeauntes and other\nmeyne, saf xl that sholde go with hem in to Carmelide.  Thus\nyede Pharien and grassien and leonces, lorde of Paerne, and\nledde with hem her peple for to kepe her londe and her contrey,\nthat the kynge Claudas ne dede hem no stade. Whan these barouns were come in-to theire contrey thei\nboughten londes and rentes wher-with thei leved after\nin grete honour with the auer that was departed that made hem\nafter riche.  And the kynge Arthur lefte in his contrey the\ntwo kynges with hym, as ye haue herde.  So thei soiourned at\nbredigan that was in the marche of breteyne the grete, and in\nthe marche of Carmelide; and ther thei a-bode Merlin that sholde\ncome to hem thider.  And on the morow, whan Arthur sholde\ndeparte his peple, and that he hadde made hem grete feste and\ngrete ioye at bredigan, and the kynges hadde dyned, they yed vp\nin to the loges that were vpon the ryver for to se the medowes\nand the gardynes.  And as thei be-helden, they saugh come a\ngrete karl thourgh the medowes by the ryver with a bowe in his\nhonde, and his arowes vnder his girdell.  And in the brooke were\nwylde gees, that hem dide bathe as theire kynde is to do.  The\nkarll drough his bowe, and with a bolte smote oon in the nekke,\nthat it brake in sondre.  Than he shette a-nothir bolte, and\nslowgh a malarde.  Than he toke hem, and henge hem be the\nnekkes at his girdell, and yede towarde the loges where as the thre kynges were lenynge, and hadde well seen the shotte of the\nkarll.  And whan he come nygh the loges he shette a-nother\nbolte, and whowped to the kynge Arthur.  And whan the karll\ncom nere, the kynge asked yef he wolde selle the briddes.  And\nthe cherll seyde, \"Ye, with gode will.\"  Quod the kynge,\n\"How wilt thow yeve hem?\"  And he ansuerde no worde.  And\nthe cherll hadde on grete boysteis shone of netes leder, and was\nclothed in cote and hoode of rosset, and he was girde with a\nthonge of blakke shepes skyn; and he was grete and longe, and\nblakke and rowe rympled.  The cherll also semed to be crewell\nand fell, and seide to the kynge, \"I ne knowe nought of the\nkynge that loueth tresoure, and is regrater and a wyssher, that\ndar not make a pore man riche that myght hym do gode\nseruyse.\"  Quod the cherll, \"I yeve yow these briddes, and yet haue I no\nmore than ye se; and ye haue not the herte for to yeve the thirde\nparte of youre gode that in the erthe doth rote er ye haue it\nvp-taken, and that is nether youre profite ne worship.\"  Whan these\nkynges herde the wordes of the karll thei be-heelde the oon the\ntother, and than thei seiden, \"What deuell who hath tolde this\ncherll?\"  Than the kynge ban cleped the karll, and asked hym what\nhe seide; and the karll ne ansuerde no worde, but bad the kynge\nArthur to do take the briddes, and than he wolde gon hys\nweye.  \"Now, by thy faith,\" quod kynge ban, \"telle me who hath\ntolde the that the kynge Arthur hath tresour in the\nerthe.\"  Quod the cherll, \"A wylde man tolde me, that is cleped Merlin,\nand also he tolde me that he sholde this day come to yow for to\nspeke with yow.\"  In the tyme that thei spake thus to-geder,\ncome Vlfin oute of a chamber, and come thider as the kynge\nspake to Merlin, \"Go forth thy wey,\" quod the kynge, \"how\nmay I the trowe that thow haste spoke with Merlin?\"  Quod\nhe, \"Yef ye will leve me, and yef ye ne will, leve me nought;\nfor I ne leve yow nought, and so be we quyte.\"  And whan the\ncherll hadde seide thus, and after Vlfin a while hadde listened,\nand than he be-gan to smyle, and wiste wele it was Merlin. And whan Merlin saugh Vlfin, he seide, \"Sir stiwarde, take\nthese briddes, and do dight hem for youre kynges soper, that\nhath not the hardynesse to make a man riche that myght hym\nwell guerdon, and to hym that this day hath spoke with the\nman that hath hym tolde of the grete richesse vnther \u00fee\nerthe.\" Than be-gan Vlfin to lawgh right harde, and seide, \"Sir, yef it\nplese yow come with me here a-bove, for I wolde speke with\nyow of many thynges.\"  And he seide he wolde go with gode\nwill.  And the kynge be-heilde Vlfin, and saugh hym laugh\nhertely, and than he required hym to telle why he dide laugh so\nsore.  And he seide that he sholde wyte a-nother tyme.  Than\nyede the cherll so araide as he was, and mette with kay the\nstiward, and seide, \"Holde here, sir seneschall, now may ye\nplume, and as gladly mote the kynge hem ete as I it hym\nyeve.\"  \"Sir,\" quod Vlfin, \"and this is not the firste tyme.\"  With\nthat com bretell, and hadde wele herde that Merlin hadde seide,\nand also that Vlfin hadde seyde to hym, that better semed a\ncherll than eny that was in the worlde.  And whan he hadde\nherde hem a-while speke, he perceyved that it was Merlin, and\nbe-gan to lawgh vndir his mantell right harde.  And the kynge\nherde hym, and badde hym telle the cause why that he\nlowgh.  And he tolde he wolde telle hym yef the carll wolde\nassente.  And the cherll than be-gan to laugh lowde, and seide to Vlfyn,\n\"Tell on, for I will that thow do so.\"  Than seide Vlfin to the\nkynge, \"Sir, ne knowe ye not youre frende Merlin, and ne\nsholde not he come to speke with yow to day.\"  And the kynge\nseide, \"Yesse; wherefore say ye?\"  \"Sir,\" quod Vlfin, \"I sey\nfor that ye knowe hym not so wele as I wolde that ye dide; ffor\nye se somme two tymes or thre, and yet ye ne knowe hem not, and\nther-of I merveyle.\"  Whan the kynge vndirstode Vlfyn he was\ngretly dismayed, that he wiste not what for to ansuere.  \"Certes,\"\nquod Vlfin, \"ye haue seyn hym many tymes, and that I knowe\nwell.\"  Than seide the kynge, \"Telle me what is this\ncherll.\"  \"Sir,\" quod Vlfin, \"sholde ye ought knowe Merlin yef ye\nmyght hym se?\"  \"Yee, trewly,\" seide the kynge, \"right\nwele.\"  \"Thanne be-holde this worthi man, and loke yef ye haue euer hym seyn.\"  And the kynge hym be-helde, and seide that he\nhadde hym neuer seyn be-forn.  \"Trewly,\" quod Vlfin, \"he\nmay sey that euell hath he be-sette his servise on yow: for it is\nMerlin, that so moche hath don for yow, and loved so moche and\nholpen of all that he myght do or sey agein alle tho that vpon\nyow do werre.\"  And whan the kynge Arthur vndirstode this\nhe blissed hym for merveile.  And also the two kynges were\nsore a-merveiled, and seide, \"How may this be, merlin; is\nit thus? neuer dide we se yow in soche habite.\"  And he seide\nthat myght well be so.  \"Sirs,\" seide Vlfin, \"dismaye yow\nnot, for he shall shewe yow the same semblaunce that ye saugh\nhym in firste.\"  And thei seide that thei wolde that fayn\nse.  \"Now,\" quod Vlfin, com with me in to this chamber, for I wolde\nspeke with yow.\"  And thei com in.  And than seide Vlfin,\n\"Sirs, ne merveile nought of Merlins dedes, for he shall shewe\nyow semblaunces I-nowe; and at alle tymes whan he will he\nchaungeth hym by forse of his art, where-of he is full. And\nGynebans, the clerk, it witnesseth wele; and wyte ye well that\nye shall hym se yet many tymes, that ye shull not knowe that it\nis he; and for that he chaungeth hym so ofte he is dowted of\nmany a man, for ther is many oon in this londe that full gladly\nwolde se hym deed.  Now lete vs go in this chamber, and ye\nshull se hym in the same semblance that ye saugh hym firste,\nwhan he a-queynted hym with yow.\"  And whan thei come\na-gein they fonde Merlin in the halle in the same semblaunce that\nthei hadde seyn hym in firste.  Than thei ronne to hym, and\nenbraced hym, and made hym grete ioye as thei that hym loved\nwith gode herte.  Than thei satte and Iaped, and pleyde with\nhym alle to-geder; and of the shetynge that thei hadde seyn,\nand of the wordes that he hadde seide to the kynge.  And than\nseide Arthur, \"Merlin, now I knowe that ye love me, whan\nwith so gode chere that ye have yove me these fowles, and that\nI sholde ete hem for youre love.\"  And Merlin be-gan to\nlaugh.  Thus thei a-bode in ioye and solace till the lenton.  And so it fill thay by the love of Merlin Arthur a-queynted hym with a mayden,\nthe feyrest that myght be founden.  This mayden was cleped\nLysanor, and was doughter to the Eirll Sevain that was deed, and\nwas heyr of the castell of Campercorentyn.  This maide was\ncome to do homage to the kynge Arthur, and with here other\nbarouns that dide homage as soone as he hadde conquerid these\nxj kynges, ffor thei douted that he sholde be-reve hem of her\nlondes, and also thei thought that thei myght no better lorde\nhaue than hym; and some ther were that come with gode\nwill, and some for drede of more losse.  And this mayden that\nwas feire com to Bredigan, where-as the kynge soiourned, and\nwas at hoste with a riche burgeys.  And so be the helpe of\nMerlin he spake with her previly, and lay with her a nyght,\nand that nyght upon her was be-geten hoot, that after was\na full noble knyght, and was also a felowe of the rounde\ntable.  This hoot was of right high prowesse, as ye shull heren\nhereafter.  And at mydlenten the kynge toke leve of the damsell,\nand he and the other two kynges toke their wey in to Tamelide,\nhym-self the fowrtithe.

THE RETURN OF THE ELEVEN KINGS TO THEIR CITIES, AND THEIR ENCOUNTER WITH THE SAXONS. Now seith the story that full of sorowe and hevynesse were the\nbarouns of theire disconfiture and losse, and riden forth\nplaynynge and regretinge theire grete damage; ne thei ne ete ne\ndronke of all that nyght, and no more ne hadde thei don of all\nthe day be-fore, for the bataile hadde endured all the day; and\nit was full colde weder and grete froste, and therfore thei were\nat more disese for hunger and for grete colde.  Than thei com\nto a Citee that was cleped Sorhant, and was a town of the kynge\nVriens.  And a nevew of he kynges resceyved them with grete ioye, and his name was cleped Bandemagu.  Ther thei rested and\nesed hem in the town as thei that ther-to hadde grete nede, ffor\nmany of hem were hurt and wounded that a-bode stille till thei\nwere heled.  But thei were not ther thre dayes, whan the\nmessagers of Cornewaile and of Orcanye com to hem and tolde hem\nthe losse and the distruxion of the Sarazins that dide thourgh\nther londes, and were at a sege before the castell Vandeberes, and\nhadde filde the londe full of here peple, and seide how thei\nsholde neuer be remeved ne driven oute of the londe.  And whan\nthe lordes herde these tidynges ther ne was noon of hem but\ntheir fleishe trymbled for this auenture that was hem be-fallen,\nfor well thei knewe that thei were distroyed; and than thei\nwepte full tenderly. Upon a day the kynge Brangore, that was a wise man, sente\nhis messages to alle the kynges, and praied hem to come\nspeke with hym.  And thei come in to Vriens grete halle; and\nwhan thei hadde herde what the kynge hadde seide, thei drough\nhem alle a-part to-geder, as thei that her iyen were all reade and\nfor swelen for wepynge, so that vn-nethe myght thei se oon\na-nother.  And whan thei were alle to-geder thei were alle stille\nand mewet as though thei hadde be dombe.  And whan the\nkynge Clarion of Northumberlonde saugh thei seide no worde he\naros vpon his feet, and seide to the kynge Brangore, \"Sir, I am\ncome hider to here what ye will sey, for yester even ye sente for\nvs, and I am now come; now may ye sey youre pleiseir, and I\nwill go my wey, for I have now no nede to pley ne Iape; and\nafter may ye speke to these barouns of youre nede.  And I sey it\nfor this, that I heere no worde in hem spoken.\"  And the kynge\nBrangore seide, \"I shall telle yow the cause why I sente for yow,\nlordinges.\"  Quod he, \"we have herde the trouthe that the\nsasnes of the kyn of Aungier, of Saxoyne, be entred in to oure\nlondes and in to oure heritages, and haue grete part of oure londe\ndistroied and brente, and haue be-seged the Castell of\nVandesberes, in the marche of Cornewaile; and therfore ye moste sette\nhasty counseile how we shull spede that thei were driven oute of\nthe londe, or elles be we deed and disherited, we and oure heyres for euermore.  Ye knowe well that we heue loste in this\nchyuachie that we have made vpon the kynge Arthur.  Ne of\nhym ne of his londe gete we no socour; and on this side of the\nkynge Leodegan of Tamelide, that gladly wolde vs helpe and\nsocour yef he hadde power; but the kynge Rion, that is so\nmyghty and riche, vpon hym werreth, and hath do this two\nyere.

Ne of the kynge Alain, his brother, that lith\nin sekenesse, and shall neuer be warisshed till the beste knyght\nof alle Bretouns come and aske hym why he hath that maladye,\nand what thinge sholde be hys helpe.  And of the kynge of Sorloys\nne may we haue no socour, ffor Galehaut, the sone of the Geaunte,\nof the oute yles, werreth vpon hym, and will that that holde his\nlonde of hym, and he hym diffendeth as he may.  Ne of the\nkynge Berennain ne may we haue no socour; ne of the kynge\nAnadonain, ne of the kynge Clamadas, for alle these werreth;\nand Calchous, that is cosin to the kynge de Cent chiualers, that\nnow for vs hath traueyled\u2014god quyte it hym!

Thus\ncan we no counseile but god of his mercy vs helpe and rede;\nand while we be now to-geder, lete vs ordeyne what is beste to\ndo, for it is nede.  And yef it be so that we discorde, than be we\nvtterly distroyed, for well ye knowe that we haue loste grete\nauoir, where-with we myght wele haue mayntened oure werres\na-gein the saxoyns.  And witeth it wele that this damage haue\nwe be the counseile of Merlin, that wente to fecche the kynge\nban of Benoyk and the kynge boors his brother, in the litill\nBreteyne, that ben the beste knyghtes of the worlde.  And he hath\ndo hem to make homage to kynge Arthur; and witeth it wele also\nthat as longe as Merlin is in contrey a-gein vs we shull not a-gein\nhym endure, ffor noon ne is so wise ne so puyssant that may of\nhym be-ware, ffor he knoweth alle thynges that be to come, and also that is do and seide; and therfore I sey wepinge, ne\nmakynge of sorowe, ne may vs not a-vaile; but wemen shull\nwepe.  And lete vs take hede to saue the peple and the londe fro\nthese vn-trewe and misbelevynge sarazins that thus sodenly be\nentred vpon vs.  Therfore, for the reuerence of oure lorde, lete\nvs haue pite of the people and the londe and on oure self.\"  And\nther-with he satte down and was longe tyme er eny baroun seide\neny mo wordes. Than a-ros the kynge Tradilyuaunt, of North Wales, and\nseide as he that was a full wise man and wele I-lerned,\n\"The beste counseile that I se is that we go stuffe the marches\non this partye ther the saxouns comen, and lete make all the\nchyuachie, that we may assemble of all the chyualrie that we\nmay, and lete kepe the passages, that ther come to hem no more\nsocour ne vitaile than thei haue now; and in the meene while\nlete vs geder oure kyn and oure frendes and sowderes out of alle\nlondes, and lete vs yeve hem bateile as soone as we may be\nassembled, for other-wise I can not se how thei may be remeved fro\nthe sege.\"  Whan the lordes vndirstode this that the kynge\nTradelyuaunt hadde seide, thei preised hym moche, and seide it\nwas the beste counseile that myght be sette, and ther-to thei\na-corded alle to do as he hadde seide.  Than thei asked that whiche\nmarches thei sholde garnyssh, and with what peple; and soche was\ntheire counseile that thei sholde go with as moche peple as thei\nmyght brynge of hem that were lefte of the bataile to the Citee of\nHuydecan for to garnyssh it there.  And so thei dide it stuffe.  And\nthat was a grete Citee and a stronge.

Now lete eche man sey that hym likes, for I haue seide myn\nadvise.\" Than a-ros the kynge loot and seide, \"Certes, sirs, I can not\nse how we may vs so garnysh, and the marches where as\nthei go and come, but that we shull haue grete damage of the\nkynge Arthur, be the helpe of the two kynges and of Merlin, that\nknoweth all oure ordenaunce, and he ne loveth vs nothinge, ffor\nas soone as thei knowe that the Saxons be entred, thei shull come\nfor to distroye vs fro Tintagell, where thei haue sette theire\nwardes; and on the tother syde toward brialen, that is vij myle\nfro Tyntagell, thei will assaile vs ofte sithes; and also at the\nCastell del la Roche, ther thei haue made her garnyson that\nmay vs moche greve, ffor thei haue it stuffid with vitaile\nand peple that thei haue no drede of vs, ne of the saxons\nthat be risen a-gein vs by the discorde that is be-twene vs,\nand therefore I sey, yef thei renne vpon on two partyes we\nshull haue grete disese, for yef the Saxons haue the hier honde\nof vs, we shull firste be distroyed; and as for me, I ne sey not\nbut that I am redy to pursue what that euer ye will ordeyne\nand do, and therfore sey better yef ye can.\" With this a-rose the kynge de Cent chiualers and seide,\n\"Feire lordes, of that the kynge loot seith that he douteth\nthe kynge Arthur, and the kynge ban, and the kynge boors, of\nGannes, and his helpers, of this we nede not to drede, ffor a\nmessager me tolde this othir day that kynge Arthur, and kynge ban,\nand kynge Boors his brother, ben gon oute of this contrei and go to\nsocour the kynge leodegan, of Tamelide, that hath werre a-gein the\nkynge Rion, of Irelonde, and thei go in manner of sowdiours, and\nall this hath Merlin I-made; but he hath well stuffed alle his\nforteresses, for he knoweth well of this that is vs be-fallen,\nwhere-fore he goth the more hardely, for he knoweth well he dare haue\nno drede of vs. and of his londe haue ye no fere of no damage;\nand yef he ne were not gon, I wolde wele counseile that the peas\nwere made be-twene hym and vs in somme maner wise, that he\nmyght vs helpe to drive oute this hethene peple out of this londe\nthat neuer shall a-wey be enchased but god sette to his counseile, and the beste that I can se is that the marches be garnysshed as\nthe kynge Tradilyuaunt hath seide; and whan the marches ben\ngarnysshed, than moste we take counseile of oon stronge Castell\nthat thei haue in this contrey, that is cleped the roche of saxons,\nwherof a feire mayden is lady that is suster to Hardogebrant that\nmoche knoweth of egremauncye, be whom thei haue grete socour\nand helpe but yef we take hasty counseile.\" Whan the lordes vndirstod that kynge Arthur was gon and\nlefte his londe, than thei hadde grete thought wherefore\nit myght be; but no wise cowde thei devise the cause, but that\nthei wiste wele that Merlin it made, and yef the myght thei\nwolde repente with gode will of the stryfe that thei hadde a-gein\nMerlin, but to late thei were to repente.  And in the ende thei\nacorded to garnysshe the marches of Galnoye and of Gorre, and\nof galuonye towarde Cornewaile and Orcanye.  And than thay\nsente after grete and smale, alle tho that myght bere armes, and\nsowdioures of straunge londes that wolde take wages, and tho\nthat coveyted lose and pris; and so litill and litill thei\nencresed.  But oute of the londe that longed to kynge Arthur ne com not\noon sole man, for thei hadde no couetise of theire auers, for theire\nlorde hadde hem yoven I-nough. The first Citee that these kynges stuffed was Nauntes in\nbreteyne, that was towarde Cornewaile, for it was a\npassage ther the Saxons repeired moste.  And thedir yede the\nkynge Ydiers with iij Ml men of armes of hem that ascaped fro the\nbataile.  And whan the kynge Ydiers was come, thei of the Citee\nwere gladde, for thei   were in grete affray, and with-oute counseile\nof the saisnes, that all day rode thourgh the londe, and so moche\nbe purchased of kynges and Dukes as he that was enterpendant,\nthat he hadde vij Ml at his baner of Sowdiours.  And thei kepte\nwele the contre ther-a-boute, and ofte tyme fought thei with the\nsaisnes, and ofte sithes thei wonne.  And so com the renoun in to\nthe hoste, that thei durste not ride that wey with-oute grete\nfoyson of peple.  And so on that part the kynge Ydiers kepte\nhem so streyte that thei myght haue no socoure of no vitaile. The tother Citee that thei yede to stuffe was cleped\nWydesans, and thedir yede the kynge Ventres of Garlot, and\nledde with hym knyghtes that were lefte of the hoste.  And\nwhan thei com to Wydesande in Cornewaile the lordes made\nhym grete ffeste, for gretly were thei discounforted of the grete\nhoste of saisnes that thei hadden seyn passe be-fore the Citee, and\nledde a-wey alle theire prayes, and alle theire townes a-boute\nbrente and exiled.  And as soone as kynge Ventres was come, he\nstuffed it wele with vitaile and with peple, and sesed the beste\ntour and the beste fortresse.  Than sente he for sowdiours thourgh\nthe londe, and in other contreyes, so that he hadde a vij Ml what\non horse-bakke and on fote men with hem of the contrey, where-of\nwere v Ml defensable.  And so wele he kepte his marches that the\nsaisnes hadde but litill socour, and ofte sithes he faught with\nhem where the saisnes loste more than wonne; ffor the kynge\nVentres was a noble knyght and hardy and enterpendaunt.  He\nhadde a sone be his wyf, a yonge bacheler of xvj yere of age,\nthat was of merveilouse grete bewte; and the wif of kynge\nVentres was suster to kynge Arthur on his moder side, Ygerne, that\nwas wif to Vterpendragon, and wif also to Hoel, Duke of\nTintagell, that be-gat basyne, the wif of kynge Ventres.  And vpon this\nbasyne be-gate he his sone, that was so gode a knyght and hardy,\nas ye shall here her-after, and how he was oon of the C.C.l.\nknyghtes of the rounde table, and oon of the moste preysed, and\nhis right name was Galashyn, the Duke of Clarence, that the\nkynge Arthur hym yaf after he hadde wedded his wif\nGonnore.  This Galashene of whom I speke, whan that herde tidinges how the\nkynge Ventres his fader hadde foughten with kynge Arthur, his\noncle, and he herde the grete prowesse and the grete debonertee\nthat was in hym, he com to hys moder basyne, and seide.  \"Feire\nmoder, ne were not ye doughter to Duke Hoel of Tintagell and\nto the quene Ygerne, that after was wif to Vterpendragon, that\nbe-gat, as I herde sey, thys kynge that is cleped be his right\nname, Arthur, that is so noble and worthi a knyght that xj\nprinces hath disconfited with so small a peple as he hadde as I\nhaue herde sey?  I pray yow telle me the trowthe yef ye can, how it is, for I may not trowe that he sholde be of soche herte\nas it recorded of hym, but yef he were sone unto Vterpendragon,\nthat in hys tyme was oon of the beste knyghtes of the worlde.\" Whan the moder vndirstode here sone that so here a-resoned,\nhir yen be-gonne to water, that the teers wette her\nchekes and hir chyn, and seide, sighynge and wepinge as\nshe that was hevy and tender for her brother that hir sone\nremembred, \"Ffeire sone,\" quod she, \"knowe this truly that he\nis youre vncle and my brother and cosin to youre fader on the\nmodirside of Vterpendragon, as I haue herde my moder sey many\ntymes whan she here complayned prively in her chamber for her\nsone that the kynge Vterpendragon made it to be delyuered to a\ncherll as sone as it was born, and how all the matere hath sethe\nbe discouered of Antor, that hym hath norisshed, be-fore the\nbarouns to whom that Merlin tolde the trouthe, and how that\nVlfin dide witnesse this thinge for trewe, that so wele was\ntrusted of Vterpendragon, and how he ordeyned the mariage of\nmy moder and the kynge; but the barouns of this londe ne will\nnot knowe hym for her lorde, and oure lorde, that is so\nmercyfull, hath hym chosen thourgh his high myracle that he hath\nshewed many sithes.\"  And than she tolde hym of the ston and\nof the swerde, and alle the auenture as it was be-fallen.  And\nwhan Galashene vndirstode his moder, he prayed god that thei\nsholde neuer wele spede that hym were ageyns, \"and,\" quod he,\n\"god lete me neuer dye till that he hath made me knyght.  Ha\nnow god yeve me grace to do so moche that he may me girthe\nwith my swerde, and I shall neuer departe fro hym while I may\nlyve yef he will me with-holde a-boute hym.\"  With that he\ndeparted from his moder and yede into a chamber, and be-gan to\nstodye howe he myght spede to go to the kynge Arthur.  Than\nhe be-thought hym to sende a messenger to Gaweyn, the sone\nof kynge loot, his cosin, and sende hym worde that he sholde\ncome to speke with hym at newewerke, in brochelonde, as\npryvely as he myght, and that he be there the thirde day after\nPhasche with-oute eny faile.  Than Galashene com oute of the\nchamber and gat hym a messenger and sente to his cosin Gaweyn. But now rested the tale of the message of Galashene and speke\nof the kynges, how thei departed fro Shorhant, and wheder thei\nwente, and telleth of the auentres that to hem be-fillen. Now, seith the boke, that after that kynge ventres, of Garlot,\nwas departed fro the Citee of Sorhant, and the other\nbarouns also, as ye haue herde, That than the kynge loot wente\nto the Citee of Gale with iij Ml knyghtes and fightynge men of\nhem that were lefte in the bataile where thei hadde be\ndiscounfited.  And whan he com thider the Cetizenis made of hym grete\nioye, ffor gretly thei were affraied of the saisnes that eche day\nrode and renne thourgh the contrey, and toke prayes and putte\nfire in townes and vilages all a-bowte as thei wente, and dide grete\ndamage.  And whan the kynge was come thider he sente and\nsomowned all the peple that he myght, bothe fer and nygh, of\nsowdiers, and with-Inne a monethe he hadde assembled mo than\nviij Ml on horse and on fote, alle defensable, with-oute hem of the\nCitee, where-of were iiij Ml for to kepe the Citee.  And he kepte\nright wele the Citee and the contre environ that noon that entred\nne myght but litill it mysdo; and ofte tymes he faught with the\nsaisnes whan that he herde telle that thei come to forrey, and\nther wan the pore bacheleres that ther-to hadde grete myster;\nand ther the kynge loot ne toke neuer thinge fro hem that thei\ndide wynne, but frely yaf hem all, and ther thourgh encresed\nhis grete loos that the peple hym yaf.  And therfore com to\nhym moo than iij Ml men for the grete bounte that thei herde of\nhym speke, whiche ne wolde neuere haue hym seyn but for the\nhigh renoun that was of hym spoken, and that he was manly and\nwise and full of largesse, and ther-of shewed wele his sones after\nhym, but oon yet more than another, after the gode lynage that\nthei were come of, and I shall telle yow how. This is trouthe that the wife of kynge lotte was suster to\nkynge Arthur by his moder side, in the same manere as was\nthe wif of kynge ventres.  And of the wif of kynge loot com\nGawein, and Agrauayn, and Gaheret, and Gaheries; these iiij\nwere sones to kynge loot.  And of hir also com Mordred, that\nwas the yonghest, that the kynge Arthur be-gat.  And I will telle yow in what manere, for so moche is the storye, the more\nclere that I make yow to vndirstonde in what wise he was\nbe-geten of the kynge; for moche peple it preyse the lesse that\nknowe not the trouthe.  Hit be-fill in the tyme that the barouns\nof the reame of logres were assembled at Cardoell in walys, for\nto chese a kynge after the deth of Vterpendragon.  And the\nkynge loot brought thider his wif, and so dide many a-nother\nbaroun.  Hit fill so that the kynge loot was loigged in a faire\nhalle, he and his meyne; and in the same loigynge was Antor\nand his sone Kay and Arthur, in the pryvieste wise that he\nmyght.  And whan the kynge knewe that he was a knyght, he made hym\nsitte at his table, and Kay, that was a yonge knyght.  And the\nkynge lotte hadde do made a cowche in a chamber, where he and\nhis wif lay.  And Antor lay in myddell of the same chamber,\nand kay and Arthur hadde made her bedde atte the chamber\ndore of kynge loot, in a corner, like as a squyre sholde\nly.  Arthur was a feire yonge squyer; and he toke grete hede of the\nlady and of hem that were a-bouten hire.  And he saugh that she\nwas feire and full of grete bewte, and in his herte he covetted\nher gretly and loved; but the lady ne knewe it not, ne toke\nther-of noon heede, for she was of grete bounte and right trewe to\nhir lorde.  Hit fill that the barouns hadde take a counseile for to\nspeke to-geder at the blak crosse.  And whi it was cleped the\nblake crosse ye shall here her-after, and the names of the knyghtes\nof the rounde table, but yet the tyme is not come to speke ther-of\nmore.  At this crosse the barouns toke a day for to assemble erly\non a morowe; and so it fill that on the nyght before that the\nkynge loot sholde go to this counseile, and he comaunded that\nprevily his horse were sadeled a-boute mydnyght and his armes\nwere alle redy.  And thei dide all his comaundement so secretly\nthat noon it perceyved, ne not the lady her-self.  Thus a-roos the\nkynge a-boute mydnyght, that his it ne wyste ne a-percyved it\nnought.  And he wente to the parlement to the blake crosse, and\nthe lady lefte a-lone in the chamber in her bedde.  And Arthur,\nthat alle this toke gode kepe, sawgh well how the kynge was\ngon.  And he a-roos as stilliche as he myght, and yede to bedde to the lady, and lay turnynge and wendynge, that noon other\nthynge durste do leste the lady sholde hym a-perceyve.  And hit\nfill so that the lady a-woke and turned hir toward hym, and toke\nhym in her armes as a woman slepynge, that wende verely it\nhadde ben her lorde.  And that nyght was be-gete Mordred, as\nye haue herde.  And whan he hadde don his delite with the\nquene, a-noon after she fill on slepe.  And Aurthur a-roos sleyly\nthat he was not a-perceyved, till on the morowe, that he\nhym-self it tolde at the dyner, whan he serued her at table\nknelynge.  And so it happed that the lady seide, \"Sir squyre,\narise vp, for longe I-nough haue ye be knelynge.\"  And he\nansuerde softly, and seide that he ne myght neuer deserue the\nbountees that she hadde hym don.  And she hym asked what\nbounte it was that she hadde hym don.  And he ansuerde he\nwolde not in no wise telle it here but yef she hym ensured that\nshe sholde hym not discouer to no pesone, ne purchase hym no\nblame, ne harme.  And she seide that it sholde not hir greve, and\nensured hym with gode will, as she that of this thynge ne toke\nnoon kepe.  And than he tolde hir how he hadde leyn by her\nthat nyght; and than hadde the lady grete shame, and wax all\nrody, but noon ne knewe the cause.  And than the lady lefte her\nmere vntterly.  And thus lay Arthur by his suster, the wif of\nkynge loot, but neuer after it fill her no more.  And so the lady\nvndirstode that she was grete by hym; and the childe that she\nhadde at that tyme was of hym with-oute faile.  And whan the\nchilde was born, and also the tidynges spredde a-brode that he was\nthe sone of Vterpendragon, she loved hym so moche in her herte,\nthat no man myght it telle.  But she durste make no semblant,\nfor the kynge loot hir lorde; and she was sory for the werre that\nwas be-twene hym and the barons of the reame. Upon a day Gawein com fro huntynge, and clothed comly in\na robe that was warme as a robe for the wynter, and\nledde in honde a leeshe of grehoundes, and ledde also two brace\nfolowinge hym.  And it be-com hym full wele all thynge that\nhe dide:  and he also was of the feirest makynge that eny man\nmyght be as of his stature.  But the tale ne of hym deviseth no more here saf only of a tecche that he hadde, that whan he a-roos\nthat he hadde the force and myght of the beste knyght that\nmyght be founde, and whan he com to the houre of pryme he\ndoubled, and at the houre of tierce also; and whan it come\nto mydday he com a-gein to his firste strength that he hadde\nat the houre of tierce; and whan it come to the houre of\nnoone he doubled, and alle houres of the nyght, and in the\nmorowe he com a-gein to his firste force; this was the\ncustome of Gawein.  Whan Gawein entred the halle, as ye harde,\nhis moder lay in a chamber by a chymney wher-ynne was a grete\nfiere, and she was right pensif for her brother the kynge Arthur,\nand for the barouns that were departed fro hym in euyll will, and\nof the grete mortalite of peple that was come by the foly of the\nbarouns of the londe, and also of the saisnes that were entred\nin to the londe, wher-fore thei were in a venture to be distroide;\nand ther was she sore dismayed. And whan the lady saugh Gawein, that was so feire a yonge\nsquyer and noche of his age, and thought it tyme for\nhym to a knyght, and than she be-gan to wepe and that hevied\nmoche Gawein, and asked wherefore that she dide wepe, and she\nansuerde and seide, \"Feire sone, that I haue grete cause, for I\nse yow and youre bretheren that spende youre tyme in foly, that\nfro hens-forth ye oughten to be knyghtes and bere armes, and ye\nsholde be at the court of kynge Arthur, for he is youre oncle,\nand is the beste knyght of the worlde as it is seide, and ye sholde\nhym serue, and purchase the pees be-twene hym and youre fader,\nfor it is grete damage of the euell will be-twene hem and the\nother barouns of the londe that sholde hym love and serue, but\nfor their pride thei dyne not hym to knowe for her lorde, and\nwele it sheweth that it displeseth our lorde, for more haue thei\nloste than wonne in here stryf; and on the tother side the saisnes be\nentred in to the londe that vs will distoye but yef god vs helpe,\nand ne we ne shull no helpe haue of hym that sholde hem alle\nenchace oute of this londe that is the kynge Arthur, and therfore\nar ye moche to blame and youre bretheren , for now sholde ye\nbere armes and seche the acorde of youre oncle and of youre fader by what wey thei myght be made frendes, and yo do\nnought elles euery day but hunte after the hare thourght the\nfeldes, and so lese ye youre tyme, and ther-fore me semethe ye\nought ot haue blame.\" Whan Gawein vndirstode his moder, he seide, \"Moder, sey\nye for trouthe that this Arthur that now is kynge that\nhe be youre brother and myn oncle?\"  \"Feire sone,\" seide she,\n\"ne doute yow nought, for youre oncle is he trewly.\"  And than\nshe tolde hym, fro the be-gynynge to the ende, all how it\nwas.  And whan Gawein hadde all vndirstonde, he seide full debonerly,\n\"Feire moder, ne be not ther-fore so pensif, for, be the feith that\nI owe on to yow, I shall neuer be girde with swerde ne bere\nhelme on myn hede till that the kynge Arthur make me knyght,\nyef in me be so moche valoure that he will me a-dubbe, and we will\ngo to courte for to fecche oure armes and helpe to mayntene his\nlordship a-gein alle tho that hym will greve or anoye.\"  \"Feire\nsone,\" than seide the lady, \"for me shull ye neuer be letted, ffor\ngrete gladnesse sholde it be to me yef oure lorde wolde graunte\nthat ye might do so moche that youre fader and youre oncle were\ngode frendes, for than sholde I haue gladnesse at myn herte, and\nI ought wele aboue alle other.\"  \"Dame,\" quod Gawein, \"cesseth\nnow at this tyme, for wete it well, by I ones oute of my fader\nhouse, I will neuer returne ne entre ther-ynne a-gayn till that\nmy fader and myn oncle be acorded, though that I sholde do right\nmoche a-gein my fader will.\"  \"Feire sone,\" seide the moder,\nmoder, \"god graunte yow grace this to performe.\" In the tyme that Gawein and his moder spake thus to-geder\ncom in Agravayn and Gaharet and Gaheries, and com\nbe-fore theire moder, that heilde stille her talkynge with\nGawein.  And than seide Agravain to Gawein, \"Ye be more to blame than\neny other, for ye be oure eldeste brother, and ye ought to lede vs\nforth, and that we sholde be knyghtes, and serue hym that all the\nworlde of speketh that a-boute hym repeire.  And we ne do but\nas musardes, and ne a-wayte nought elles but whan we shall be\ntake as a bridde in a nette, for the saisnes be but a iourne hens,\nthat all the contre robbe and distroye.  Ne we ne haue not peple to chase hem hens but by the prowesse of the kynge\nArthur.  But lete us take oure armes of hym, and helpe to defende his\nlonde a-gein his enmyes; ffor that is the beste that I can se, for\nhere ne may we nought gete.  And, ther-fore, better it were for\nvs to do some prowesse in his servise, yef we myght be of soche\nvaloure, than here to be take to prison as cowardes, and lese oure\ntime of oure ages.\"  And whan Gawein vndirstode the speche of\nhis brother, he hadde of hym hertely ioye, and moche he hym\npreysed, and ansuerde that so wolde he do; \"and, therfore, in\nhaste lete vs a-pareile vs, for we will meve hens with-ynne xiiij\ndayes.\"  And whan the moder saugh that hadde this\nvndertaken, she was full of ioye, and thanked god hertely.  And to\nhem she seide, \"Dismay yow nought of no-thynge, for I shall\nordeyne yow horse and harneys.\"  And ther-of were thei gladde\nand merye.  But now here resteth the tale of the moder and of the\nchilderen, and speketh how the kynges departed fro Sorhant, that\nbe yet sorowfull and wroth for theire discounfiture and losse, and\nalso for the saisnes that be entred in to her londes and Contrees. Now seith the story that whan these thre kynges were\ndeparted fro their felowes fro Shorhant, that thei a-bode till\nsowderes com to hem grete plente.  And than departed Clarion,\nthe kinge of Northumberlonde, and rode to his Citee I-cleped\nbellande, that is grete and so feire, and garnysshed it wele with\nthre Ml men of armes, with-oute hem of the Citee self, that were\nwele v Ml or mo.  And he kepte wele the marches a-boute hym,\nand many tymes faught with the saisnes like as ye haue herde\ntolde.  And some tyme he wan, and many tymes he loste, as is\nthe fortune of werre.  And right moche he greved the saisnes,\nfor he distrued the prayes and the vitaile, so that the foreyours\nmyght nought fynde in the contrey for to take.  After that\ndeparted the kynge de Cent chyualiers fro the Citee of Sorhant\nwith iij Ml men of armes, and wente to the Citee of malonant,\nwhere he hadde a gentill lady.  This Cite marched to his londe,\nbut for it was nerre the passages where as the Saxons dide passe,\nthat was the cause that he com thider, for he was full of high\nprowesse, and also right a wise man and a noble knyght, and hadde euer-more in his company an hundred men on horsebak\narmed whan he hadde leeste peple; and ther-fore was he cleped\nle Roy de Cent chiualers, that is to sey, kynge of an hundred\nknyghtes; but his right name was cleped Aguysans.  And he\nkepte right wele the marche and the contrey ther-a-boute, that\nlitill wonne the sarazins vpon hym.  After that departed the\nkynge Tradylyuans, of North wales, fro the Cite of Sorhant, and\nwente in to North walis to his City with iij Ml men of\narmes.  And his peple were of hym gladde, for thei hadde be in grete\ndrede of the Saxouns, that wente thourgh the londe and dide\nhem grete harme and damage, ffor the passages were ther to go\nto the roche of saisnes, where-of thei were sore a-noyed and\ngreved.  And he sente thourgh his londe, and somowned alle\ntho that myght armes bere, and for sowdiours bothe fer and nygh,\nso that he assembled to-geder what on hors and on fote with the\npeple that he hadde brought fro the bataile vij Ml with-oute the\nmen of the Citee, wher in was iiij Ml of dwellers.  And so he hym\ndefended the beste wyse that he myght, and moche he hem\ngreved toward the Castell that Carnyle, the suster of hardogabran,\nkepte in her baillye.  Ne that passage ne myght not these thre kynges kepe for no power that thei hadden; but that ther com\nsocour be that wey to the saisnes of vitaile and of men be that\ncastell that was stronge, and by the enchauntement of Carnile,\nthat moste cowde of that art, but yef it were Morgain, the suster\nof kynge Arthur, and Nimiane, that Merlin dide love so moche,\nthat he taught here alle the merveiles of the worlde as this boke\nshall declare yow here-after.  And by that Castell where-of I\nspeke hadde the saisnes all her recouerer and all her socour of the\ncontrey, wherthurgh thei myght neuer be put oute of the londe\ntill that kynge Arthur drof hem oute, and the kynge Ban and\nthe kynge Boors of Gannes, and the sones of kynge lott, as ye\nshull here telle here-after, and of theire merveilouse prowesse of\ndedes of armes.  After that departed fro Sorhant the kynge\nBrangore, of South Walis, with iij Ml men of armes, and wente to\nStrangore, his chief Citee, for that was nexte to the roche of\nSaxouns, ant sente after soudiours vp and down, and assembled vj Ml men defensable, and moche thei greved the hethen peple\nwith alle theire power.  This kynge Brangore hadde a gentill\nlady to his wif, that was doughter to kynge Adryan, the\nEmperour of Constantynenoble, that was myghty and riche.  And\nhe hadde no mo childeren by his wif but two doughteres, where-of\nthe kynge Brangore hadde oon, and the tother was in\nCostantynnoble.  In that tyme ther was a riche lorde and a myghty, that\nwas kynge of blagne and of hungre; but he deyde with-ynne\nv yere after he was wedded, and lefte a sone, the feirest creature\nof man that was formed.  And this childe dide wex moche and\nsemly, and right wise and hardy.  And at that day that kynge\nBrangore was departed fro Sorhant, he was so well waxen that\nhe was able to be a knyght; and his right name was\nSegramore.  This Segramore that I of speke dide after-warde many high\nprowesse in the reame of logres, whereof the tale shall declare\nyow here-after, and I shall tell yow how it fill. Renomee that thurgh alle the worlde renneth yede so\nthourgh euery londe, so that euery contrey spake of the\nkynge Arthur and of his grete largesse.  And so his renoun\nspredde thourgh euery contre, so that in Costantynnoble it was\nin euery mannes mouthe; So that Segramore herde ther-of speke,\nand was but xv yere of age, and was oon of the feirest men of\nthe worlde, and of large stature, and beste shapen of alle\nmembres, and ther-to hardy and wise.  And whan he herde tidynges\nof the kynge Arthur he desired gretly to se the day and the houre\nthat he myght be made knyght of hys honde, and seide often to\nhem that were of his counseile that who so myght take ordere of\nchiualrye moste in eny wise be a gode knyght.  And whan his\ngraunt-sire, the kynge Adrian, that tho was livynge, counseiled\nhym to take the ordere of knyghthode, for he was the next heire\nmale to the Empere after his deth.  And he hym ansuerde that he\nwolde neuer be knyght till that Arthur, the kynge of grete\nbreteyne, hadde made hym a knyght with his owne\nhondes.  And so here-of spake thei day be day till that the kynge Adrian\nappareiled Segramore, and sente hym to the grete breteyne\nrichely arayed.  But now cesseth of hym to speke more at this tyme, and turneth to telle how these other knyges departed\nfro Sorhant. Now seith the storye that as soone as kynge Brangore was\ndeparted fro Sorhant, that the kynge Carados made hym\nredy to ryde; and with hym he hadde iij Ml men armed, and yede\nto Eastrangore, his chief Citee, and hit garnysshit vigorously, as\nhe that was full of prowesse and grete hardynesse, and sente\nafter knyghtes and sergeantes, alle that he myght haue he hadde\nassembled, vij Ml speres and gode men of werre.  And in tho\npartyes the saisnes ne soiourned but litill, for often were the\nfoughten bothe even and morowe as thei saugh tyme.  And often\nCarados and his company lay in the forestes, that were large and\ndepe; and whan he herde telle that the saisnes com in forrey\nthourgh the contrey, he lepe hem a-geyns and faught with hem,\nso that ofte tymes he gat vpon hem and mayntened so the werre\nlonge tyme, as the tale will reherse here-after whan the mater\ncometh ther-to.  And after that these vj kynges were departed\nfro Sorhant, departed than Aguysans, the kynge of Scotlonde. This Aguysans, the kynge of Scotlonde, that departed out of\nSorhant, was the richest kynge of alle the xj kynges,\nand was also the yongeste; but of armes he cowde not so moche\nas the other kynges.  And he assembled his peple, and were\nv Ml , and wente to Corenge in Scotlonde, that tho was a grete\nCitee and a riche, and moche were greved with the saisnes that\nrepeired ther-a-bowte, for it was but xx scotyssh myle fro the\nCastell of Vandesbires, ther-as was the sege of saisnes, that\nrepeyred ther-a-boute so grete peple that noon myght hem nombre\nthat ther assembled euery day.  And as soone as that the kynge\nAguysans was sette in the Citee of Corenges, thei were gladde\nthat were in the Citee of whiche were v Ml .  And he sente alle\na-boute for sowdiours on hors and on fote, so that he hadde x Ml with-oute hem of the Cite.  And so he faught many tymes with\nthe saisnes as thei ronne thourgh the Contrey; and so he bothe\nloste and wan many tymes.  And he made to a-mende and fortyfie\nthe wallis of the town ther as, as thei were most feble; and thus\nhe mayntened the werre longe tyme.  After that these kynges were departed, the Duke Escam assembled his peple, and hadde\nwith hym iiij Ml men of armes; and he iourneyde so till he com to\nCambenyk, his stronge Citee, that was grete and riche and full\nof alle maner godes, and with-ynne the Cite were iij Ml men\ndefensable, that of the Duke made grete ioye when thei hym saugh, for\ngretly hadde thei be affraide of the saisnes that thei hadde\nseyn come towarde a Castell that is cleped Arondell, that was in\nthe marche of Cambenyk, and the roche of Saisnes, that the\nkynge Arthur hadde well garnysshid er he wente in to the\nreame of Tamelide.  And as soone as the Duke com to Cambenyk\nhe comaunded and somowned all his power fer and nygh, and\nassembled wele viij Ml men with-oute hem that were in the Citee;\nand thise greved the saisnes at theire power.  In this maner the\nDuke hym contened in this maner richely as ye haue herde.  Thus\ndepartet the xj barouns fro Sorhant; and the kynge Vrien leffte\nin his Citee, and sente thourgh euery londe and contrey a-boute,\nand sowdiours so that he hadde to-geder ix Ml , with-oute the peple\nof the Citee, where-of were wele vj Ml , and the sege was thens\nbut a iourne.  And so thei fought to-geder many tymes, and loste\nand wonne as is the fortune of werre.  And thus this stryfe lastid\nlonge tyme, so that the contrey was wasted and made pore so sore\nthat in v yere ther in was nought to gete.  And in the contrey\nthey lived by nought elles saf by that oon myght take of a-nother\nby-twene the cristen men and the saisnes, but yef eny ship by\naventure a-rived at eny port in the londe.  In this manere were\nthei sustened that other-wise ne laboured not, but werred that\noon a-gein that other right harde.  And the saisnes ronne thourgh\nthe londe of kynge Arthur, and \u00feer-Inne dide grete damage, for\nther was noon that hem dide lette, till that by a-uenture, as god\nwolde, he sente feire yonge squires and gentill it to socoure.  And\nI shall telle yow what thei were that so longe kepte the londes\nof kynge Arthur, till that he com a-geyn oute of the londe of\nTamelide; so that the saisnes loste more and the barouns, that\nwere his enmyes, than dide Arthur.  And now returneth the tale\na-gein to Galashyn, the sone of kynge Ventres.", "12": "CHAPTER XIII. THE ADVENTURES OF GAWEIN, AGRAVAYN, GAHARET, GAHERIES, AND GALESHYN; AND THEIR BATTLE WITH THE SAXONS. Now, seith the boke, that as soone as Galeshene hadde lerned\nof the tydinges of kynge Arthur, and knewe that he\nwas his oncle, he toke a messenger, and sente to Gawein his\ncosyn, and prayde hym to speke with hym at newerk in privy\nwise, and to brynge with hym his bretheren, and that he faile not\nto be ther the thirde day after Pasche.  The messenger iourneyed\nforth till he com in to walis, in the marche af Orcanye, and spake\nwith Gawein and his bretheren, and seide how Galeshene grete\nhym wele, and sente hym worde and praide hym as dere as he\nhym loved, to mete with hym at newerk, in brochelonde, the\nthirde day after Pasch, for ther he wolde be with-oute faile yef\nhe were in hele of his body.  And whan thei herde this message\nthey made grete ioye, and seide ther wolde thei be with-oute\nfaile, for thei wiste wele he ne sente not for hem with-oute\ngrete cause.  And thei yaf the messager a gode stede, and sente\nhym a-gein glad and mery.  And he spedde hym till he come to\nGaleshene, and tolde hym his ansuere that he hadde of his\ncosyns. Whan the messengere com be-fore Galeshene, his lorde, he\nseide how his cosyns grete hym wele, and that thei\nwolde be at newerke, in brochelonde, the thirde day after Pasch\nwith-oute faile.  Than Galeshene dide hym appareile, and wente\nthe nexte day after pasch to newerke, in brochelonde.  And\nwhan he com thider, Gawein ne hys bretheren were not yet\nI-come.  And ther he a-bode till they were come.  Whan Gawein\nand his bretheren were come, Galashin made to hem grete\nfeste.  And than seide Gawein to Galashin, \"Feire cosin, ye sente for\nto seche me this othir day by youre message that I and my\nbretheren sholde come speke with yow; and trewly ne were that\nI wolde take my leve of yow, I wolde elles by this time haue be\nelles where, that I haue moche for to do, and so moche I desire to be there a-bove alle other thynge.\"  \"Sire,\" seide Galeshin,\n\"whider sholde ye haue gon, for with-oute me ne sholde ye not\ngo, but that I therof sholde haue wytinge; and ther-fore telle\nme what wey ye purposeth yow to go, and after I shall telle yow\nmy corage, and why I have sente for to speke with yow and my\ncosins youre bretheren.\"  Than seide Gawein, \"Trewly, cosin, I\nwill go se the grete prowesse and largesse of the free and\ndeboniere and the moste worthi knyght of the worlde, of whom I haue\nherde reporte the moste wurship and honoure.\"  \"A god\nmercy!\"  quod Galeshyn, \"who is that?  god graunte that it be he that\ncauseth me to come speke with yow.\"  \"Forsothe,\" seide Gawein,\n\"his name ne ought not to be hidde, but to be publisshed\na-fore eny worthy man, for it is the kynge Arthur; but with grete\nwronge and a-gein right do the barouns of this londe a-gein hym\nwerre, and in especiall thei that ought hym to love and holde\nmoste dere; and wite ye well, so god me helpe,\" seide Gawein,\n\"that I shall neuer be with swerde girte till that he me\ngirde.\"  Whan Galashyn hadde herde that Gawein hadde seide, he was\nneuer er so gladde, and ran to Gawein with armes spredde,\nand made to hym soche ioye and feste as all the worlde hadde\nben his, and seide that for noon thynge ellis hadde he sente\nto hym fore, and tolde hym worde for worde all his corage, and\nthe wordes of his moder that she hadde seide; and ther a-gein\nGawein hym tolde the wordes of hys moder.  Whan the\nchilderen hadde spoke to-geder, thei acorded to meve with-inne xv\ndayes.  Than thei departed, and made redy theire horse and\ntheire armes, as was convenient to so high men sones; and, to\nsey brefly, Galashyn purchesed in his company CC of the beste\nknyghtes that he cowde chese, and than departed with-oute\nwitynge of his fader, and rode be the moste vn-couthe weyes\nthat thei myght till he com to newerke, in brochelonde, and ther\na-bode the comynge of Gawein and his bretheren, that brought in\nher company v C men of knyghtes and squyres that alle were\nknyghtes sones; but ther ne were lx knyghtes, and amonge hem that com with Galashin but xx knyghtes.  And whan thei were\nall assembled thei made to-geder grete ioye.  And than thei toke\ncounseile to-geder how it was to do; and thei a-corded to go to\nlogres in bretein, the chief Citee of kynge Arthur; and ther\nsholde thei here speke of the kynge her oncle, and also of the\nsarazins that repaired ther-a-boute. Now, seith the boke, that a-boute the entre of may, in the\ntyme whan these briddes syngith with clier voys and\nall thynge reioyseth, and than these wodes and medowes beth\nflorished grene, and these medowes full of newe tendir erbys and\nentermedled with dyuerse colours that swote be of odoures, and\nthese amerouse yonge lusty peple reioyse be-cause of the lusty\nseson, it be-fill that Gawein and Agrauayn and Gaharet and\nGaheries and Galashyn, and thei that be-come in here companye,\nben risen erly, for the heete that dide hem grete anoye on the\nday, as they that wolde ride in the cole of the mornynge that\nwas feire and stille and a softe weder, and thei were yonge and\ntender to suffre grete trauayle, and thei were wele armed, and\nhadde on hattes of stile as squyres vsed in tho dayes, and theire\nswerdes hangynge at the pomell of theire sadeles be-fore, for the\ncontrey was not sure for the saisnes that rode and ronne thourgh\nthe contrey for vitaile and for to robbe and distrye the londe that\nwas so plentenouse and riche er the mysbelevynge peple were\nentred, wherof was grete pite that so goode a londe sholde be\ndistroyed for synne and for myslyvinge, as god hath ofte sithes\nchastysed diuerse remes. The thirde daye that thise childeren rode to-geder lyke as\nthat ye haue herde, thei mette the kynge leodobron and\nthe kynge Segagan and the kynge Mandalet and the kynge\nSernagut, of the londe of yroys, that hadde the contre a-boute logres\nbrent and wasted, and ledde with hem grete plente of vitaile, so\nthat the hoste for longe tyme was refresshed of brede and wyne\nand of flesh, for thei hadde so piled and robbed thourgh the\ncontrey and the portes where the shippes were a-ryved, and the marchaundise was so grete, that v C someres were charged, and xxv\ncartes and vij carres, and the cariage and the multitude of peple\nwas so grete, that the duste a-rose so huge, that vn-nethe oon myght\nknowe a-nother; and also the fiere and the smoke so grete in the\ncontrey that half a iourney a-boute men myght knowe what peple\nther were.  And whan thise childeren approched to this\nchyuachie, and herde the playntes and the cryes that the mene peple\nmade for the saisnes that hem so distroyed, that were well x Ml of\nhorse-men, with-oute the putaile that ronne vp and down and\nrobbed the peple and brente the vilages as they passed thourgh\nthe Contrey. Whan the childeren saugh this doloure and this sorowe, thei\nasked of hem that passed by that thei saugh so affraied\nwhere that kynge Arthur was, and they seyde he was gon in to\nTamalide at mydlenton, and hadde wele garnysshed alle the\nforteresses of his londe that noon ne myght not gretly forfete,\nand thei were so doilfull that the sarazins so distroied the londe\nas ye haue herde.  And whan the childeren herde that the kynge\nwas not in the contrey, thei seide thei wolde the londe and the\ncontrey for her oncle, and also the pray that the saisnes ledden,\nand that thei wolde kepe the londe and it deffende till here oncle\nwere come home.  And whan the peple of the contrey herde hem\nspeke thus, thei asked of hem what thei were that so wolde\ndeffende the londe of kynge Arthur, as thei seiden; and thei lete\nhem be knowen what thei were.  And whan the peple knewe\nwhat the childeren weren thei hadde grete ioye, for by hem thei\ntrowed that the kynge Arthur sholde be lorde of all the reame\nof logres, and the love of the fadres he sholde haue thourgh the\nchilderen that ther were come, with thise v cosins, and with\nother that were ryche mennes sones, as Castelleins and\nvauasours of the londe, that after were of grete prowesse in the house\nof kynge Arthur, and of soche as were moste preysed.  And as\nsoone as the childeren saugh the grete damage, theire hertis\nbegonne to ryse, and cried, \"As armes, gentill squyres, for now\nshall it be sene how is goode and hardy and worthy to bere\narmes, for we be in oure heritages, and ther-fore we sholde deffende oure right a-gein these mysbelevynge peple, that thus this\nlonde robbed and wasted.\" Hastely ronne these squyers to armes, and lepen to horse,\nand hem renged and distreyned, as the knyghtes hem\ntaughten, whereof were xxiiij that were noble men and right gode\nknyghtes and trewe.  And whan the peple of the contre saugh\nthat thei hadde socoure, ther com to hem more than v C what on\nhorse and on fote.  And than thei yede to-geder as starlynges,\nand mette firste the cariage and the vitaile that the saisnes ledden\ntowarde the hoste, and were moo than iij Ml with the cariage.\nAnd, as the storye seith, it was passed mydday and was right hote\nweder.  And the duste a-rose so thikke that scantly a man myght\nse fro hym-self the caste of a stone.  And as soone at that the\nchilderen saugh theire enmyes, thei lete theire horse renne, and\noverthrewe and slowgh alle that thei ateyned, that ther ne\nascaped oon ne other.  That day Gawein slowgh many a sarazin\nof the saxouns more than eny of his felowes, so that he was all\nblody, bothe he and his horse.  And he heiled an axe in his\nhonde, and he was so crewell and fiers that whom he a-raught a\nfull stroke neded hym no salue.  And his other bretheren dide also\nright wele, so that noon of hem ne durste a-bide of hem a\nstroke.  And Galashyn was all day with Gawein, that merveilously dide\nwele, for ther myght noon endure his strokes that he ne smote of\narme, or legge, or heede, or other membre; but, a-bove alle othir,\nit was merveile to se the martire that Gawein made, for a-gein\nhis strokys ne myght not endure Iren ne style, ne no mannys\nbody, were he neuer so myghty ne stronge.  And so the\nchilderen smyten vp and down a-boute hem that of iij Ml that ledde the\npray towarde the hoste, ne ascaped not xxx ti .  And x of hem\nthat ascaped returned vn-to her chiuachie, that were comynge after\nwith vij Ml , but thei were not wele armed, for thei hadde made it\nto be trussed for the grete hete that hem greved.  And whan the\nx that fledden com in to the hoste thei cryed that all was deed\nthat were lefte with the cariage.  Whan thei herde that all was\nloste, thei ronne to theire armes alle they that eny hadden, and\nhem armed in the beste wise that thei myght.  And the thirde part of hem ne myght not come to theire armoure, for theire\nsquyers were gon be-fore with the cariage that the childeren\nhadde wonne, and let it be ledde to logres, and lete it be\ncondited by men of the same contrey, that the were dwellynge and\nweren fallen in to theire company; and after thei pursude the\nsaisnes that fledden in to the tyme that thei were fallen in\namonge the rerewarde.  Ther than was fierce bataile and stronge\nstoure, and harde and crewell, that merveile it was to haue\nseyn.  Ther Gawein slowe the kynge noas, of Iselonde, for he smote hym\nwith an axe with bothe hondis, that he cleft hym to the briste\nbon.  And Galashyn smote so the kynge Sarnagut with a swerde\ntrenchaunt that he made his heede fle in to the feilde.  And\nAgrauayn, that was plonged in to the presse, smote on bothe\nsides hym a-boute, and began yeve so grete strokes that sore thei\nhym douted.  And Gaheries hadde chased Gynebande the length\nof a bowe draught from his felowes, for that he hadde smyte\ndown his brother Gaheret with a spere, but he hadde noon other\nharm; and, therfore, wende well Gaheries he hadde be slayn;\nand, therfore, he pursude vpon hym with swerde drawen, as\nfiercely as a wilde boor. Whan Guynebans saugh Gaheries so fiercely come, he turned\nto flight, for he ne durste not a-bide for the grete\nmerveilouse occision that he hadde seyn hym do; and,\nwithoute faile, he was of merveilouse prowesse, for, as the story\nreherseth, it failed but litill that he was even like of bounte\nto Gawein his brother, whan he com to his right age and was\nknyght.  And whan Gaheries saugh the sarazin thus fleynge,\nhe swore be god that he sholde neuer cesse ne leve hym, for\nplayn ne wode, till he were a-venged of his brother deth.  And\nso he hym chased as faste as his horse myght hym bere till\nhe hadde lefte his felowes be-hynde the space of an\narblaste.  And so he hym overtoke a-monge the meyne of Guynebans,\nthat com redy to fight, and gladde were they of the pray\nthat thei hadde so ledde. Whan Gaheries hadde overtake Guynebans, he stroke hym\nso sore vpon the helme that he kutte a-wey a quarter\nthat he made hym to stope, and the swerde swarued be-twene the\nshelde and the nekke, and kyutte the gyge of the shelde with all\nthe arme so that he dide it falle in to the felde.  And whan this\nkynge saugh hym-self so dismembred he fill in swowne; and than\nGaheries was gladde of the vengaunce of his brother, and turned\nhis horse hede.  But the saisnes that this stroke hadde sein ne\ncontented not to lete hym passe; and than thei hem renged by\nhundredes and by thowsandes, and closed hym in on alle\npartyes, and smote vpon hym with theire speres at ones, and\nouer-threwe hym and his horse.  And whan the tymbir of theire\nsperes were broken, he lepe vp-on his fete vigerousely, as he that\nhadde I-nough of breth; and myght that ther was noon so hardy\nthat durste put to hys honde hym to take, and launched at hym\nfro fer speres and swerdes and knyves, that thei made hym falle\non his knees two tymes or thre; but so myght he not longe\nendure but that he sholde haue be take or deed.  Than a squyer that\nsaugh hym chase so the hethyn kynge, com cryinge and betynge\nhis hondes to-geder, and rendinge his heer to Gawein, that hadde\nremounted Gaheret vpon a-nother horse, that hadde smeten down\nthe kynge Sernage fro.  Than the squyer cried, \"Ha,\nGawein!  where-a-boute arte thow?  for thow hast loste thy brother Gaheries\nbut thow hym socoure delyuerly; for he chased a saisne that he\nhath ouertake in this derke valey, and hath hym smetyn down;\nbut the sarasins haue be-sette hym on all partyes, and haue hym\nouerthrowen, and slayn his horse, and made hym falle vpon his\nkne I wote not how often; and yef ye hym thus lese it is grete\ndoel and grete damage.\"  Whan Gawein vndirstode hym that\nmade soche doel for his brother, he seide, \"Ha!  seint Marie\nVirgin and moder of Jeshu criste, ne suffre not that I lese my\nbrother, for than myn herte shall neuer be gladde; and yef I hym\nthus lese, shall ther neuer shelde hange a-boute my nekke.\"  Than\nhe asked of the squyer whiche wey it was.  And he shewed hym\nthe valey be the wode side.  And he cryed to his felowes with\nhigh voys, \"Now shall it be sein who that shall me serve.\" \"Feire cosyn,\" quod Galashyn, \"whider will ye go in so\ngrete haste, shall noon a-bide from yow, and therfore\nset forth smartly, for I drede lest we tarye to longe?\"  Than the\nchilderen hem renged and priked as faste as quarelles of arblast,\nand perced the presse with his gode horse and heilde an axe\nin bothe handes wherewith he made soche martire and soche\nslaughter, that thei fly from hym on alle partyes; and it lasted\nthe space of a myle a-boute of the peple that thei hadde leide to\ngrounde, and thei sought vp and down till thei founde Gaheries,\nthat was lyggynge at erthe vp-right, and thei hadde pulled of his\nhatte of stiell and his coyf of mayle for to smyte of his heed, but\nthei thought to haue take hym quyk, and lede hym to Bernage,\nthe kynge of Saxon.  Than thei fillen vpon hym at ones, and\nwolde bynde his hondes be-hynde hys bakke.  Than com Gawein\nprikinge gripynge a spere, and sprange in a-monge hem so full of\nire and maltelent for that he sawgh his brother so vileinliche\na-raide, that ny he yede out of witte, and than he leide a-boute\nhym so grym strokes and rude that noon durste hym a-bide, but\ndisparbled a-brode fro hym as from a wode lyon in rage.  Whan that\nthei that heilde his brother saugh the merveile that he dide, thei ne\ndurste not a-bide ne holde his brother no lenger, but yef thei wolde\nhaue receyved the deth, but turned to flight and made hym\nwey.  Whan Gaheries saugh his brother Gawein, he lepte vpon his feet,\nand sette on his heed his hatte delyuerly, and hente a-gein his\nswerde, and appareilede hym to diffende.  And Agrauayn hym\nbrought an horse, and seide, \"Brother, now lepe vp lightly, for\ngrete foly haue ye do to go so fer oute of oure company, for full\nnygh hadde ye more loste than wonne.\"  Whan Gaheries saugh\nhym-self hooll and sounde, and that he was a-gein I-horsed and\ndelyuered, he was right gladde.  Than the bretheren drough\nhem to-geder to relied her peple; and the saisnes blewe hornes\nand trumpes, and armed hem and assembled hem thourgh all the\ncontrey, and ordeyned theire batailes.  But now cesseth a-while\nto speke of thise childeren and of the saisnes, and speke of the\nmen of the contrey that ledde the pray that the childeren hadde\nconquered, and the cariage to the Cite of logres. Here seith the storye that full gladde were the peple of the\ncontrey of the wynnynge that the childeren hadde geten,\nand wente ioyfull and mery with the vitaile, for thei were but\ntwo scottissh myle fro the town, and therfore thei peyned hem\nfaste to come to the Cite saf, for well thei knewe that the saisnes\nwere to moche peple to fight a-geyn the childeren and her feliship;\nand therfore thei douted that the pray sholde be rescued, and\ntake a-gein be strength; and therfor thei hasted to come tymely\nto saf garde.  And whan thei that kepte the Cite saugh come the\nriche pray, thei asked how it was geten.  And thei tolde how\nGawein, the kynges sone loot, and his bretheren, and Galashin,\nthe kynges sone ventre&yogh;, that is cosin to Gawein, be come to\nhelpe the kynge Arthur, and haue lefte theire londes and theire\ncontrey, and sey thei will neuer faile the kynge Arthur while that thei be lyvinge, for thei be come with xxvij felowes, and mette\nwith thre thousande forrayoures that this pray ledden, and foughten\nwith hem till thei haue hem alle slayn and discounfited, and sesed\nvs with the pray to brynge to this Citee saf; and, therfore, open\nthe yates and receyve it in; and after we shull returne hem for\nto socoure, for grete pite it were yef thei were deed or taken in so\ntendre age, for thei ben of high valoure and grete worthynesse. Whan the Cetezeins vndirstode these wordes of the childeren\nthat were come in soche manere, a-noon thei opened the\ngates and receyved hem in to the Citee; and after thei seiden\nthat a parte of hem sholde go helpe the childeren.  Thanne thei\nlete blowe an horn in the maister toure, and than ronne to armes\nthourgh the town.  A-noon they were armed with grete spede,\nand Issed oute at the maister gate.  And than a-bode the Castelein\nof Cardoell, that was a noble man and a trewe.  And whan he\nwas come, he fonde oute of the town vij Ml , and than he seide\n\"Sirs, it were no wisdom to leve the town vn-garnysshed of\npeple, for we knowe not what shall falle ne what peple we\nshall mete.\"  And than \u00feei ansuerde that he seide well, ne\nthei wolde not go but soche as he wolde haue.  Than he toke\noute v Ml , and two thousande he lefte for to kepe the town,\nthat it were not surprised. Than thei rode forth and renged close that wey where as the\nchilderen foughten full sore, ffor the saisnes were mo\nthan vij Ml in a flote.  And as soone as thei hem saugh, thei ne\ndouted nothinge so small a peple that were so ynge.  And ther\nwas of hem but xxiiij knyghtes, and v C squyers, and xx ti that\nwere not yet a-dubbed, and CCC men what on horsebak, and of\nfote-men of peple of the contrei that were falle to hem, and seide\nthei wolde rather be deed than thei wolde forsake her\ncompanye.  But Madelans and Guynehan hadde departed her men in two\npartyes, and eche was iiij Ml , for alle the saisnes were assembled\nto hem two.  Than come Guynehan first with a grete spere, for\nhe was myghty and stronge, and moche oute of mesure, and\nther-to right hardy; and ran vpon hem so fiercely as he\nhymself alone all wolde haue confounded.  And Gawein, that was\nbe-fore his felowes, and heilde an ax trenchaunt, and com a-gein\nhym fiercely.  And Guynehan, that com formest, ran a-gein hym,\nand smote Gawein so harde with his spere that it fley all to peces,\nfor the haubreke was so stronge of dubble maile, and the squyer\nso full of prowesse, that he ne meved not for the stroke, but yaf\nGynehans soche a stroke with his ax vpon the helme that he bente\nouer his horse croupe; and the stroke of the ax glenched, and\nsmote the horse bakke a-sonder, that thei fill to the grounde bothe\nvpon oon heepe.  Whan the saisnes saugh that stroke, thei shodered\na-boute hym, for thei wende that the kynge Guynehan hadde ben\ndeed; and than thei pressed faste to the rescowe.  And Gawein\nsmote amonge hem, and thei smote hym with theire speres and\nslow his horse vnder hym.  And he lepte lightly vpon his feet,\nand yaf so grete strokes that noon durste hym aproche.  Than\ncom the socours on bothe sides, and ther be-gan the bataile a-bowte\nGawein fell and longe lastinge, for the saisnes coueyted to\nremounte Gynehans and for to take Gawein; and his felowes so\nhym defended that it was merveile for to be-holden. Whan Gawein saugh that thei desired so hym to take and\nholde, he griped hys axe and com to a saisne that\nhadde made Agrauayn to stoupe in his sadill, and moche he hym\npayned for to smyten of the heed.  And whan Gawein saugh this he wax ny wode for ire.  Than he threste thourgh the\npresse to that saisne, and for to yeve hym a gret stroke he reysed\nhis ax; and the saisne saugh he myght not voyde the stroke,\nand caste his shelde ther a-geins.  And Gawein hym hitte so\nharde that he slytte the shelde in two partyes.  And the stroke\ndescended on the lifte shulder so grete that he slyt hym to the\ngirdill, and than he fill to grounde.  Than Gawein sesed the\nstede and lepte in to the sadill, and than he cryed to his felowes,\n\"Now shewe youre hardynesse, that these Sarazins not vs ascape,\nand that nother wode ne playn hem shall warante, for ye shall\nse my strokes and my prowesse double.\"  Than he smote the\nstede, and rode in a-monge hem, and made of hem soche martire\nthat thei lay vpon hepes in the feilde, as hey in a medowe; but\nfor all that the saisnes haue horsed Guynehans.  And whan he\nwas remounted a-monge the saisnes, he hente a stronge spere and\na rude, and com to Agrauayn, that hadde his nevewe slayn be-fore\nhys iyen.  And he hitte Agrauayn with his spere so sore that it\npreced two folde thurgh his haubreke, and therto he shof ther-on\nso harde that Agravayn fill to the erthe bothe he and his horse\non an hepe. Whan Gaheries and Galashin saugh Agrauayn falle, thei\nhadde grete drede that he were slayn; and Galashin\ncome formest and smote Guynehans with his swerde vpon the\nhelme, that he made hym enclyne on his sadill bowe; and\nGaheries smote hym with his swerde vpon the arme, that it fly\nin to the feilde; and Gaheriet smote hym be-twene the nekke\nand the shulders as he was stopynge, that he made the heed\nfle in to the playn, and Galashin with his fote spurned his body\nto grounde, and laught the steede, and ledde it to Agravayn that\nsore hym deffended on fote.  And whan Agravayn hadde the\nhorse, he lepte vp as soone as he myght, and than be-gan the\nmeddelynge amonge hem full crewell and fell; but of Gawein\nknewe thei no tidynges, for he was so depe in a-monge the\nsaisnes that it was no light thynge hym for to fynde.  Whan\nthe saisnes sawgh the kynge Gynehans deed, thei were so a-masid\nthat thei wiste not what to do, but turned to flight vpon the bataile of kynge Madelen that was theire chief lorde, and there\nrecouered thei that fledde; and Gawein, that hadde gon here and\nthere, that nothynge cowde here of his bretheryn, and wiste not\nwhether thei were discounfited or noon, he hovid stille till he\nsaugh his felowes comynge, and whan that he knewe it were\nthei, he was gladde; and thei renged hem aboute Gawein, for of\nhym thei hadde be in grete feere.  And Madalen rode with grete\nplente of peple, and were vj Ml , and it ne myght not longe endure\nbut the Gawein sholde haue ben loste, wher-of it hadde ben\ngrete damage and harme to all the londe of logres, but as the\nsocoure com oute of the Citee, and were v Ml men of armes.  Whan\nthe childeren saugh the socour that com oute of logres, and the\nbaner that doo of Cardoell brought, The men of contrey that were\nwith the childeren badde hem be of gode counforte, for \"loo!  heere\ncometh the Citee of logres yow for to helpe and to socoure.\"  Whan\nthe childeren vndirstode that thei of logres were come hem for to\nhelpe thei were gladde and ioyfull.  Than thei refresshed theire\nhorse, and girde hem newe agein, and lepten vp, and hem renged,\nand after rode streyte and close, and the saisness com hem ageins\nfull Irouse and crewell for the deth of Guynehans.  Than thei\nbraste theire speres in theire counterynge vpon sheldes and\nhelmes, and be-gan a bataile full fell and merveillouse, whiche\nmyght not be with-oute grete losse on bothe partyes.  Than com\nin a-monge hem the socour that com out of logres as faste as\ntheire horse myght renne, and ther sholde ye haue herde grete\ncrasinge of speres, and than thei drowgh oute swerdes, and\nbegonne ther a stronge bataile and mortall, ffor ther was shedde so\nmoche blode that it ran like stremes doun the valey. Full grete was the stour and the medle in the playnes be-fore\nlogres of the childeren and the socoure that com oute of\nlogres, and of the saisnes, and dured all the day till it was\nnyght.  Ther dide Gawein soche merveiles in armes that wondirfully was\nhe be-holden of hem of logres, for he smote down men and horse,\nand slow so many, that noon ne durste hym no stroke\na-bide.  Than fill it that he mette with the kynge Madelen, that hadde\nouerthrowe Doo of Cardoell, that was the captein of logres, and heilde hym be the helme at the erthe, and peyned sore hys heede\nof to smyten; and ther-with com Gawein, but ther tho was grete\nstoure and hidouse, for that oon part bisied for the rescew, and\nthe tother hym for to sle or with-holde; but the kynge ther\nmyght thei not take, for he hadde so grete plente of peple; and\nther-with Gawein smote so grete strokes a-monge hem that he\nmade hem alle to disseuer, and it fill so that Madalen com in his\nwey, and he smote hym so with bothe hondes with his axe vpon\nthe helme that he slitte hym to the brayn, and he fell ded to\nthe erthe. Whan the saisnes saugh the kynge Madalen deed, thei were\nso mased that they turned to flight, oon here and a-nother\nthere, and toke the wey to Valdesbires ther the sege lay.  Than\na-roos the duste and the powder so grete that vn-nethe oon myght\nknowe a-nother, ne noon ne a-bode his felowe; but there were\nmany ouerthrown in that chase, for as soone as Doo was\nremounted he hem chased vigerously, but the childeren were euer\nto foren, that made soche martirdom vpon the saisnes, that fyve\nmyle lay the wey full of hem that were wounded and caste to\ngrounde, and thourgh the helpe of god and of hem that come\noute of the Citee, thei slough of hem so many that of xij Ml ne\nascaped not iij Ml that ne were deed or wounded, and thus were\nthe saisnes discounfited, and the chase endured till nyght.  Than\nthei turned gladde and ioyfull to the Citee, where as thei founde\nmerveilouse richesse that thei hadde rescued fro the saisnes of\nthat thei hadde robbed and piled thourgh the londe and the\ncontrey, whiche was all ledde in to the Cite of logres. Whan the childeren were alle come to logres, the Citee made\nof hem grete ioye whan thei hem knewe.  Than thei\nbrought be-fore theym all the riche prise that thei hadde geten,\nand seide vnto Gewein, that thei heilde for the chief lorde, that\nhe sholde it departe at his voluntee; and he ansuerde that he\nwolde ther-of medle in no manere before Doo of Cardoel, \"for,\" he\nseide, \"he can it beter departe and yeve than can I, ffor he\nknoweth beste the pore and the suffretouse, and ther-fore do his\nvolunte.\" Whan the Citezins herde Gawein thus speke, thei hym\ncomended and preysed moche, and seide he myght not\nfaile to be a worthy man; and thei hym loved hertely a-bove alle\nthynge, and preised the grete gentilnesse that thei hym\nfounden.  Thus restede the childeren and soiournede in the Citee of logres,\nthat the saisnes ne dide hem no forfete.  But now cesseth the\nstory of the childeren at this tyme that ne speketh a gret while,\naud returneth to kynge Arthur and kynge ban and kynge boors,\nand her companye, that be gon in to the reame of Tamelide for\nto serue the kynge leodogan.", "13": "CHAPTER XIV. EXPEDITION OF ARTHUR, BAN, AND BOORS TO SUCCOUR LEODOGAN AT TAMELIDE. Right here, seith the frensch booke, that whan the kynge\nArthur was departed fro Bredigan, he and the kynge Ban,\nof benoyk, and the kynge boors of Gannes, his brother, that\nthei rode so her iournes till thei com to Tarsaide, and after to\nTamelide, where as the kynge leodogan soiourned vpon the Pasche\neuen; and whan thei entred into the Citee, Merlin rode with hym\nvpon a grete stede as he that wolde not hym leven in no\nmanere. Than thei com to the paleise, and fonde the kynge leodogan\ngretly affraied, ffor the kynge Ryon was entred his londe vpon\nhym with xv kynges crowned, and hadde hym discounfited and\ndryven oute of the feilde; and thei were loigged at a seige be-fore\na Citee cleped Nablaise, that was a grete town and a riche, and\nplentevouse of alle goodes.  Of this thynge was the kynge leodogan\ngretly a-baisshed and dismayed, ffor his enmyes hadde brought\nvpon hym soche a grete puyssaunce of peple, and he ne kowde\nno counseile how he myght his londe deffende agein the kynge\nRyon, ffor he hadde not peple in his reame sufficient to a-reyse\nhem fro the sege, ne to chase hem oute of his reame, and so ther-of\nhe counseilled with his knyghtes that were with hym be-lefte,\nand asked of hem counseile and her advys. In the while that kynge leodogan toke thus his counseile of his\nknyghtes, entred in the kynge Arthur and his companye\nin to the Paleise, and com be-fore the kynge leodogan, holdynge\neche othir be the honde, two and two to-geder; and the storye seith\nthat with arthur were xl, and hym-self and Merlin made xlij,\nand thei weren alle right wele clothed and richely arrayed, and\nalle yonge bacheleres at pryme barbe, excepte the two kynges that\nyede be-fore, that somdell were in age, and thei were feire knyghtes\nand semely, and thei were be-holden of grete and smale of alle\nthat were ther-Inne, ffor thei were of freissh aray and riche atire;\nand whan thei com be-fore the kynge leodogan, a-noon he a-roos\nand yede hem a-geins, for hym semed thei weren high men and\nof grete astate.  Than spake the kynge ban first, and salued the\nkynge leodogan as soone as he myght, and the kynge seide thei\nwere welcome yef thei come for goode.  \"Certes, sir,\" seide he,\n\"for noon euell ne be we not entred in to youre reame, but we\nbe come to serue yow, with this condicion, that ye desire not to\nknowe oure names in to the tyme that we lete yow wyte of oure\nvoluntee, and but it plese yow in this maner, we commaunde\nyow to god, that he yow deffende from all euell and disese, ffor\nwe shulde fynde I-nowe that vs will resceyve in soche forme as\nwe yow demaunde, but we haue herde sey that ye with-holde\nalle the sowdioures that yow will come.  Now sey vs youre\npleysier.\" Than ansuerde the kynge leodogan that he wolde a-vise hym\nby his counseile, and besekynge hem ther-with not to be\ndisplesed, and thei ansuerde agein to be at his leiser.  Than\ncleped the kynge leodogan the knyghtes of the rounde table, and\nasked how hem semed of that the knyghtes hym demaunded, and\nwhat was her counseile; and thei ansuerde that to with-holde\nhem myght he haue no damage, ffor thei semede to be of grete\nwordynesse, \"and resceyve hem in goddes name, and pray hem as\nsoone as thei may to sey what thei be, and to make hem to be\nknowen.\"  Than departed the kynge fro the counseile, and com\nin to the halle where the barouns hym a-biden, and than he seide\nto hem, \"Feire lordynges, me merveileth gretly of that ye haue me requered, that ye will not that noon knowe what ye be, ne\nwhat be youre names, and of soche thynge herde I neuer speke,\nbut by youre semblaunte ye seme alle worthi men, and therfore\nI will in no wise with-sey that ye requere, and be ye right\nwelcome, and I yow with-holde as my lordes and felowes in soche\nforme that ye shull me ensure to helpe me feithfully and trewly\nwhile that ye be in my companye; but thus moche I will yow\nhertely prayen, that as soone as ye godely mayen, ye will lete me\nwite what ye be; and I shall telle yow wherfore, for ye may be\nsoche that I sholde haue shame that I haue yow not serued as ye\nought for to be, for par-a-uenture ye be of higher astate than\nam I.\"  And thei ansuerde that he ne sholde to hem do nothynge\nbut thei wolde it gladly take in gre; and the kynge Ban hym\ngraunted for to telle her names as soone as tyme requered, and\nthan thei made theire suerte to the kynge leodogan hym trewely\nfor to serue. Than thei departed from the kynge, and wente in to the town\nfor to take the beste loiggynge that thei myght knowe;\nand Merlin hem ledde to the house of a vauasour, that was right\na gode man and a yonge bacheler, and the herberowe was right\ngodely and esy, and the wif was right a noble woman and a feire,\nand goode to god and to the worlde.  The lorde of the house was\na worthy man and of gode livynge, and his name was blaires and\nhis wif leonell; and whan thei com be-fore the place, blaires lepe\noute hem a-geins, and seide thei were welcome, and thei hym\nthankeden.  A-noon thei lighten and yede vp in to the halle that\nwas right feire and welle seyn, and the yomen dight her horses\nwell at ese.  Thus thei soiourned in the town viij dayes full, and\nnothinge dide but ete and dranke and made hem mery, and wente\nto the courte euen and morowe whan thei wolden; and the kynge\nleodogan hem serued and wurshiped in all that he myght, and\nyet he will more whan he knoweth what thei be, he will not\nholde his trauayle nothinge loste; and more-ouer the kynge\nleodogan somowned his peple thourgh-oute his reame, alle tho that\narmes myght bere, that at the ascencion thei sholde be at Toraise\nredy armed hem-self to deffende in bataile a-gein theire enmyes; and alle tho that ne wolde not come, he lete hem well wite that\nthei sholde haue as streyte Iustice as longed to theuis and\ntraytoures; and also the kynge leodogan sente after hys frendes and\nsowdiours ouer all where he myght hem gete for golde or siluer,\nand ther com so grete plente of oon and other, that thei were\nassembled on the ascencion euen in the medowes vndir Toraise,\nand loigged in teyntes and pavilouns, xl Ml , what on horse bakke\nand on fote, with-oute hem that were in the town, where-of ther\nwere vj Ml ; but the story seith that in tho dayes fyve hundred was\ncleped a thousande.  In the tyme that kynge leodogan hadde\nsomowned so his peple, it be-fill on a tewisday, at euen, in the\nentreynge of May, That the kynge Ryolent and the kynge\nPhariouns, of Irelonde, and the kynge Senygres, and the kynge Serans,\nwere departed fro the hoste with xv Ml men of armes, and ran\nthourgh the contrey for vitaile, whereof thei hadde grete nede;\nand it be-fill that thei com wastynge the contrey toward Torayse,\nwhere the kynge leodogan of Tamelide soiourned, and a-bode his\npeple that he hadde sente after.  Than herde the kynge the noyse\nof hem that gadered to-geder the pray, and robbed the londe and\nthe contrey a-boute Torayse, and thei of the town hem perceyved,\nand than thei closed the yates, and the knyghtes that were\nwith-ynne at soiourne ronne to theire armes and lepe to theire horse,\nand assembled hem to-geder with-ynne the yates.  Than were\nalle the knyghtes of the rounde table armed, and the gouernaunce\nof hem hadde hervy the Rivell and males ly bruns, and thei were\ntwo hundred and fifty that alle were noble gode knyghtes and trewe,\nand were so worthi in armes, that vndir sonne men myght fynde\nnoon better: these were alle in a wynge by hem-self, for thei\nwolde not be medled a-monge noon other; and on the tother side\nside the knyghtes and the peple of the Citee arayed hem, and\nthei were iiij Ml , and of these hadde the stiward the gouernaunce\nhem to lede, that was cleped Cleodalis.  This cleodalis was wonte\nto bere the chief baner of the kynge, but euer after that the\nknyghtes of the rounde table were come, hervy the Rivell it bar;\nbut he bar a smal ganfanon of two smale losenges of goules, and\nthe feelde of golde and crownes of ynde; and the grete baner that hervy bar was of iiij losenges full of crownes of golde.  Whan thei\nwere well armed, thei renged hem be-fore the portes, and a-bode\nthe comaundement of the kynge; and whan the kynge was armed,\nhe lepe on a grete stede of greet bounte, and rode to the baner\nthat hervy bar, and ther he hoved still till thei saugh come the\nsarazins, and were mo than vij Ml on horsebak. And on the tother side was arthur well armed, and alle his\nhis companye, and thei were alle richely horsed.  And\nMerlin bar that day the baner, and he comaunded hem alle, that\nas dere as thei heilden her owen bodies, that thei sholde sue that\nbaner all that day in what place that it yede; and thei seide alle\nthat thei so wolden.  Than thei set forth her wey thourgh the\ntown, so fresch and richely armed that no peple might be better,\nand thei were xlj, with-oute Merlin that bar the baner, soche oon\nthat for a grete merveile was be-holden of oon and other that\nday, for he bar a dragon that was not right grete, and the taile\nwas a fadome and an half of lengthe tortue, and he hadde a wide\nthrote that the tounge semed braulinge euer, and it semed sparkles\nof fier that sprongen vp in to the heire out of his throte.  With\nthat com Geauntes, and the Sarazins, and smote theire speres vpon\nthe yates of the town, and after turned down the medowes, for\nthei fonde no man that yaf hem ansuere, and gadered to-geder\nalle the prayes of bestes that were in the medowes.  And Merlin\neschuwed alle that were in the stretes of the town, and rode\nthourgh hem euen to the yates with his meyne, and seide than\nto the porter, \"Lete oute, for it is tyme;\" and the porter seide\nthei sholde not oute of the yates till the kynge hadde\ncomaunded.  \"What,\" seide Merlin, \"makeste thow daunger of that I haue\nas grete power as thow.\"  Than Merlin caught the flayle of the\nyate and plukked it to hym and yede oute as lightly as it hadde\nnot haue ben lokked, and than departed oute magre how it\ngrucchid.  Whan these xlij felowes weren oute of the town, than\nthe gate was as close as it hadde neuer be opened at that tyme,\nand of that merveile blissid the kynge ban and the kynge boors\nhis brother, and alle the tother.  And Merlin priked faste his\nhorse till he ouer-toke a grete company of sarazins that were two thousande or mo, that ledde grete plente of beestes, and Merlin\nfrusht a-monge hem with his banere, and his companye with hym,\nand leyde on sore strokes, and in her metynge ouer-threw alle that\nthei countred, and in lesse than an hour thei hadde hem so slayn\nand chased, that thei toke the pray and ledde it to the gates of\nthe town; but thei hadde gon but a-while when thei saugh iiij\nkynges com with xv thousande men of armes, that ledde so grete\ncariage of robbery that thei hadde piled thourgh the contrey, and\nwere towarde the see.  Whan Merlin hem saugh, he seide to his\nfelowes, \"Suweth me,\" and thei so diden; and it fill so that\na-noon, as Merlin hadde caste a charme, there rose soche a wynde\nand storme so grete, that the powder and the duste a-rose with\nthe wynde, and smote in the visages of the Geauntes and sarazins,\nthat oon myght not right wele knowe a-nother. And a-noon as the xlij felowes were in a-monge hem, thei\nslowe and ouerthrewe so many that it was wonder to\nthinke; and than comaunded the kynge leodogan to open the\nyates.  Than Issed oute first the stiwarde Cleodales formeste (with iiij Ml men of armes), and fonde the yate close where as thei yssed oute,\nthat foughten agein xv Ml men so harde that it was merveile.  Than\ncom Cleodalis with his banere, and smote in a-monge the presse right\nhidously; ther sholde ye haue herde grete brekinge of speres, and\ngrete noyse of swerdes vpon helmes and vpon sheldes, that the\nsownde was herde in to the Citee clerly; ther was grete defoulinge\nof men and horse; but there the xlij felowes shewed merveiles\nwith her bodies. Whan these iiij kynges saugh that these were a-monge hem\nmedelinge, thei departed her peple in tweyne, and lefte\nviij Ml fighting stille; and vij Ml rode a-gein the banere of kynge\nleodogan that thei saugh come oute of the town, and the ton rode a-gein\nthe tother full fercely; and whan thei neighed nygh, thei lowed ther\nsperes, and yaf to-geder so grete strokes vpon sheldes, that thei\nperced haubrekes, and dismailed, and many ther were throwen to\ngrounde sore bledynge with stroke of speres, and many ther were\nthat passed thourgh with-oute fallinge.  Whan the speres were\nbroken, thei leide honde to swerdes, and be-gonne the bataile grete and merveilouse; but ther sholde ye haue seyn the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table do wondres, and thei were but CC and fifty, and\nthei that were fightinge with hem were vij Ml , and so were the\nknyghtes of the rounde table at gret myschief, for thei be-hoved\nto disparble, whethir thei wolde or noon, and voyde the place;\nbut thei heilde hem to-geder so close and streite, that noon myght\nhem perce ne entyr in amonge hem.  Whan the kynge Riolent\nand the kynge placiens saugh that so litill a peple withstode so\ngrete a power as thei were, thei hadde ther-of grete merveile and\ngrete dispyte; than thei cried theire ensigne, and swore that\nneuer oon of hem sholde ascape.  Than thei yaf hem a grete shoure\nand a felonouse, for at that shofte thei ouerthrewe mo than xl,\nand moche thei hem peyned hem to diffoule and to maymen, but her\nfelowes were vpon hem arrestynge, and hem deffended from theire\nenmyes with her swerdes with all theire myght; and than it fill\nthat the kynge leodogan was throwen fro his horse full lothly,\nand thei token hym with strengthe and ledde hym toward prison,\nwith moo than v C , in to the hoste of kynge Rion of Irlonde, and\nthei hym ledde full fiercely, for thei wende wele that alle here\nwerre hadde be fynysshed.  And so thei ledde the kynge leodogan in\nalle the haste that thei myght, and whan the kynge leodogan\nsaugh hym so mysfallen, and that his enmyes hadde hym taken,\nhe sowowned often tymes and made grete sorowe; and thei that\nhym ledden spedden hem so faste that thei were fro the town two\nmyle.  Full grete was the noyse of the vij Ml and the\nCC l. knyghtes of the rounde table that were full hevy and wroth for\nthe kynge that thei hadde loste, and than seide a-monge hem and\nassured to-geder seth it was com ther-to, and that thei saugh all\nsholde be loste, than thei wolde avenge her shame and deth as\nlonge as they myght lyven.  Than thei sette her bakkes eche to\nother, and hem deffended merveilously, and made soche slaughter\nof men and horse a-boute hem with-oute remevynge oute of place,\nand so moche peyne and traueile thei suffred, that thei that were\nat the wyndowes of the palise that saugh the merveile wepte for\npite; and Gonnore, the doughter of kynge leodogan, whan she\nsaugh her fader ledde a-monge his enmyes, she made so gret sorowe that nygh she slowe hir-self for doell.  But now lete vs\ncesse to speke of hem till tyme cometh a-gein, and speke of the\nkynge Arthur and his felowes, how that thei haue spedde in the\nbataile a-gein the viij thousande with the stiwarde Cleodalis of\nTamelide. Now, seith the storie, that stronge and crewell was the stour\nther as the bateile was, where as the xlij felowes and the\niiij Ml that were with Cleodalis, the stiwarde, that foughten a-gein\nviij Ml Sarazins; and many ther were slayn that lay grennynge on\nthe grounde.  And whan thei hadde longe tyme fought to-geder,\nMerlin rode a grete walop oute of the bataile, and cried to his\nfelowes that thei sholde sue hym, and thei so dide in grete haste,\nand rode as faste as the horse myght hem bere, till that thei were\npassed all theire peple, and than thei encresed her pas gretter, and\nrode towarde the siege the right wey ther as the Geauntes and\nthe sarazins were, till that thei come in a valey that was right\ndepe, and ther thei ouer-toke the v C sarasins that ledde the kynge\nleodogan; and as soone as Merlin hym saugh, he cried, \"Now\nlordinges, vpon hem, for ye be by-trayed and deed yef eny of\nof hem ascape.\"  Than thei drive in a-monge hem as tempest of\nthunder, and kilde and slough all that thei raught a right stroke\nin her comynge, and ther ne was noon of the xlj but he slowe or\nmaymed whom that he mette.  Ther sholde ye haue seyn soche\nmartirdom, and soche slaughter of men and of horse, that noon ne\nmyght ascape, so were thei supprised and a-stonyed, saf oonly\nfyve that ascaped, fleinge thei rought neuer what wey.  Thus\nhaue thei rescowed the kynge leodogan; and whan the kynge\nsaugh the grete martire and the occision that so fewe peple hadde\ndon a-gein so many, he merveyled gretly what thei myght be;\nthan he be-heilde and knewe it was the dragon that Merlyn\nbar.  Than knewe he wele that it were the sowdiours that he hadde\nwith-holden, and than he thanked god of the socoure that he hadde\nhym sente.  Than com Merlin to hym, and than he rested; whan\nsaugh the kynge leodogan bounden he alight, and so dide Bretell,\nand hym vn-bounden, and right his armoure, and sethen made\nhym to lepe on a steede that was stronge and swyfht; and the kynge hem thonkeden hertely of the servise thei hadde hym\ndon.  Than cried Merlin, \"Gentill knyghtes, what tarye ye heere\nso long?  suweth me!\"  Than he rode a grete raundon towarde the\ntown, where the knyghtes of the rounde table were at gret myschief,\nthat of CC l. ne were but xx ti on horsebak, but deffended hem on\nfote as wilde bores; and Merlin bar the baner be-fore, and rode as\nfaste as he myght, and his felowes also, that theire horses swetten;\nand the dragon that Merlin bar caste oute gret flames of fiere,\nthat it sparkeled vp in the ayre, that thei vpon the walles of the\ntown saugh the clernesse of the light half a myle longe.  Whan\nthei of Citee saugh the kynge that was her lorde, and saugh it\nwere the xlij felowes, and with hem the kynge leodogan that\nthei hadde rescued, thei hadde grete ioye; and whan Gonnore\nthis saugh, she spronge for ioye, and merveiled what the knyghtes\nwere that com in that company; and thei com as faste as thunder\nso harde a-monge her enmyes, and in her comynge ech threwe\noone to grounde; and as soone as the xlij felowes were smyten\nin a-monge hem, ther be-gan a grete bataile, and soche slaughter\nof men and horse, that the maiden that was lenynge oute at the\nwyndowes of the paleise herde the grete strokes.  Ther yaf the\nkynge ban, of Benoyk, many strokes with corchense, his gode\nswerde, ffor whom he a-rafte a full stroke, ther waranted hym\nneither shelde, ne haubreke, ne noon armure, that he kutte all\nthourgh-oute at oon stroke, and many sithes he smote bothe horse\nand man to grounde at a stroke, and so dide hys brother, the\nkynge Boors, of gannes.  And the sarazins hem be-heilde for grete\nmerveile that thei saugh hem do; and the kynge Arthur dide\nsoche merveiles with Calibourne, his gode swerde, ffor ther a-gein\nmyght noon armure endure, were it neuer so stronge, ffor what\nhe a-raught was at his endynge for euer. Grete was the bataile be-fore the town of Toraise ther as the\nCC l. knyghtes of the rounde table and the xlij felowes foughten agein the sarazins; but thei haue so foughten that of\nvij Ml beth lefte but v Ml , wherfore thei beth sory and wroth for the\nkynge Canlent that thei haue loste; and than fill it so that the kynge\nban mette with kynge Clarion, that was the moste man of the hoste of alle the Geauntes; and the storye seith that the kynge\nban was a moche knyght of body, and a stronge, and coragous\nand hardy.  The kynge heilde corchense, his gode suerde, and\nsmote the kynge Clarion so sore vpon the helme that he slit it\ndowon to the eere, the stroke fill vpon the lifte shulder, that he\nslitte hym to the girdell; and the kynge Boors so smote Sarmedon,\nthe ganfanoner, that he kutte of the arme with all the sheilde,\nand the baner fill to the erthe.  This stroke saugh the kynge\nleodogan, and seide, \"Now be there no knyghtes but these that\nso well conne helpe at nede.\"  And whan the Geauntes saugh\ntheire lorde deed, and her baner fallen, thei turned to flight, oon\nhere another there; and than com oute of the town knyghtes and\nsergeauntes two thousande, and be-gonne the chase vpon hem that\nturned to flight; but Merlin turned not that wey as thei fledde,\nbut wente to the bataile ther as Cleodalis faught fercely with\niiij Ml men a-gein viij Ml .  Whan Merlin com to the bataile, he fonde\nCleodalis was on fote fightinge, and heilde yet the baner vp right,\nand his men a-boute hym renged, that well hym deffended as\nworthy men; but thei were at grete myscheif, and in poynte to\nhaue hadde grete losse in short tyme, whan Merlin com drivinge\namonge hem with his dragon and his xlj felowes, of whiche ye\nhaue herde that in her comynge ferde as tempeste, and ther-to\nthei were alle so well horsed that no men myght be better, and\nthe kynge leodogan was euer with hem that in no wise wolde\nhem leten; and whan these xlij felowes were in a-monge the\nGeauntes ther was soche marteleise and soche noise as so many\nCarpenteres in a wode.  Ther was stronge stour and fell and\ndolerouse, for ther sholde ye haue sein knyghtes and sergeauntes falle as thikke as it hadde be reyn: ther sholde ye se stedes and\nhorse renne maisterles, their reynes trailynge vndir fote, wher-of\nthe sadeles were all blody of knyghtes that ther-ynne hadde be\nslayn: ther sholde ye haue herde soche bruyt and soche noyse\nand cry that it was merveile and grete doell to here.  Ther dide\nthe xlij felowes so well that it was spoken of longe tyme after\nher deth in that contrey; and the storye seith thei mangled and\nslow so many, that by the traces oon myght haue sued half a day euery wey of the deed bodies and horse that thei hadde wounded,\nas thei that nought ne cessed ne rested; and therfore me semeth\nreson to reherse the names of tho worthi men. The first was kynge Ban of benoyk, and the seconde was\nkynge Boors of Gannes, and the thirde was kynge Arthur,\nand the forthe was Antor, the v e was Vlfin, the vj e Bretell, the\nvij e was kay, the viij lucas the botiller, the ix e was Gifflet, the\nx e maret de la roche, the xj drias de la forest sauage, the xij\nbelias de amerous of maydons castell, the xiij e flaundryns le bret,\nthe xiiij ladynas de benoyk, the xv amoret le brun, the xvj\nAnticolas le rous, the xvij blois del casset, the xviij blioberis,\nthe xix Canade, the xx Meliadus le bloys, the xxj Aladan the\ncrespes, the xxij Placidas ly gays, the xxiij leonpadys of the\nplayn, the xxiiij Ierohas lenches, the xxv Christofer de la roche\nbyse, the xxvj Ayglin de vans, the xxvij Calogreuaunt, the\nxxviij Aguysale de desirouse, the xxix Agresianx, the nevew of\nthe wise lady of the foreste with-oute returne, the xxx Chalis\nthe orphenyn, the xxxj Grires de lambal, the xxxij kehedin de\nbelly, the xxxiij Meranges de porlenges, the xxxiiij Gosnayns\ncadrus, the xxxv Clarias of Gaule, the xxxvj the lays hardy, the\nxxxvij Anmadius the proude, the xxxvij Osenayn cors hardy,\nxxxix Galescowde, xl Gales, the xlj bleoris the sone of kynge\nBoors, the xlij was Merlin, and the xliij was the kynge leodogan\nthat in no wise wolde hem leve.  These xliij worthi knyghtes\nwente to the rescew of Cleodalis, the stiwarde of Tamelide, that\nwas a noble knyght, and right trewe, and full of grete hardynesse,\nand well it shewde that for noon vnkyndenesse that the kynge\nleodogan hadde don a-gein hym he wolde hym not forsake, ne\nleve hym in his myscheif in no nede that he was in, but\ntherynne he dide moche more than many other wolde haue don, and\nI shall sey yow the cause why.  This was the troweth, that the\nkynge leodogan hadde a wif, a lady of grete bewte and of high\nlynage, and whan he hadde brought here in to Tamelide out of\nher fader londe, after that he hadde her wedded, this lady brought\nwith hire a mayden that was of grete bewte.  This maiden loved\nthe stiward so moche that on a day he asked hir of the kynge leodogan for to haue her to his wif, that many a day hadde hym\nserued, and the kynge hym graunted for his gode servise; and\nwhan thei were maried and she satte at the table a-monge other\nladyes, and she was richely arayed, the kynge liked moche hir\nbewte, and soche a fantasie fill in his herte that he cowde not it\nremeve, and he hym covered in the beste maner that he cowde,\nand she was with-oute faile oon of the feirest of the worlde; till\nit fill on a feste of seint Iohn that the kynge sente Cleodalis vpon\na iourney a-gein the saisnes that vpon hym werred that tyme,\nand the lady that was lefte with the quene for companye, that\nmoche her lovid with grete love, hit fill on a nyght that the\nkynge leodogan lay by the quene, and that nyght vpon hir he\nbegat a doughter, that was cleped Gonnore whan she was\nbaptised, the whiche after was of merveilouse bewte and the wif of\nkynge Arthur; and this lady that was wif to kynge lodogan was\na goode lady and holy of livinge, and hadde an vsage to a-rise on\nnyghtes and go to chirche to sey matyns and to heere all seruyse\nto messe.  That nyght that the quene hadde conceyved Gonnore\nher doughter, she yede to matyns, and com by the stiwardes wif,\nand fonde her slepynge and wolde not her a-wake, but wente and\nlefte her lyinge a-slepe, and wente forth a-lone to the cherche,\nthat was faste by, with hir sawter in her hande; and the kynge,\nthat longe had desired to speke with that lady, a-rose as soone as\nthe quene was gon, and dide oute the taperes that were\nbrennynge, and than wente to ly by the stiwardes wif, and whan the\nlady felte oon lyinge by her, she asked what he was, all affraied;\nand than he ansuerde how it was he, and bad hir be stille, and\nseide yef she made eny noyse she sholde be deed.  The lady her\ndeffended I-nowgh as with speche, but she durste not crye ne\nmake no noyse; but litill a-vailed her defense, for the kynge by\nhir lay, and on hir he gat a doughter the same nyght that he\nhad geten Gonnore on his wife.  And whan the quene was\ndelyuered ther was founde vpon the childes reynes a litill crosse\nlike a crowne for a kynge; and as soone as the quene was\ndelyuered, the stiwardes wif be-gan to traueyle, and hadde a\ndoughter of feire bewte, and was so like the quenes doughter, that oon cowde not knowe oon from a-nother but by the crosse\nvpon her reynes, and eche of hem hight Gonnere in bapteme, and\nwere norrisshed and brought vp to-geder till that the quene was\ndeed; and the kynge yet was not keled of the love of the\nstiwardes wif, and he her toke and shet her in a Castell, for he\nwolde not the stiwarde sholde speke with hir.  In soche maner\nhe heilde her more than v yere, till that the stiwardes frendes\nspake vn-to hym, and he seide he wolde not faile the kynge\nwhile he hadde werre, and yet the same tyme that kynge Arthur\ncom for to serue, he hir heilde in the selue maner, and yet for all\nthis the stiwarde neuer feyned to serue.  But now lete vs retourne\nto speke of the stiwarde ther he is fightynge on fote amonge the\nGyauntes, for all be tyme we shull speke of the twey Gonnores\nwhan the mater fallith ther-to. Now, seith the storye, that grete was the bataile, and\nmortall, ther as the stiward Cleodalis was on fote\na-monge the Geauntes and the saisnes, and as soone as the xlij\nfellowes were entred a-monge hem, thei disparbelid the renges\nharde; ther myght ye se oon fall deed after a-nothir as thikke as\nhaile, and many a stede renne thourgh the feilde at the rescewe\nof the stiwarde, for ther was many a grete stroke yoven that\nmade many a gentill lady to wepe for her bretheren and for her\nchilderen, but magre hirs thei were driven bakke.  Whan\nSonygrenx and Sorfrains saugh the damage and the grete occision that\nso litill a peple dide, thei toke it in grete dispite.  Than thei\nblewe theire trumpes and theire tymberes to assemble theire\npeple, and Sonygrenx restreyned his peple a-boute hym, and as\nhe hadde hem assembled a-boute hym, kay the stiwarde, and\nlucas the boteller, and Gifflet, hem renged, and smyten in a-monge\nhem, and eche of hem griped a stronge spere, and kay smote\nsonygrenx so that he fill from his horse that he lay a starke while\nwith-oute sterynge of hande or foote, and lucas and Gefflet smote\ndown othir towe deed.  Whan the saisnes saugh Sonygrenx at\nerthe, thei shoff to the rescewe, and the xlij felowes sterten a-boute\nhym with swerdes drawen, and the saisnes pressed to releve the\nkynge Sonygrenx, but the xlij felowes hem deffended so that thei myght hym not nyegh, and so was he foule troden vndir horse\nfeete er he myght be remounted, ffor the grete presse of saisnes\nwere ther assembled.  And Merlin that bar the baner come to\nsocoure the thre felowes that I haue named, that right soone elles\nmyght haue hadde damage.  Here assembled agein all the\nturnement, and Cleodalis was horsed vpon a grey steede, and he yet\nheilde the kynges baner stille.  Than he cryde his ensigne fierscely\nand rode in to the presse, he and his men, as faste as the horse\nmyght renne; and ther was than merveilouse stour and harde,\nfor than ther sholde ye see many a knyght ly ded vnder the horse\nfeet; but the saisnes were so many that they myght not be perced\nlightly thourgh, but stode stiffly a-gein the crysten.  Than fill it\nso that the vij Ml that were discounfited be-fore Torayse fill to the\npeple of Sonygrenx and Sorfrain, and ther a-bode all tho that\nfledden so thikke that thei putte the cristen bakke more than the\ndraught of an arblast; but the xlij felowes ne remeved neuer\na foote londe fro the place, and ther Sonygrenx was vn-horsed, but\nwith grete peyne was Sonygrenx remounted, that foule and\ndispitously was diffouled vnder horse feet, and than was the stour\nrenewed, for sore he hym peyned to a-venge the same that he\nhadde resceyved, and ran vpon the cristen, he and his men, and\nsmote hem sore with swerdes and speres, and enclosed hem rounde\na-boute.  Than Merlin smote in to the presse vigerously with the\nbaner in his honde, and the knyghtes of the rounde table, that\nwere remounted and newe araide, com to that medle a softe pase\nstreite and clos, and whan thei saugh be-fore hem the signe of\nthe dragon that Merlin bar, thei dressed that wey, for wele\nhadde thei ther-by be socoured ther thei were in grete a-venture\nof deth. Whan the knyghtes of the rounde table approched the bataile\nthei sprongen in a-monge hem so felly, that thei bare\ndown all that thei mette in her comynge, and whan the speres\nwere broken thei drough oute theire swerdes and be-gonne the\nstour all newe fresshly and full fiercely; and on the tother side\nfaught Cleodalis and his men full strongely, but for power that\nthei hadde thei myght holde no grounde, ffor the kynge fforfrain ledde hem felonously towarde the town, and fro the town com\nhem to helpe two thousande of hem that hadde chased theym\nthat fledde; and whan thei saugh the baner of stiwarde, and the\ngret peple that hem suwed, they turned that wey, and sette so\nfiercely vpon hem, that moo than a thousande thei leid to the\nerthe in her comynge; and tho a-bode the peple of Cloedalis, and\nkepte her grounde, and be-gonne a-gein the stour so grete, that\nhalf a myle of men myght heere the noyse; and so thei heilde\ngrete while the ton agein the tother, and that was a-gein the\nkynge Sofarin that hadde moo than viij Ml , a-gein Cleodalis that\nhadde ner vj M l, and than thei heilde hem well peringall. And on the tother side faught the knyghtes of the rounde\ntable right sore, and the xlij felowes, a-gein Sonygrenx\nand his men that were vj Ml , and so thei were at grete myscheif,\nfor thei were but CCC saf viij, and the sarazins were moo than\niiij Ml ; and than Merlin cleped the kynge Ban, and seide to alle\nthe tother, \"Sirs, wher-after a-byde ye that ye ne put hem to\ndisconfiture?\" and thei ansuerde, \"How?\"  \"Sirs, I shall telle\nyow,\" quod Merlin; \"ther be but v Geauntes in the place that\nall this sustene, and yef ye may delyuer of hem thre, the place\na-noon shalbe voyde.\"  \"Wher be thei, sir?\" seide the kynge\nBan.  \"Trewly,\" quod Merlin, \"Vlfin and Bretell and Gifflet\nand kay and lucas the boteller be with hem medelinge, and\ntherfore folowe after me, for a-noon shull we se who shall do beste\nof this companye.\"  Than smote Merlin the horse with the spores\nthat swyftly hym bar, and smote in to the medle that was right\ngrete of fyve knyghtes a-gein x Geauntes grete and stronge out of\nmesure; and the kynge Ban, that was an huge knyght and an\nhardy and a stronge, com formest of alle, and fill hym wele that\nhe mette first with the kynge Sonygrenx, and the kynge Ban\ngript his swerde, that was all be-soyled with blode and brayn,\nand hitte Sonygrenx on the helme of stele, and in the swarvinge,\nthe stroke, that was grete, descended be-twene the shelde, and\nkutte a-sonder the gyge with all honde that it fly in to the\nfeilde; and whan Sonygrenx saugh hym so araide, a-noon he turned\nto flight, and caste a grete brayt and an orible, and wente makinge grete sorowe.  And the kynge Arthur hitte Margalyuaunt thourgh\nthe helme euen down to the teth; and the kynge Boors smote\nso Seleuaunt that he slitte a quarter of his helme, the swerde\nglenched vpon the lifte shulder and smote it clene a-sonder, and\nhe fill to grounde; and Vlfin smote so balan that he fill to\ngrounde all blody, and Bretell smote also down Cordaunt, and\nkay dandevart, and lucas smote Malet, and Gifflet mynadap, and\nmerangis slow Saduc, and Gosenaym slow doulas; and as soone\nas the saisnes saugh these down, thei were so dismayed, that of\na grete space thei meved not, and seide to hem-self that grete\nfoly it were to fight with hem lenger but yef he wolde be\nslayn, ffor thei seide \"these be no peple like other men, but it be fendes of helle, for a-gein her strokes may noon armoure\nendure.\" Whan the knyghtes of the rounde table and the xlij felowes\nsaugh the saisnes that thei were so a-baisshed, thei hem\nslowen and mangeled, and yaf hem a fressh a-sawte as faste as\nthe horse myght hem bere, till that thei were smeten in to the\nmedle that kynge Sorfarins faught a-gein Cleodalis the stiwarde,\nand thise rode in a-monge them so fiercely, that thei made hem\nalle to remeve oute of the place; ne neuer thei stynte till they\ncome be-fore the yates of Toraise.  Thus were thei of the town\ngretly affraide whan thei saugh not the baner of kynge leodogan,\nand therfore thei supposed he was other taken or deed, and also\nthei ne saugh not the dragon that the Sowdiours bar, and that hem\nfered gretly, ffor now thei wende wele that all hadde be loste,\nfor thei saugh hir enmyes be-fore the town, and grete drede thei\nhadde lest that thei hadde hem discounfited; but thei myght\nnot, for thei were at grete myschef, for thei were but vij Ml and\nthe saisnes were viij Ml , and on the tother side thei were so\naffraide for the knyghtes of the rounde table, and for the xlij\nfelowes of whom thei herde no tydinges; and these fledde till thei\ncome be-fore the yate; ther thei stynte be-fore the brigge and\nhem renge, and these other come vpon hem that right straytly hem required, here was than a merveilouse stour and mortall, and\nlonge it endured; and wite ye well that a thousande ther were\nouer-throwe that neuer hadde power to a-ryse. But as soone as the sowdiours were come, and the knyghtes\nof the rounde table, the peple of Sonygrenx were\ndiscounfited; but thei wolde not hem enchase, for Merlin hem\nwith-heilde, and drough hem a-parte in to the feilde, and seide,\n\"Feire lordinges, now lete hem gon, and besye ye not hem to\nenchase, ffor ther-to shall come tyme here-after; but drawe yow\na litill a-bakke, and a-light down on fote, and drawe to-geder\nyowre peple, and refresshe yowre horse, and lete hem reste, and\nthan girdeth hem newe a-gein;\" and thei dide his\ncounseile.  And whan the knyghtes of the rounde table saugh hem a-bide,\nthan seide hervy de ryuell that he wolde go be-fore\ntheym.  Than thei a-light, and araide hem right wele, and hem refresshed\nas thei that ther-to hadde grete nede.  And the kynge leodogan\ncom to Merlin, and seide, \"Sir, will ye not that these worthy\nmen come in youre companye?\"  \"Certes,\" seide Merlin, \"sir,\nwe will right wele, and \u00feei be right welcome, for we be the\nbetter that thei be with vs in felisship.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge,\n\"gramercy.\"  Than yede the kynge leodogan to hervy de rivell,\nthat bar the baner, and seide, \"Feire frende, come ye and youre\nfelowes with me, and ye shull be in feliship of these worthi\nmen, and so moche shull ye be the more worthy.\"  \"Sir,\" seide\nhervy, \"with right gode will yef it hem plese.\"  \"Certes,\"\nseide the kynge, \"it hem lyketh wele that ye be fro hens-forth\nfelowes and in companye to-geder.\"  \"In goddes name,\" quod\nhervy, \"for the feliship of so worthi men is not to be\nrefused.\"  Than thei lepe to horse, and gedered to-geder on a soppe; and\nthan Merlin toke firste the wey; and thei alle hym folowen\nwheder that euer he rode.  And as thei rode in this wise as ye\nhaue herde, Cleodalis, the stiwarde, faught with vj Ml men a-gein\nSoffarin, that hadde in his companye moo than x Ml ; but thei\nwere not well sette in rule, but schoved heir and there where as thei semed beste to sette here strokes.  And so the peple of\nCleodalis were moche greved, for thei were at grete myschief, and\nhadde so moche suffred that nere thei were turned to the flight;\nbut whan thei saugh come the dragon that Merlin bar, that caste\noute of his throte so grete raundon of fiere in to the aire, that\nwas full of duste and powder, so that it semed all reade.  And\nwhan the ladies vpon the walles this saugh, thei cryed alle with\noon voys, \"Now, sir Cleodalis, haue mynde to do well, and\nbe-holde towarde the valey, and se the socour that cometh.\" Whan Cleodalis vndirstode that the ladies seiden, he\nbe-heilde and saugh that he hadde so moche desired.  And\nwhan the knyghtes that were with Cleodalis saugh this socour,\nit nedeth not to aske yef thei be gladde and ioyfull.  Than\nCleodalis dide renne to the saisnes, bothe he and his peple, for to\nlete hem vndirstonde that thei hadde counfort; and be-gonne\nfreshly vpon hem as it hadde be at the comencement.  And these\nother com ridinge a softe pase till thei com as nygh as the caste\nof a ston.  And than thei ffrusshed in so rudely that thei threwe\nCCC at the firste shoffe in theire comynge; and many ther were\nthat neuer roos after.  And than thei plonged in a-monge hem so\ndepe, and neuer thei stynted till thei come to the baner of Cleodalis. And whan thei were there alle assembled, than cryed Merlin,\n\"Lordinges!  worthy knyghtes!  now let see youre\ncheualrye, for now be ye come to the assay.\"  whan the kynge\nArthur vndirstode the wordis of Merlin, he seide to kynge Boors\nand to kynge Ban, laughinge, that neuer hadde ther be so fyn an\nolde man.  And Merlin ther-with cried, \"Lete be your Iapes,\nfor all this woke more ye shull haue leiser to laugh and to\npley.\"  And whan thei herde hym sey so, thei rode in a-monge theire\nenmyes wroth and matelentif; ther was tho a merveilouse stour\nand creuwell, and encresed more and more than it hadde do all\nthe day be-fore.  Ther dide the kynge Arthur wonderes, for as\nthe boke seith, so he labored by the entycement of Merlin, that\nall peple hym be-heilde for the merveile.  And Gonnore, the\ndoughtere of kynge leodegan, and the ladyes and the maydenes,\nheilde vp here hondes a-gein heuene, and praied god to deffende hym fro deth and pereile, and wepten for pitee of the traueyle\nthat thei suffred; and ther-to thei merveillede that so yonge a\nman myght that endure, and namely the kynge Arthur more\nthan eny other, for he smote with Calibourne his gode swerde on\neuery side; for he smote of handes, and armes, and heedes, and\nthyes; and he smote down knyghtes, and horse, and men; he\nmade sheeldes shiver fro nekkes, and helmes from hedes, that the\nserkeles fly a-sonder, and hadde euer goode wardeyns a-boute\nhym, that gretly hym helped in eche nede; for full noble men\nwere the two kynges that ben in his companye, ffor a-geyns hem\nmyght noon armoure endure, ne presse, were it neuer so grete,\nbut that thei it brake with trenchaunt swerdes; and so dide wele\nthoo prise knyghtes in her companye, and also the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table, that ne ought not to be for-yeten.  Ffull harde\nand stronge bataile was be-fore the yates of Toraise, and many\nfeire chivalryes shewed on the oo parte and on the tother, and\ndured all the day, and was so nygh the walles of the town that a\nman myght haue caste a ston a-monge hem vpon here helmes. Whan sorfarin saugh how he hadde so moche loste of his\npeple, he swore by his creaunce that he wolde neuer\ndeparte thens till he hadde done hem as grete damage.  Than he\ncalled Sortebran, and Clarion, and Gaidon, and Senebant, and\nmalore, and ffreelant, alle these were his kynnes-men, and bolde\nknyghtes and hardy, and than he seide to hem, \"Now be it sene who\nis a knyght.\"  Than soche ix knyghtes that were grete and huge,\nran in a-monge the cristen as faste as the horse myght hem bere,\nand Sorfarin smote hervy the rivell so rudely that he fill of his\nhorse to grounde, and after he smote Antor that he fill to the\nerthe, bothe he and his horse on an hepe, and after he smote\nGifflet thourgh the side that he fill to the erthe wounded all\nblody, and eche of his felowes bar oon to the grounde, but ther\nnas noon that was wounded to deth; and of these that fellen\nwas lucas the botiller, that oon, and Meranges a-nother, and\nGosnayns Cardus, and Grires de lamball, and Gosnayn de strangot,\nand the ixe was Bretell, and alle these fill by stroke of spere for\ndefaute of horse.  Than a-rose a grete showte, and the duste so thikke that vnethe myght oon see a-nother, for the saisnes rested\nalle vpon hem, that gretly hem peyned hem for to slee; but thei\nwere delyuer and hardy and lepten vp on foote, and theire swerdes\nnaked in theire hondes, and deffended hem right harde, but thei\nwere so many and so thikke, and ther-to sought vpon hem so\nstraitely; but litill it hem a-vailed whan Merlin com to socoure,\nand the baner in his honde; and Sorfarin, that moche hym peyned\nhem to do damage, smote so the kynge leodogan thourgh the\nshelde, and he bar his spere so lowe that he hurte hym in the\nflanke, and to grounde yede bothe the kynge and his horse, the\ntoon vpon the tother.  And when thei in the town saugh the\nkynge falle, thei hadde grete drede lest he were slain, and\nther-with thei pressed fercely to the rescue.  Whan the kynge Arthur\nsaugh the Geaunt so Iuste that iiij so noble men hadde\nouer-throwen, he swore that he wolde hym assayen.  Than he rode\noute of the renge, and caught a grete spere with an hede\ntrenchaunt, and rode a grete walop, and the kynge Ban com hym\na-gein and seide, \"Sir, what will ye do, ne Iusteth not a-gein this\ngrete Geaunte, for he is to stronge for yow that be so yonge and\nso tender to take soche and entirprise, but lete me goo that am\nmore growen and of more strengthe than be ye.\"  Qoud Arthur,\n\"Than God helpe neuer yef I sende eny othir than my-self, for\nthe more that he is to doute, the rather I will hym assaien, ffor\nI shall not elles knowe my self but I assay hym at this\ntyme.\" And whan Merlin saugh that he dide a-bide, he cried lowde,\n\"What, coward, wher-fore a-bideste thow?  whi doste thow\nnot that thow haste vndirtaken, for it is sene that thow arte\na-ferde.\"  Whan Arthur vndirstode how Merlin cleped hym\ncowarde, he was sore a-shamed of that he hadde seide, and smote\nthe horse with the spores in to the renges.  And the kynge Ban\nseide to Merlin that he hadde don euell whan so yonge a man as\nis the kynge Arthur sholde be sente to Iuste a-gein so gret a\ndeuell.  \"No force,\" qoud Merlin, \"he shall do right wele;\nbut take a spere, and folowe after, ye and youre brother and\nVlfin.\"  And thei dide as he badde, and rode after Arthur as\nfaste as the horse myght hem bere.  And whan the kynge Sorfarin saugh Arthur come, he com hym a-geins full fercely;\nand whan thei in the renges saugh hym come so a-gein Arthur,\nthat was so yonge and litell to hym, thei stynte alle, and hadde\ngrete drede for hym.  And thei ronne with all the might that\nthe horse myght yelde, and smote to-geder with speres so grete\nstrokes vpon the sheldes that thei made hem breke and perce;\nand the stiell of the speres stynte at the haubrekes, that were\nstronge and sore-holdynge.  Sorfarins brake his spere but a\nlitill; he wounded the kynge Arthur in the lifte flanke; and\nArthur smote hym a-gein so sore that he perced the shelde and\nthe haubreke that the shafte shewed thourgh the chyne be-hynde\nan arme lengthe; and he shof so rudely that he bar hym from\nhis horse to the erthe vp-right; and he passed forth with-oute\nmore styntynge, and the spere fly on peces that no lenger myght\nsustene. This Iustinge saugh Gonnore, the doughter of kynge leodogan,\nthat was at the windowes in the paleise that ioyned to the\nwalles of the town, and she preised moche the yonge knyght, and\nasked of hem that were a-boute her what he was; but thei ne\ncowde not sey, saf that he was oon of the sowdiours that her\nfader hadde with-holden.  \"Trewly,\" seide the mayden,\n\"what-so-ever he be, hym semeth that he is come of high lynage; ffor\nno man of lowe berthe durste not vndirtake no soche dedes, but\nyef it com of high herte; and he and these worthi men ther haue\nthis day don many faire dedes of armes.\"  Longe tyme heilde\nthis mayden her tale of the sowdiours.  And the kynge ban and\nthe kynge Boors were in the renges, and ech of hem a grete\nspere.  Than thei smote theire horse with the spores, and the\nkynge Ban smote Sortebran, and the kynge Boors smote Clariel,\nand Vlfin smote Iaisdon; and ech of these thre bar his felow to\nthe erthe deed fro theire horse; and with the same cours oon\nsmot moras, and a-nother hitte laidon, and the thirde Senebant\nso sore, that deed thei moste nede be er thei myght oute of the\nfeilde.  And the kynge Arthur drough oute his swerde, and\nsmote so malore vpon the helme that was restinge vpon the\nkynge Ban, ffer he and frelent were besy to smyte of his heed, ffor that oon heilde hym by the helme, and the tother smote hym\nbe-twene the shulderes with a grete axe.  And whan Arthur\nsaugh this he hasted thider with his swerde in his honde, and\nsmote so harde malore that the heed fill in to \u00fee felde. Whan ffreelent saugh his felowe deed, that was his cosin, he\ntoke the axe with bothe handes, and reised it for to\nsmyte the kynge Arthur vpon the helme.  And he kepte the\nstoke vpon his shelde, but the stroke com so harde that it fill fro\nhym in to the feilde; and the stroke descended vpon his lefte\nsholder so sore that he bente on his horse nekke.  And Geaunt\nreised his axe to recouer a-nother stroke, but Arthur was ther-of\nware, and smote the horse with the spores and passed forth, and\nthan returned with his swerde, and smote so ffreelent with soche\nmyght that he slyt hym to the teth.  And than a-roos the showte\nand the noyse of the saisnes, that sore were affraide of that\nencounter, and saugh that thei hadde no more socoure but of\nRandoul, that bar here baner.  And the kynge Ban smote so\nRandoul that the arme fill fro the body, and the baner anoon fill\nto the erthe.  Than a-roos a showte and so grete noyse that alle\nthei tho turned to flight, and the chase be-gan that longe endured,\nfor from euensonge it lasted vn-to nyght; and ther was grete\noccision, for of the ix Ml ne lefte but iiij Ml , that fledde to siege to\nkynge Rion, and tolde hym the losse and damage that thei\nhadde resceyved, and the grete mortalite that vpon hem was\nturned.  And whan the kynge it herde, he swor his oth that\nneuer he wolde departe oute of the londe till that he hadde take\nthe kynge leodogan and put hym in prison. Than he sente in to the londe of Denmarke that alle high\nbarouns sholde come to hym, and brynge with hem plente\nof vitaile for two hundred thowsande men for two yere, for he\nseide now he wolde encrese his werre more vigerously than ever\nhe hadde don be-fore.  And thei com and assembled euery day\nthat in shorte tyme were ther with hym assembled CC l. Ml ; and at\nthis assemble were xx ti kynges crowned; and the kynge Rion\nhym-self was the twentithe kynge.  And with hem com huge\ncarriage of vitaile oute of alle parties, wher-with the hoste was stuffed, that thei rode not on forroy for no vitaile, ffor grete\nplente thei hadden of the londes of the xx ti kynges that weren\nin the hoste; and ofte tymes thei assailed the Citee, that was\nright stronge, that nothynge ne dowted, saf only for famyn.\nAnd thei sente to kynge leodogan for socour, that he sholde come\nhem to helpe, for sore were thei greved.  But now resteth the\ntale of kynge Rion, and of his seige that was grete, and of hem\nthat were in the Citee of Daneblaise, and returne for to speke of\nkynge Arthur and of his companye. Now seith the booke that gladde and ioyfull were thei of the\ntown of Toraise for the discounfiture of the saisnes, that\nwere chased of so small a peple, for thei were at the bygynnynge\nbut vj Ml and iij hundred, and the saisnes were more than xv Ml ,\nand were discounfited be the counseile of Merlin, that moche\nhem helped, and by the knyghtes of the rounde table, and also\nof the xlij sowdioures.  And, as the booke seith, whan thei\nhadde chased the saisnes vnto nyght, that than thei returned to\nToraise gladde and mery, and fonde the kynge in the town, that\nhis men hadde remounted, and sette on horse.  And whan he\nknewe that the sowdiours com, he wente hem ageins, and made\nof hem the grettest ioye that eny man myght, and founde Antor\nand Gifflet, and kay, and lucas the botiller, and alle the other\nfelowes hool and sounde, of whom thei hadden had grete drede\nthat thei hadden be deed or elles taken.  And there was founde\ngrete wynnynge; and the kynge made it to be take and\npresented to the sowdiours that he hadde with-holden.  And he\nseide he myght it no better employe, for thei hadde it alle\nwonne; \"and my-self,\" seide the kynge leodogan, \"haue thei\nrescued fro deth and fro prison.\" And whan thei saugh the grete worschip that the kynge hem\ndide, thei thanked hym hertely, and seide that thei\nwolde it not, for in tyme comynge thei resceve his yeftes and\ntake of hym other fee.  And the kynge seide, seth thei wolde it\nnot resceyve that thei sholde it departe, and yeve ther as thei\nwolden.  Than com Merlin to the thre kynges, and bad hem take it; and thei it token, and yaf it ther as Merlin hem assigned,\nthat thei ne lefte not to hem-self the valewe of a peny.  And\nthei that it hadden, thanked and preised moche the sowdiours, alle\ntho that hem knewen, and also thei knewe hem no-thynge; and\nthat so moche were thei be-loved in the contrey for her largesse\nbe the counseile of Merlin, that nought was spoken of in the\ncontrey but of the sowdiours.  And the kynge Arthur yaf so\nmoche to his Ooste and to his wif of horse, and palfreyes, and\nrobes, that alle thier lyves after were thei riche. Whan the kynge Arthur hadde departed the richesse that\nwas wonne of the saisnes, thei entred in to the town;\nand the kynge leodogan wolde not suffre hem in no wise to\na-light but at his paleise with hym, ne neuer after wolde he lete\nhem be oute of his companye, and with the knyghtes of the\nrounde table.  And whan thei were vn-armed, the kynge made\nhis doughter to aray hem in riche robes, and made her take\nwarme water in basyns of siluer, and bare to the thre kynges and\nhem serue; but Arthur wolde not take her seruyse till that the\nkynge leodogan and Merlin commaunded hym and made hym to\ntake it.  And the maiden her-silf wosh his visage and his nekke\nand dried it full softely with a towaile, and than after to the\ntother twey kynges.  And the tother Gonnore, that was of the\nstiwardes wif, and the other maydenes, serued the othere\nknyghtes.  And whan the kynges doughter hadde serued the thre kynges,\nthan she serued hir fader; and whan thei were waisch the\nmaiden put on ech of hem a mantell a-boute her nekkes.  And\nthe kynge Arthur was right feire; and the maiden hym be-heilde\nmoche, and he her; and she seide softely to her-self that well\nwere that maiden that so feire a knyght wolde requere hir of\nlove, and, namely, so gode a knyght as is this; and well ought\nshe to be shamed euer after that hym denyed. A-noon were the tables set, and whan the mete was redy\nthei satte alle the knyghtes ther-ynne; but the knyghtes\nof the rounde table seten with the sowdiours at table be hem-self;\nand the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors sette the kynge Arthur\nbe-twene hem two, and dide hym grete honour as affiered to so high a man; and ther-of toke the kynge leodogan goode hede,\nthat by hem satte side by syde at the heede of the table, and\nthought well in his corage that by the honour and the reuerence\nthat thei to hym bar that he was lorde ouer alle, and merveiled\nsore what he myght be, and grete desire he hadde for to knowe\nthe trowthe what he was, and thought in his herte that \"and it\nwere pelesynge to god that he hadde my doughter spoused, for\ntrewly I can not thynke that so high prowesse myght be shewed\nin soche a childe, but yef he were come of right high lynage,\nother elles I trowe that it be som spirituell man that god hath\nme sente for to deffende this reame, nought for me but for\nCristynte and holy cherche to mayntene;\" and ther-to he seide ne\nyede he not oute of this town with-oute leve of the porter. At this soper the kynge leodogan sat stille in a grete stodye,\nand lasted longe, and it fill in his mynde how that he\nhym rescued in the depe valay with the xlj felowes a-gein v C\nknyghtes, that ledde hym to prison, and remembrede alle the prowesses that he hadde sein hym do, and so sadly he sat in that\nthought that alle thei were troubled, and lefte theire mete.  Of\nthis was war hervy de ryvel, and was ther-fore sory in his herte,\nand a-roos and yede to hym full wroth to the heede of the table,\nand seide, \"Sir, I saugh neuer yow so mys-take youre-self, ne\nneuer I saugh yow so a-baisshed, ffor ye ought well to make ioye\nto these worthi men; and ye thenke as that ye were in a dreme,\nand I merveile moche of youre grete wisdome where it is\nbe-come.\"  Than the kynge yaf a grete sigh, and loked on hervy,\nand seide \"Hervy, frende, I thought vpon the most worthi man\nof the worlde, fro the whiche I myght not me with-drawe; and\nyef thow knewe what my dought were thow woldest not me\nblame.\"  And he seide, \"Sir, it may well be so, but now at this\ntyme cesseth till efte-sones, for this is no place now ther-to, but\nmaketh ioye to these barouns and disporte yow, for ye haue at this\ntyme to moche yow mystaken saue youre honoure.\"  \"Gramercy,\nfeire frende,\" seide the kynge, \"I knowe well that I haue\nmysdon.\"  Then hervy yede, and satt down by his felowes; and\nthe kynge tho spake to the barouns merily.  And the maiden that was the doughter of kynge leodogan serued Arthur vpon\nher kne of wyne with hir fader cuppe.  And Arthur hir be-heilde\nfull debonerly, and plesed hym wele that he saugh hir so nygh,\nffor she was the feirest lady that was in all Breteigne in that\ntyme; and the mayden was fayre, and hadde on hir heede a\nriche chapelet of preciouse stones, and her visage fressh and wele\ncolowred, so entermedled white and reade so naturally that it\nneded nother more ne lesse, and her shulderes streyghte and\neuen, and merveylously well shapen of body, for she was sklender\na-boute the flankes and the haunche lowe and comly well sittynge,\nand of alle fetures the feirest shapen that myght be founde in eny\nlonde; and yef she hadde grete bewte ther-to she hadde as moche\nbounte of valour, of curtesie, and nurture. Whan Arthur saugh this mayden that hadde so grete bewte,\nhe be-heilde her with a gladde chere, and saugh her\npappes smale and rounde as two smale appelis that were harde;\nand her flessh whitter than snowe, and was not to fatte ne to\nsklender; and he coveyted her gretly in his herte, that he waxe\nall pensif, and lefte his mete, and turned his chere a-nother wey,\nfor he wolde not the two kynges ne noon other hym\na-perceyved.  Than the mayden profered hym the cuppe, and seide, \"Sir,\ndrynke, and displese yow not, though I clepe yow not be youre\nname, and be ye not a-baisshed at youre sopere, for at armes ye do\nnot faile at no nede, and well it shewed this day, where ye were\nbe-holden of v Ml , that nothynge yow dide knowe but by\nsight.\"  And he turned and seide, \"Feire lady, with goode will, and\ngramercy of youre seruyse; and god graunte me power that I\nmay yow this guerdon yelde.\"  \"Sir,\" seide she, \"ye haue quyte it double more than I may deserue, ffor ye haue rescued my\nlorde my fader, ye and youre companye, that was a-monge so many\nof his enmyes that ledde hym to prison.\"  And he satte stille\nwith-oute ansuere.  \"And,\" quod the lady, \"was ther moche\nmore, for here be-fore the yates at the brigge foote ye shewed\nwell sembelant that it yow greued, and that ye were sory for his\na-noye ther as he was vn-horsed a-monge his enmyes, and his horse vndir hym slayn, for ye slow hym that hym dide ouerthrowe, and\nye youre-self were in auenture of deth hym to rescuen, and so\nwele ye dide that thei were fayn to leve the feelde.\" Thus spake the doughter of kynge leodogan to Arthur, but he\nspake no worde a-gein, but toke the cuppe and dranke\nwith goode will, and after commaunded the mayden to a-rise, for to\nlonge hadde she kneled, but the kynge her fader ne wolde\nnot.  Thus were thei serued right highly of alle thynges that man\nmyght devise.  And whan the clothes sholde be taken vp the\nkynge ban seide to kynge leodogan that satte next by hys side,\n\"Sir,\" seide the kynge Ban, \"I haue grete merveile of yow that\nbe so wise and worthy a man that haue not maried youre doughter\nto som high prynce that myght yow helpe in youre werres, ffor\nshe is now wele woxen and ther-to right wise; and as me semeth\nye haue no mo heyres to whom youre londe shall descende after\nyoure deth, and therfore ye sholde here be-fore haue her sette to\nsome noble prynce.\"  \"Certes, sir,\" seide leodogan, \"I haue be\nletted by the werre that me sore hath greved and longe dured,\nffor it is vij yere passed that the kynge Rion of Denmarke and of\nIrelonde ne cessed neuer vpon me to werre; ne neuer seth com\nther no man in this londe to whom I ought hir to yeve; but, so\nhelpe me god, yef I myght fynde a yonge bacheler that were a\nworthi man of armes that myght wele endure peyne and trauayle\nto meyntene my werre, To hym wolde I yeve my doughter yef he\nwolde her take, and alle my londe after my desesse, that neuer\nshall I spare for high lynage ne grete richesse of lordeschip; and\nthat it plesed oure lorde Ieshu that it myght ben he that I thynke\nnow in my mynde, and trewly than sholde she be maried\nwithynne these thre dayes vnto a feire yonge bacheler that is full of\nhigh prowesse, and trewly I suppose in my corage that he be of\nhiher astate than am I.\"  And Merlin be-heilde the kynge Boors\nand be-gan to smyle, and made hym a signe that it was seide for\nthe kynge Arthur, and with-oute faile for hym was it seide. Than be-gonne thei to speke of many thynges, and turned her\ntales other weyes, for more wolde thei not speke ther-of\nat that tyme.  That perceyvede well the kynge leodogan that thei heilde no cure to mayntene that tale, and ther-with he yaf\na sore sigh, for fayn he wolde that oon hadde hym more ther-of\na-resoned; and so he heilde his pees and herkened yef he myght\neny thynge a-perceyve in eny manere what thei were and of what\nlonde, and saugh the ioye and the honoure that the worthi men made to Arthur, and that was a thynge that brought hym more\nmys-ese, and so moche the worthy men of the rounde table more\nthan the xl felowes that were of her companye, that alle that it\nsaugh hadde ther-of merveile, and weren a-basshed; but a-bove\nalle hym coveyted the kynges doughter, and right hertely she\nhym loved, and mused here-on so moche that she was sore\ntroubeled, and fayn wolde she haue hym to be her lorde, and\nmake a-bove alle tho that euer she hadde seyn be-fore; and the\nstoryes seyn that she was the wisest lady of all the bloy breteyne,\nand the feirest and the beste be-loved that euer was in the londe\nor in the contrey, saf only Helayn that was with-outen pere, that\nwas the doughter of kynge Pelles of lytenoys, of the Castell of\nCorbenyk, that was nece to the kynge Pesceor, and of the seke\nkynges wounded, wher-of the name of the ton was cleped alain\nde lille in lytenoys.  This kynge alain was seke of the woundes\nof the spere vengeresse, wher-of he was cleped mehaignyes, for\nhe was wounded thourgh bothe thyghes with that spere; and his\nright name was kynge Alain, and the kynge Pellynor was his\nbrother germayn, and this maiden of whom I speke was theire\nnece and doughter to kynge Pelles, brother to these two kynges\nthat I haue yow named. This mayden was the feirest lady that euer was in eny londe;\nthis same maiden hadde in kepynge the blissed seint\nGraal vn-to the tyme that Galaad was vpon here be-geten; but\nat this tyme cesseth the storye of hir, but it shall here-after be\ndeclared how that she was discesed of the seint Graal and\nwherfore, and how the aventures of the seynt Graal were brought to\nfin; and speketh of the companye that be at the table at soper at\nToraise in the paleise of kynge leodogan. Full richely were these lordes serued at soper of wyne and\nvitaile; and whan the tables were vp Merlin toke the thre kynges a-part, and seide, \"Will ye that I tell yow what\nis be-fallen in breytene la bloy?\"  \"Certes,\" seide Arthur,\n\"right moche I desire to wite, yef it yow plese.\"  Than seide\nMerlin, \"I do yow to wite that thei haue had stronge bataile\nbe-fore logres in the playn a-gein the saisness, that all the contrey\nhadde robbed, and all the maryne and the portes toward Dover;\nand whan thei come thourgh the feldes, thei ledde huge cariage\ntowarde the hoste of the saisnes; and thei were moo than x Ml horse-men; and as thei rode in soche maner thei mette fyve\nchilderen that be youre neuewes;\" and than he tolde hym how\nthe childeren were comen and fro whens, and how they were\ndeparted fro theire moderes with-oute witynge of theire fader,\nand how that thei mette the forryours, as ye haue herde be-fore,\nand how the bataile was grete ther, as the saisnes were\ndiscounfited, and of the grete richesse that ther was wonne, and the gret\nioye that the Citee of hem made after the bataile, and how the\nchilderen wolde neuer be knyghtes till that he made hem\nknyghtes with his owne honde; \"and drede yow not,\" quod\nMerlin, \"of youre londe, for thei shull it well deffende in to the\ntyme of youre comynge.

EXPLOITS OF THE REBEL KINGS AGAINST THE SAXONS. Whan the kynge Tradilyuant was come in to North Walys to\nhis chief Citee, and hadde somowned to-geder his peple,\nthat he hadde x Ml , and he kepte his londe and his contrey the\nbeste wise that he myght; and on an euen com a spie, that com\nfro the roche of the saisnes, and seide ther com x Ml saisnes with\ngrete cariage of vitaile, that were entred his londe and wente the\nstreight wey to the grete Oste.  And whan the kynge that\nvndirstode, he asked how fer thei myght be; and he seide thei\nmyght be wele be-twene the roche and Arundell.  Than\ncomaunded the kynge his peple to arme hem hastely, and lepe to\nhorse at the first Cok crowinge, and issed oute of the town alle\narmed; and whan thei were oute in the feilde thei were well\nx Ml , and rode forth cloos, and renged a softe paas till thei com in\nto the hoste of the saisnes; and than departed her peple in\ntweyne, of which Polydamas condited the ton, that was nevew to\nthe kynge, and was a yonge knyght of grete hardynesse.  And as\nsone as thei were departed the firste parte yede towarde Arundell,\nthat the kynge Arthur lete garnyssh er he departed oute of the\ncontrey, whan Polydomas was departed from his vncle he and his\npeple, and were nygh the tentes, thei rode in as faste as the\nhorse myght renne.  That tyme the saisnes made euell waich, for\nthei were nothinge war till these were euein a-monge hem; ther were many mangled and slayn of the saisnes, for thei fonde hem\nvn-armed and slepinge, for thei were wery of traveyle, and\ntherfore was a-monge hem grete occision, for on twey partes were\nthei a-baisshed, and thei hadde no leiser to take their armour, but\nturned to flight on horse and on foote towarde the roche and in\nthe forestes that were nygh; and these other hem slowgh and\nmartered all that thei myght reche, so that thei hadde slayn er\nthei myght come to the Castell of the roche more than\nxv Ml .  And whan the knyghtes of Carnyle saugh the grete disconfiture\nas thei were a-risinge, and saugh theire peple fle on euery side,\nand the grete slaughter that these made, thei cried \"as\narmes.\"  Than thei armed hem that were in the Castell with all theire\nmyght, and com oute in all haste; and thei were moche peple\nand riche lordes of grete puyssance, and ther-to were thei well\nhorsed; and whan thei were alle come oute thei were\nxiiij Ml .  Than thei lete theire horse renne, and smyten to-geder right\nharde the ton a-gein the tother; and ther be-gan a stronge bataile\nand harde; and many ther were leide to grounde of horse and\nmen.  And while thei foughten thus to-geder thei of Arundell com\noute that were longinge to kynge Arthur, and were well v C, and\nthei sesed the vitaile wher-of thei founde in the hoste grete\nfoyson; and ther thei wonne grete richesse, and repeyrede agein\nto the castell, and shetten the yates, and lokede how the bataile\nsholde ende, and alwey was the kynge Tradelyuant and his\nnevewe Polydomas sore be-sette on alle parties, and foughten\nsore a-gein the saisnes; and the kinge was at grete myschef, ffor\nther com oute of the Castell the roche xiiij Ml wele armed, and\nronne vpon hem vigerously, for thei were full anguysshouse for\nthe grete losse that thei hadden; and thie drof the kynge bakke\nmore than the space of a bowe draught, ne neuer after myght\nthei holde grounde till thei com vnder Arundell, ther as where\nthey moste a-bide by fin force, or elles playnly dye.  Ther thei\nhem deffended harde and sore, but ther was grete slaughter of\nmen and horse vpon bothe partyes, but at that enuaye loste the\nkynge Tradylyuant moche of his peple, for of x Ml he loste vij Ml ,\nand the saisnes losten iij Ml of the beste that were in the Castell of the roche.  And the kynge Tradilyuant faught sore; he and\nhis peple were ar grete myschef, and it a-bode not longe er thei\nwere alle disconfited; whan hem con to socour the kynge de\nCent Chyualers, that hadde herde tydinges that the saisnes com\nrobbinge the contrey. As soone as the kynge de Cent Chiualiers com half a myle fro\nthe bataile, he mette the peple that fledde from the kynge\nTradilyuaunt, for nygh was he returned to disconfiture. Whan\nthe kynge de Cent Chiualliers mette with hem that fledde fro\nthe bataile, he askede whens thei come; and thei abode and tolde\nhym the a-uenture that was fallen, and how he was dosconfited;\nand whan the kynge vnderstode that Tradilyuaunt was at so grete\nmyschef, he cried, \"Gentill knyghtes!  now suewith me,\" and\nseide, \"Seynt Marie, blissed lady, graunte me that I may hym\nfynde with-oute mayme.\" Than the kynge rode formest hym-self a grete walop, for sore\nhym longed to wite how the kynge Tradilyuaunt hym\ncontened; but he hadde be disconfited longe er than, or deed, or\ntaken, hadde not be that thei of the castell of Arundell, that were\nArthurs men, that hadde so grete pite vpon hem that were\ncristen, that thei com oute more than iiij C vpon a sop, and\nbe-gonne to helpe hem vigerously, and slowe many of the saisnes\nin her comynge; and thei recounforted moche the kynge\nTradilyuant, for moche thei hym sustened.  And ther was the crie and\nthe noyse right grete; but whan the kynge de Cent chiuallires\ncom be-gan the noyse to a-rise so grete that noon myght heren\nother, for he and his men leide down the saisnes with so grete\nrandon, and smote hem so harde in her comyge, that thei leide\niij Ml to grounde that neuer roos after hool ne sounde.  Ther was\na stour anguysshouse and mortall bataile, and so grete slaughter\nof men and of horse, that the horse feet were couered with blode\nand brayn, ffor so moche hadde they foughten con a-gein a-nother,\nthat of xv Ml of the saisnes ne was not lefte ix Ml .  And the kynge\nde Cent chiualers was noble knyght and a sure, and maganors\nhis stiwarde.  Than thei ronne vpon the saisnes so fiercely that\nthe shoute and the noyse a-roos so grete and huge that the saisnes were alle a-baisshed, that thei for-gat all her defence; and\nwhan thei saugh hem that were newe comen all fressh of here\nin-busshement, and saugh thei myght haue no socoure ne helpe on\nno partee, ffor thei were fer fro valdesbiry, where the siege was,\nand at the Castell of the roche thei wiste well nere not past CC\ndefensable, for alle were issed oute for the cry; and saugh also\nwell that nede moste hem dye but yef thei ascaped be flight. Whan the kynge de Cent chiualers, and Tradilyuaunt,\nand marganors, and Polydomas saugh the saisnes so\na-baisshed, thei settte vpon hem fresshly; and whan the saisnes\nsaugh hem come thei durste not a-bide, but turned to flight to\nthe castell of the roche; but er thei com thider thei were hasted\nto nygh, that of ix Ml ne ascaped not iij Ml , that alle were slayn\nand mangeled.  But whan thei of the castell of Arundell saugh\nthe saisnes discounfited, and saugh hem chased, thei with-heilde\nhem be the counseile of a yonge knyght was cleped Ewein\nwith the white handes, and returned thider as the bataile hadde\nbe, and toke horse, and somers, and golde, and siluer, and vitaile\nas moche as hem liked, and of armour of the beste that thei\nfounden, and stuffed hem so wele of alle thinges that neuer after\nhadde thei no suffraite ne nede of nothinge durynge the tyme of\nher beynge there; and whan thei were entred thei shette the\nyates and reyses vp the brigge, and after yede vpon the walles an\nhigh for to se how thei diden that made the chase, for the two\nkynges chased the saisnes till thei come to the castell of the\nroche full sore affraide, and smyten in ther as thei knewe the\nentre, but er thei were alle ynne ther were many slayn and for\nhewen; and whan thei were with-ynne the two kynges saugh\nthei were ascaped thei drough hem a-bakke, ffor moche thei\ndouted the shotte of quarelles and of arowes; and whan thei\nwere come fro the castell half a myle and the two kynges mette\nto-geder, thei made grete ioye, and dide of theire helmes, and\nkysten to-geder, and eche acoled other in armes for grete love,\nwhan thei hadde longe tyme made her ioye in fere.  Than seide\nthe kynge Tradilyuant to the kynge de Cent chiualers, \"Sir, I\nhaue grete merveile how ye com this day hider, and therfore I haue grete cause to thanke oure lorde god, for yef ye hadde\ntaried eny lenger I myght not have ascaped, but that I sholde\nhaue be taken or deed, and also alle my men that were me be\nlefte.\"  \"Sir,\" quod Aguysanx the kynge de Cent chiualers,\n\"Oure lorde that is so gracious, ne foryeteth neuer his seruaunt\nin what he be, but paraventure it hym plesith that we shull\nsuffre this martire for to enhaunce his lawes, and therfore hath\nhe sent thise saisnes in to this londe, that euery day ne do but\nencrese more and more; and also we se well that for no peple\nthat we haue in this contrey thei will not be chased oute; and\ntherfore while that we may lyve lete vs avenge oure dethes, ffor\nthat semeth me the beste; what-so-euer falle lete vs do so I sey,\nand wite it well that so shull we sonnest come to an ende than\neny other way.\"  \"Why,\" quod Tradilyuaunt, \"how is youre\nadvys?\"  \"That shall I well telle yow,\" quod Aguysanx, \"we shull sende to alle oure fellowes, that ech of hem come with alle\nhis hool power as privyly as thei may to the castell of wyndesore\nin brochelonde, and we also to assemble alle oure peple and ride\nvpon the saisnes, and yeve hem bataile in the name of god, that\nhe graunte vs the victorie, ffor better is a gode ende and to dye\nwith honour, than longe to endure and after all lese, and than\ndye with dishonour.\"  \"A god mercy, sir!\"  quod\nTradilyuaunt, \"what is it that ye sey?  we knowe wele that thei be so\ngrete plente of peple that for oon that we haue in oure remes thei\nhaue euer xx a-gein oon of oures, and therfore in that manere ne\nmay we not spede.  Not-with-stondinge, I sey not, but as for me\nI will do as ye and alle the other will ordeyne; I am all redy it\nto pursue.\"  \"Certes,\" seide Aguysanx the kynge de Cent\nchiualers, \"I will sende to hem my message on my be-halue,\nlike as I haue yow siede, and that thei do me to wite what is\nis here willes, whether thei will do thus or noon.\" \"In goddes\nname,\" seide Tradilyuant, \"for as for my part I will do as ye and\nalle other will assente, ffor I am but oon sool man as be ye, and\nye ne shull nothinge do but I therto will acorde,\"  With that thei rode forth to Arundell ther the firste bataile hadde be, and\nther thei fonde grete richesse of all that neded to mannes body;\nand ech man toke at his wille of that hym liked, and made noon\nother departynge.  Thus was comen all the richesse and the vitaile;\nand in this maner departed the two kynges, that no more ne dide\nnot at this tyme.  And the kynge Tradilyuaunt rode in to North\nwales with vj Ml men that were hym be lefte of the bataile; and\nthe kynge Aguysanx rode to malohaut with vij Ml men, and after\ntoke his messagers, and sente to the lordes as he hadde seide to\nthe kynge Tradilyuant. Whan the kynge Aguysans was come to his Citee of\nCorenges in Scotlonde, he assembled his peple on\nhorsebak and on foote, that he hadde xv Ml .  And it fill on a\nmonday in the morowe that the saisnes were more than xv Ml , and\nrode be-twene Corenges and lanneriur, and brandons a-gains the\npray that Oriels, and meniadus, and Sorbaries, and margoires, and\nbrandons, and Poigeres, and pyncenars, and Salubrius, and\nmagloras, and Gondoffles the grete, diden condite towarde the\nhoste be-fore Valdesbiry; and as thei come, thei brent and\ndistroyde all the londe, and brent bourghs, and townes, and\ncastelles, and sette all on fier and flame, as thei that all the\nlonde wolde haue brought to nought; and ther-to thei made so\ngrete martire of peple thourgh the contrey, that ye myght haue\nhadde grete pite were youre herte neuer so harde, for ladies and\nmaidenes that thei slowen and her childeren in her armes; and\nther as the mene peple were fledde in to caves for socour, thei\nputt in fier, and brent hem ther-ynne; and the tidinges ran so\nthourgh the contrey that the kynge aguysanx it herde; and than\nhe comaunded alle his barouns to armen hem; and thei dide his\ncomaundement, and lepe to horse, and rode two myle er day; and\nthan thei rode forth a softe pas till it was passed pryme.  Than\nthei loked towarde lanneriur, and saugh the eyr trouble, and\nthikke of duste, and flames of fier that thei hadde sette in the\ncontrey, and herde the noyse and the cry that the peple made\nof her losse and damage, and for her frendes \u00feat thei saugh\nmartired be-fore her yen; and thei ther-fore were full anguysshouse, and rode forth a grete spede, and were well xiiij Ml ; and\nhem condited the kynge Anguysans in the formest fronte with\nvij Ml , that were yonge bachelers and hardy.  This Gaudius was\ncosin germain to Aguysans on his fadir side; and he dide after\nmany feire chiualries be-fore the castell, for the damesell of\nbrulent, that he wolde haue hadde be force to his wif, and was\nbe-fore the riche town that was so moche preised er that Gaudius it\nconquered by his prowesse, as the storie shall telle here-after, for\nit is yet no tyme ther-to, but returne to the kynge aguysans of\nScotlonde, that rode to-geder, he and Gaudius, till thei fill\na-monge the forriours and a-monge the cariage; and a-noon thei\nsmote to-geder fercely, that ther was many oon ouerthrowen\nbothe horse and man; and thei dide the saisnes grete losse of her\npeple at the be-gynnynge, for thei were oute of aray and spredde\na-brode in the contrey, oon here, a-nother ther; and the kynge\naguysans and Gaudius and her peple slowe of hem moo than\nvij Ml .  And whan the kynge of the saisnes com in to the bataile\nwhere-as thei were fightynge, than was Gaudius and his\ncompanye at grete myschef, for the saisnes were moo than xl Ml , what\noon and other and of the cristen were but xiiij Ml .  Neuertheless, thei\ndeffended hem right longe, but euer the saisnes encresed, that it\nwas wonder to be-holde, for fro the bataile was but x myle fro\nthe hoste; and the x kynges that I yow nempned com on\nthe tother side wele horsed and armed with so grete plente\nof peple that all the contrey was couered on euery side,\nand thei drof the cristin a-wey whether thei wolde or\nnoon.  Ffull grete losse hadde ther the kynge Aguisans, and grete\ndamage of his knyghtes and of his men, ffor er none was\npassed the saisnes mette hem so sharply that of xiiij Ml that he\nbrought in his companye ne myght he not assemble vj Ml that alle\nne were dede or taken, and ne hadde be oon a-venture that fill,\nther hadde neuer of hem ascaped oon a-wey; but the kynge Vrien\nwas comen oute in the morowe for the hete, he and his nevew\nBandemagn, that was a noble knyght and an hardy and sure, and lefte Ewein his sone in the Citee, that was a feire chielde and\nof high prowesse, that hadde be-geten on Arthurs suster, that\nwas so goode a lady a-gein god and also to the worlde.  With\nEwein also was Meliagans, that at that tyme was a young childe,\nand was the sone of Bandemagn by his firste wif.  These two\nchilderen kepte the Citee right wele, but knyghtes were thei\nnoon, for thei were to yonge of age; and with hem also was\nEwein a-voutres, that was the kynges sone Vrien be the stiwardes\nwif, that was of grete bewte; and therfore the kynge lefte his owne wif more than fyve yere, and kepte her in his house maugre\nhis stiwarde till that he hadde this childe.  Whan that the childe\nwas born ther rose so grete a scentence of cursinge that he most\nnedes leve her whe\u00feer that he wolde or noon; but the childe he\nkepte and norisshed till it was feire well woxen and that he myght\nride after to court; and the kynge that loved hym moche in his\nherte yaf hym of his londe grete plente, that he myght wele\nmayntene goode meyne a-boute hym.  This Ewein, that was geten in\nadvoutry, was gentill and curteyse and full of hardynesse, and for\nthe grete love that the kynge hadde to hym, he brought hym\nforth in the companye of his son Ewein the grete; and for that\nhe was geten in a-vouterye was he cleped Ewein the a-vouteres,\nand the tother, that was his right heir be his wif, was cleped\nEwein the more; and this Ewein was a passinge feire childe\nand bolde and hardy; but after that he hadde herde speke of\nkynge Arthur he wolde not suffre that noon made hym knyght; ne his fader, ne noon other, but seide ofte to his counseile and\nthat was to Ewein his brother that he loved moche, and was\nyonger than he; and he tolde hym that he wolde neuer be\nknyght till that the kynge Arthur, his Oncle, yaf hym the\nordere, and girde the swerde be hys syde; and the tother Ewein\nseide that right so wolde he do.  Thus lefte thei for to kepe the town,\nand the kyng Vrien and Bandemagn hem spedde so till that thei\ncom to the bataile euen as the kynge aguysanx was discounfited,\nand was merveillously sorowfull.  Ne noon myght telle the\nmaltalent that he hadde, and that after he shewde well semblant,\nfor as soone as it come to the chase he smote a-monge the saisnes so fiercely as a wode lyon; and he was wele horsed as to soche a\nman be-longeth, and hadde in his companye x Ml men that were\nwele horsed.  Than were the saisnes ascride a-lowde and harde\nI-smyten.  Ther fill many in swowne that neuer after a-roos;\nffull sharp and crewell was this stour, for the meyne that com\nwith kynge Vrien were full profitable and hardy, and foughten\nall the day longe, and suffred grete travaile.  And the kynge\nAguysans wente in to his Cite disconfited, ffor the chace lefte of\nhym for to fight with the kynge vrien and his peple; and ther\nwas grete slaughter of men and of horse bothe, for neuer so small\na peple made so grete occision.  But longe the kinge vrien and\nhis men ne myght not endure, ffor a-gein hem were so grete foyson\nof peple that hem nothinge ne spared, but dide hem the greef\nthat thei myght with all theire power; but the nyght com that\nmade hem departe.  And the kynge vrien wente to Sorhan, he\nand his peple, alle for brosed and full wery of trauayle and of\nstrokes that thei hadde yeuen and resceyved; but the saisnes\nlefte in the place ther the bataile hadde I be, and laye that\nnyght stille armed; but to the kynge vrien com a feire a-venture\nthat ought not to be for-yeten in the tale, for he fonde a rowte of\nsaisnes in a launde a-boute mydnyght, that ledde grete richesse\ntowarde the hoste of vitaile, and also of other harneyse, as robes\nand money and bestes, and were well iij Ml that these richese dide\ncondite; and thei were sette to theire soper with grete foyson of\nvitaile, and wende to haue hadde no drede of no man, ffor thei\nknewe well the disconfiture of hem and the kynge Aguysanx,\nand therfore were thei deseuered fro the grete companye for the\nhastier spede, and for to come the soner to the siege that was\nbe-fore the town of valdesbery. Whan the kynge vrien and Bandemagn, his nevew, saugh\nthe saines in this manere, and the teintes and pavelons\nthat thei hadde pight, and the gret light that was with-ynne the\npavilouns, thei made a-noon to aske what peple it were; and thei\nthat were with-ynne the pavylouns a-noon ansuerde, and seide\nthei were with the kynge Brangore of Saxon.  Whan the kynge\nvrien and Bandemagn, his nevew, herde that thei were saisnes that thei hadde founden, thei cried \"as armes;\" and her peple\nseide, \"Now as armes, for now it shall be preved who is goode\nand who is cowarde.\"  And thei sette vpon hem, and founde hem\nvn-armed, and therfore was in hem but pore deffense; and the cristen be-gonne to ouerthrowe pavylouns vpon her heedes, and on\nher mete.  Ther sholde ye haue sein grete trouble of tables\ndowncaste and the vitaile I-spredde wide, and cuppes and pecys of\nsiluer and bordclothes and towayles vnder the horse feet, but ther\nwas grete occision of saisnes that the cristin peple hem dide, that\nhem hated of mortuall hate; and as the storie seith, that the cristin\nwere yet viij Ml , and  of the saisnes ne were but iij Ml , and alle\nvn-armed, as thei that were sette at soper, and wende not to haue\nhadde no drede.  And the nyght was feire and clere, and a softe\nweder in the myddill of Aprill.  And the saisnes were so hewen\nand martired in shorte tyme that of the iij Ml ascaped not xl, and\nthat ne were slain with speres, and swerdes, and axes; and thei\nthat ascaped ronne in to wodes and in to grete forestes, and made\nso grete sorowe that no man cowde telle.  And whan the saisnes\nwere thus disconfited and fledde, the kynge vrien and his peple\ngedered vp that was lefte ther of the saines that was grete\nrichesse, and wente the right wey to Sorhant with-oute eny\nother distrubier, and were gladde and mery after the aventure\nthat was hem be-fallen. After that the kynge vrien and Bandemagn were departed\nfro the bataile, as ye haue herde, ther com tydinges how\nthat Gawein, and Agrauain, and Gaheret, and Gaheries, and\nGalashin were departed from theire faders so yonge childeren for\nto be made knyghtes with-oute takynge leve, and were goynge to\nlogres for to take her armes of the kynge Arthur; but thei haue\nhym not founden, for he was gon in to the reame of Tamelide;\nand the childeren were lefte at logres, and kepte right wele the\nmarches, and seiden thei wolde neuer remeve thens till theire\noncle were come home, and also how thei hadden gete the richest\nprise that euer was sein in her comynge.  And so these tydinges ronne thourgh the londe that Ewein herde speke ther-of, that was\nArthur suster sone; and than he seide to his moder in prive\ncounseile, \"Ffeire moder, my cosins beth gon to the court of\nkynge Arthur hym for to serue, and for to take theire armes of\nhym; and we ne mowe not be in no gretter myschef than we\nbeth now ynne, and therfore I wolde haue youre counceile how\nthat I sholde do, ffor in no manere will I do no thinge that sholde\nyow displese; and ye knowe wele that my fader hath yoven his\nlonde that be com on his syde to Bandemagn, his nevew, after\nhis discesse, in the tyme of Vterpendragon, and he may no more\nthynge fro me be-reve what wratth that euer I haue of hym, for\nthe londe that cometh of youre be-halue ne may I not lese, but\nyef it be youre will; and though I lese all I will go with my\ncosins to serue myn oncle; and therfore a-ray me so that I go\nwith worship, for how-so-euer that it be I will go, for I haue\nlever ther to dye than here for to lyve as in prison, and therfore\nsey me lightly what is youre pleiser.\" Whan the lady herde Ewein her sone so speke, she be-gan\nto wepe for ioye and for pitee, ffor well she knewe\nthat the herte com fro the high lynage on hir syde, and seide,\n\"Ffeire some Ewein, wher haue ye take that talent and that\nherte for to leve me and to serue another?\"  And he ansuerde,\n\"Ha, dame!  for goddes love, mercy!  I reporte me to all the\nworlde, and my herte also telleth me, that he is youre brother and\nmyn oncle, and also my cosins beth go in to his londe, and\ntherfore were I a grete cowarde to a-bide here, where as I may no\nprofite do ne availe, and yef I helpe not hym for to mayntene his\nlonde as my cosins do; and therfore, thaugh ye yeve me no leve\nI will go; and now ordeyne so for me that I may go in soche\nthat it be youre worship and myn.\"  \"Ffeire sone,\" seide the\nlady, \"a-bide a-while, and I shall a-paraile yow so prively that\nyoure fader shall it not wite, for and he it wiste, all youre iourney\nwere loste; and gete yow soche felship as ye will haue, and I\nshall purveye for horse and armes, and robes and money I-nowgh\nto spende.\"  \"Madame,\" seide Ewein, \"gramercy;\" and than\nhe com to his brother Ewein a-voutres, and discouered to hym his corage; and whan he hadde all seide, the tother ansuerde and\nseide that he sholde neuer go in to no strange londe with-oute\nhym yef god wolde, and that he was redy to move what tyme\nthat euer he wolde.  Quod Ewein, \"I will that we departe\nwithynne these viij dayes.\"  And with that the bretheren departed,\nand made hem redy; and Ewein the a-voutres so purchased as he\nthat was manly and wise, that he hadde in his companye an\nhundred felowes, and Ewein the more hadde CC; and his moder\nhym ordeyned robes, and money, and horse, and armure grete\nplente.  And on an euenynge after soper thei departed a-boute\nmydde-nyght, at the firste cok crowinge, by leve of the lady;\nand hem condited ffragien, a yonge gentilman, that knewe alle\nthe estres of the forestes and the weyes; but now of hem resteth\nthe tale, and returned to speke of kynge ventres of Garlot. Whan the kynge Ventres of Garlot vndirstode that he hadde\nloste his sone Galashin, he was right hevy and wroth,\nand in especiall toward his wif Basyne, so that he spake not to\nhir all a moneth nother goode ne badde.  Than fill it on a\nthursday at even in the moneth of Aprille, in the tyme that these\nerbes and trees be-gynne to florissh, and the briddes singen with\nther voys for the swetnesse of the newe mery seson, that a\nmessanger com and tolde hym the grete distruxion where-as the\nkynge Aguysanx hadde I-be, and how the saisnes hadde hym\ndisconfited, and how that he hadde be deed or take, ne hadde be\nthe kynge vrien that com hym for to socour, wher-fore the\nchase sessed of the kynge Aguysanx; and after com a-nother\nmessager, that tolde hym of the grete distruxion of the saisnes\nthat the kynge Tradyliuant and the kynge de cent chiualers hadde\ndon be-twene Randoul and the roche, where-as thei hadde riche\nenprise.  And whan the kynge ventres herde these tydinges he\nwas right hevy for the distresse of the kynge Aguysanx, and on\nthe tother side he was right gladde of the kynge Tradilyuaunt\nand of the kynge de Cent chiualers, than he be-thought in hys\nherte that he wolde go serche the marches be-twene Northwalis and Sorloys, where-as the passage was right grete; but he hadde\nnot longe be in this stodye whan in his owne contrey he herde so\ngrete noyse and clamor of peple that fledde on euery side. A noon the kynge lete aske what the peple eiled.  And thei\nseide that alle the saisnes of the worlde were entred in to\nhis londe, and brente, and distroied, and slowgh alle that thei\nmyght atteyne.  And ther-to ther was of hem so grete\nmultitude that it was merveile, and were loigged vpon the river of\nsourne be-fore the castell of brolende in the medowes; and ther\nthei a-bide the grete carriage of vitaile, and of hem is captein the\nkynge Magondes, that was cosin to Aungis; and the kynge\nffansobres, and the kynge Groales, and the kynge Pyngnores, and\nthe kynge fforreyours cometh be-fore more than with xx MI , that\nbe spredde thourgh all youre londe, and brenne and distoie and\nsle the peple; and yef ye will not this be-leve, ye may it bothe\nheere and see.  And whan the kynge ventres saugh his londe thus\nturne to distruxion, he knewe wele that he myght not a-bide\nlonge with-out grete damage. A noon the kynge cryed with high voys, \"Gentill knyghtes,\nnow as armes, for now shall be shewed youre\nworthynesses, ffor he nys no knyght that will not deffende his londe and\nhis contrey a-gein his mortall enmyes.\"  Than ronne thei to armes\nknyghtes and squyres grete foyson bothe oon and other thourgh\nthe town; and when thei were redy thei were xij Ml .  And the\nkynge ventres toke of hem vj Ml , and yaf hem to Doriax for to\nlede, and moche hym requered for to well and to be gode knyght,\nand so in trouthe he was a noble knyght, and right nygh cosin to\nthe kynge.  And he rode that wey as he saugh the mene peple\ncome fleynge, and spedde hym so that he com ther as thei made\nthe martire and the Occision of the peple, and were in the\nformest frounte v Ml ; but thei were not alle in array, for thei\nwere spredde a-brode in the contrey down by the river, that brent\nand robbed.  And whan dorilas saugh with his iye that thei\ndide so grete damage that were soche mysbelevynge peple, he\nrode vpon hem full Irously.  And whan he com nygh bothe he\nand his men lete reine as faste as the horse myght hem bere, and smote hem so with sharp speres and trenchaunt, that many of the\nsaisnes ther-with were throwe to grounde, and many slayn, ffor\nthei were so supprised that thei were not ware till thei were ynne\na-myd monge hem that thei slowgh of hem more than two partes\ner the kynge ventres was come; and the remenaunt turned to\nflight in to the hoste of briolors, where as the iiij kynges were\nloged.  And dorilas hem enchased and slough and martired, and\ndide hem gret turment; and whan he hadde hem pursude to the\ntentes and the pauylouns, and it was noone passed of the day, and\nwhan the saisnes saugh hem so fle, thei ronne to armes, but for\nall theire haste thei myght not be so soone armed er ther were v C tentes and pavilouns ouer-throwen vpon theire hedes, and moo\nthan a thousande me slayn. Than thei be-gonne to blowe hornes and trompes nexte to the\nteinte of kynge Margondre, and ther assembled and\ngadered so grete plente of peple that thei were more than\nxxx Ml .  And than rode the iiij kynges; and it fill that thei mette first\nwith the kynge Galagnes with iiij Ml men or moo, and mette with\ndorilas, that moche hym peyned to greve the saisnes, and hadde\nright wele do all the day; and heilde stronge spere that he hadde\ntake from a saisne.  And as sonne as dorilas and Maglans saugh\nech other, thei lette renne and mette to-geder so sore vpon the\nsheldes that thei perced, and the haubrekes were stronge that no\nmaile ne brake, but the speres splyndered on peces; and thei\npassed thourgh and hurteled to-geder so harde with the horse\nmyght that bothe fill to grounde, and their horse vpon theire\nbodies. Whan dorilas and Maglans thus hadde eche other\nouerthrowen, bothe partess pressed to the rescu; and ther\nwere many hurte, and sharpe medle ther was a stronge bataile\nand grete man slaughter on bothe sithes; and with grete labour\nwere bothe dorilas and Maglaans horsed; but grete losse of peple\nfill vpon the saisnes side, ffor thei were many of hem vn-armed,\nbut yet hadde thei had gretter lose ne hadde the kynge ffalsadres\ncome with vij Ml men, that faught with the cristin right\nharde.  But the kynge ventres was a goode knyght and a sure a-bove alle that were in the feilde, ffor he dide merveilouse prowesse in\narmes, and gretly he hym peyned, for he saugh the grete\nnede.  And so, thourgh the helpe of god and his knyght-hode, the vij Ml were discounfited and putt to flight; but as the kynge Pyngnores\ncom with vij Ml saisnes, that hem recounforted and moche\nsustened, for thei smyten in a-monge the kynge Ventres meyne and\nmade hem to remeve more than a bowe draught from the tentes\nand the pavilouns be-twene the wode and the rivere.  And whan\nthe kynge ventres saugh his men go in soche manere, he cried his\nensigne, and seyde, \"Gentill knyghtes, whether ar ye a-wey?\nreturne and selle your deth while that ye may lyuen, for neuer\nshull ye comen to better pointe, and ther-fore haue   in mynde\nwhat ye be, ffor better is it for yow for to deffend youre- self manly than to be slayn shamefully in flight, for as me semeth\nwhiche wey that we turne ther nys but deth.\"  And whan thei\nherde her lorde thus speke thei returnede and fill to-gedir on a\ncompanye streite and close, that noon myght entre hem\nwithynne but a-noon he were slain.  And thus thei hem kepte\nwithoute remevynge, and suffred and endured till these other vpon\nhem hadde broke theire speres and till thei hadde a-gein recovered\nher breth; and so a-bode theire strokes that the to-ther were\nsomwhat wery and thei hem-self ther-with re-freisshed; and whan\nthei saugh the saisnes well chased and short wynded, thei lete\nrenne at hem and be-gonne to do soche maistries that the saisnes\nwere alle a-baisshed of the merveile that thei saugh hem\ndo.  And on the tother side dorilas faught so a-gein the peple of\nMaglaans that he droff hem a-wey discounfited, and made hem\nto rebounde vpon the warde of ffalsabres and vpon the warde of\nPyngnoras, that right sore faught agein the kynge ventres and\nhis peple, so that the ton smote thourgh the tothers\ncompanye.  Ther was a stour merveilouse and stronge bataile, and dured so\nlonge till it was euensonge tyme.  Than meved the kynged\nMargondes with grete plente of saisnes, for thei were more than xv Ml ,\nand he hadde grete dispite that so small a peple sholde endure so\nlonge agein so many as thei weren, for he saugh wele that thei\nwere not so manye by the haluendell as the saisnes.  Than Margondres cried to his men and comaunded hem that thei sholde\nsette so sore vpon the cristen that ther sholde leve noon in the\nfeilde a-live.  And whan the kynge ventres saugh comynge\na-gein hym so many saisnes, he gedered his men a-boute hym\nclose, and drough hym litill and litill towarde the foreste.  And\nthe saisnes hem hasted faste as thei wende haue all taken and\nconfounded, and vpon them they brake theire speres; and the\nkynge ventres and his meyne hadde gete the wode at her bakkes\nat a streite weye that was right depe, and the forest high on\nbothe sithes of the wey, and so thikke that nothinge might entre\nbut it were wilde bestes.  And the kynge ventres and Dorilas\nhaue hem so spedde that thei haue their men enbusshed in that\nstreite passage, and pight theire speres in the erthe, and the\nsharpe hede of steil vpwarde, and were well a-raied hem to\ndeffende.  And the saisnes com vpon hem in grete haste full\nwroth and angry for the grete damage that thei hadde don, and\nassailed hem right sore; and these hem deffended right vigerously\ntill that it was derke nyght that vnethe myght oon se a-nother;\nand more hadde the saisnes loste than wonne. Whan the kynge Ventres saugh the saisnes gon, than he and\nhis men rode forth all the nyght till thei come to\nwyndesore, and well it semed by their armes that thei hadde not\nsoiourned, ffor theire sheildes were hewen and to daissht, and\ntheire haubrekes rente in many places, and hem-self all be-soiled\nwith bloode, and her brondes of stiell croked and bente for the\nstrokes that thei hadde smyten, that for a merveile thei were\nbe-holden thourgh the town, and ech seide to other that these\npeple hadde not leyen at soiourne, and preide to god for hem\nbothe ladyes and maidenes in the chirches vpon theire knees and\nelbowes, that god sholde hem spede and defende fro deth.  And\nthise yede to theire loginges, and hem vn-armed, and wente to\nbedde, and rested hem, for longe hadde they waked.  And whan\nthei hadde slepte the mete was redy, and thei that myght ete\nyede to dyner.  But now cesseth to speke of hem a-while, and\nretourne to the kynge Brangore. Now seith the storye that whan the kynge Brangore was\ncome to Eastrangore, his stronge place, that he dide it\nstuffe with knyghtes and vitaile, that he hadde of oon and other\nxv Ml men; and longe he kepte wele the marches a-boute hym\nthat litill harme the saisnes dide.  Till on a tyme the saisnes\nwere entred in to the marche of Strangore and of south walis,\nwhere-of kynge Belynans was lorde, that was brother to the\nkynge Tradilyuaunt, that have herde spoken of be-fore.  And\nthis Belynans was a riche kynge, and hadde a riche contrey\nthat was feire and esy; and his wif was a feire yonge lady of\ngrete bewte, and her was Esclence, and she was doughter\nto kynge Natan de lille perdue, and hadde a childe be his nece\nthat was of grete bewte, and was xiiij yere of age, that was\ncleped by his right name, Dodynell the sauage.  And the cause\nwhi he was cleped Dodynell was for euer was in the feeldes\nand forestes for to hunte at the herte and other deer and wylde\nswyn, and for he haunted it so moche ther-fore, thei cleped hym\nDodynell the sauage.  And the kynge ventres was brother to his\nmoder Esclence, and Galaishin was cosyn to Dodynell on his\nmoder syde.  This Dodynell was after in the kynge house Arthur,\nand was a knyght of grete prowesse, and oon of the rounde\ntable, and oon of the most preised; but at this tyme we shall not\nspeke no more of hym, but speke of the kynge Brangore and of the\nsaisnes that be entred in to hys londe, and was wroth and sory for\nhis frendes that he hadde loste be-twene Arondell and the roche of\nsaisnes that heilde theire wey from wynsore be the castell of the\nstreyte wey; and thei were grete plente of peple; and as thei\npassed thourgh the contrey thei brente, and robbed, and wasted,\nand dide grete harme to the lordes of the weyes and to the\nlorde of the streite marche, and to the castellein of Wyndesore,\nand to the kynge Belynant of sought walis, and to the kynge\nBrangore more than eny other.  And whan he wiste it he gedered\nall his peple, and armed hem, and lepte to horse for to a-venge\nhem of the shame and of the harme that thei hem diden.  And\nthe saisnes com so many and so thikke that all the contrey was\nof hem covered the length of a walshe myle, that brent and slowe euer as thei come.  And on the tother syde the kynge Belynant\ncom ridynge with grete plente of peple till he com to the\nsaisnes that thus distroied the contrey and made soche martire of\nthe mene peple that men myght se the smolder of the fire x myle\nlonge, so trouble ther-of was the aire. Whan the kynge Brangore saugh the distruxion and the\ngrete martire, he toke ther-of grete pitee, and gan to\nwepe watir with his iyen, and than he requerid his men to haue\nin mynde to do well, and to defende holy cherche and the cristin\nfeith; and the saisnes com faste ridinge with baner sprad, and\nwere moo than fifty thousande, and hem condited Barahans, and\nCornyax, and lydarus, and hardrans, and kyngnenans.  These v\nkynges were riche and myghti, and eche of hem hadde in\ncompany x Ml , and alle were thei kyn to Aungis, that Vterpendragon\nslough; and whan the kynge Brangore sye the grete nombre of\nsaisnes, he merveiled fro whens alle myght come.  And than he\ngan to prey his men, and require to thynke vpon her worship and\nto do well her devers, and a-bode hem at a passage at a brigge\nther thei moste come ouer that lay ouer the river of arson, that\nwas brode and dep?? and as soone as thei were mette, thei lete\ntheire horse renne, and smyten harde to-geder the toon vpon the\ntother.  Ther was gret noise and crakkynge of speres, and many\noon throwe to grounde bothe horse and man, and that dured longe\ntill that thei come to the brigge, that may fill in to the water,\nand many a tronchon of speres and sheldes that the sharpe streme\nbar down the ryver, and it was not fully the houre of pryme. The booke seith that the river ran down be-fore Strangore\nthat the kynge Carados helde in his baile, and he was\nlenynge oute at the wyndowes of the paleise a-bove, and be-heilde\nthe medowes and the river, and the gardins that were grene\nflorisshed, and saugh the water that was clier and sharp\nrennynge brought down sheldes and speres fletynge grete foyson;\nand he loked that wey that he saugh it come fro, and saugh the\naire all troble of the fire and duste, and vpon the watir fletynge\nthe harneys of knyghtes and of horse that were deed and drowned,\nand dought a-noon how the kynge Brangore faught with the saisnes.  Than he lepe hastely vpon his feet, and cried to his\nmen, \"Now as armes, gentill knyghtes, ffor he that is not hardy\nat this nede is not worthi to be a knyght,\" and ther was a\nyonge squyre that was noble and hardy that brought the kynge\nhis armes.  This squyer was cleped Kay destranx, this squyer\nhadde ofte Carados somoned to be a knyght, and he seide that\nther-to hadde he no talent, and that he seide for he purposed to\nserue the kynge Arthur, and to take of hym the ordre of\nknyght.  Whan the kynge was armede, he asked yef alle the other knyghtis\nwere redy, and thei seide how alle were an horse bakke a-bidynge\nwith-oute the yates.  And than the kynge asked his horse, and\nther-on lepte and rode oute of the town a grete spede, and come\nto the bataile a-boute mydday.  And whan thei come nygh thei\nherde the noise and the strokes at the passage of the brigge, ffor\nthe kynge Brangore with-stode hem with xv Ml men, and the\nsaisnes were so many and so thikke that of fin force thei made\nhym to remeve fro the brigge in to the playn feelde; but than\nsholde soone the kynge Brangore haue hadde grete losse, but as\nthe kynge Carados com in fresshe with x Ml men and leide in\na-monge hem fercely; and ther be-gan the stoure to encrese right\nharde, and grete mortalite of the saisnes, for thei were not alle\nright wele armed, and so thei foughten all the day, fro that it\nwas passed noone till evensonge, and than disparbled the cristin,\nfor thei were so sore over-leide with grete multitude of saisnes;\nand than a-roos the shoute and the noise so grete, that iiij myle\nof a man myght haue herde the sounde.  But longe myght not\nthe men of kynge Brangore ne of kynge Carados endure, but as\nthe kynge Belynans com with viij Ml men of armes wele horsed,\nthat ronne in a-monge hem fiercely, that made hem remove and\ndeparte.  Whan the kynge Belynans com to the bataile, as was\ngrete nede to the kynge Brangore and to the kynge Carados, ffor\nthei were so distrussed that thei were euen at flight; but whan\nBelynans com he smote so fiercely vpon hem that these other\ncristin myght well recouer be goode leyser, for with the kynge\nBelynans were many goode men and noble knyghtes, ffor ther\nwas the lorde of Wyndesore and the lorde of the streite marche, and the Castelein of Glocedon and the Castelein of Galeince, and\nof the more, and of Rostok, and ther was Carados of the dolerouse\ntoure, and ther was drias le gais of the forest perilouse, and eche\nof these hadde in his companye CC knyghtes of the beste of the\nlonde, and thei slough and made soche martire of the saisnes that\nthe river of arson be-com all reade of the blode and of the brayn\nthat was ther sheed of men and of horse, and hadde not the nyght\ncome on so soone ther hadde neuer a-schaped a-wey saisne, and\nthei were moo than fifti thousande, and of the cristen ne were\nbut xxxiij Ml ; but the nyght com that made hem departe, and eche\npartye drought fer from other, till on the morowe that thei wolde\nbe-gynne a-gein to fight, but the counseile of the kynge of\nSaxoyne, the saisnes traueiled all nyght to-warde the roche, but\nmoche thei loste of her harneys, for thei hasted hem so faste oute\nof the contrey, that thei hadde not with hem the half of her\nthinges, and thus lefte it till on the morowe that it was day, and\nthan com the kynge Carados, and the kynge Belynans, and the\nkynge Brangore, whan thei were redy armed, and alle the barouns\nof theire companye were come to deffende the cristin feith, ffor\nther were many full noble men and trewe that hadden grete drede\nthat for the faute of her prowesse that holy cherche and cristin\nfeith were disavaunced; and thei renged and set their batailes in\nordenaunce, and rode that wey as thei trowed to mete their\nenmyes, but whan thei founde that thei were goon, thei were\nsorye and wroth that thei were so ascaped, ffor well thei wiste\nthat thei were gon to the Castell of Vandesbyry, and whan thei\nsaught it myght be noon other thei returned, and eche lorde\nmade to other grete ioye and feeste, and departed togeder the\nrichesse that was lefte be-hynde of the saisnes in soche maner\nthat eche toke that hym liked, so that the moste pore of hem\nwas riche I-nowgh. And at theire departinge a-sonder, eche promysed other theire\nseruyse yef nede were, and eche of hem sholde lete other\nwite whan thei hadde eny mystere.  And the kynge Carados\nrepeired hom to his stronge place; and the kynge Brangore rode\nto Estrangore, that was a goode town and a riche and full of goode Burgeises, and dwelled ther in pees and in ioye longe tyme;\nand than com tidinges that the sones of kynge loot hadde lefte\ntheire fader, and were go to logres to serue the kynge Arthur,\nand the sone of kynge Ventres and the sones of kynge\nVrien.  And whan Dodynell herde these tithinges, he seide to hym-self\nthat he wolde do the same wise, and tolde to his prevy counseile\nthat he wolde go to court; and than he ordeyned to be redy in\nthe pryveest maner that he myght, and sente to seche kay destranx\nwith the kynge Carados his oncle, and sent hym worde to speke\nwith hym at Thorne Castell, and that he faile not in no wise to\ncome and bringe with hym his nevew kehedin.  The Messager\ntoke leve, and rode till he come to strangore, and fonde kay, and\nseide to hym in counseile as Dodynell hadde hym comaunded,\nand that he sholde com to speke with hym at the Castell of the\nthorn, araiede redy to ride on his iourne.  And he ansuerde\nthat he sholde be ther redy with-ynne the thirde day.  Than the\nmessenger toke leve of kay destranx, and com to Dodynell the\nsauage, and tolde hym the ansuere of kay destranx.  And whan\nDodinell herde what the messenger hadde seide, he vndirstode\na-noon what that kay ment, and made hym redy, and warned his\nfelowes as many as he myght haue, that thei were well xxiiij\nalle yonge bachelers of xiiij or xv yere of age, and com to the\nCastell of Thorn, he and his companye richely be seyn of golde\nand siluer and robes, and ther a-bode till kay com and his nevew\nkehedin li bens.  And thei brought in her companye xl yonge\ngentilmen that alle were bolde and hardy.  Whan the childeren\nwere mette thei made to-geder grete ioye the ton to the tother as\nthei that longe tyme ne hadde not mette.  And than seide\nDodinell, \"Feire frende kay, I sente to yow for to come speke with\nme, and I thanke yow that ye be now I-come, and I shall telle\nyow the cause.  I haue herd tydinges that Gawein and Agrauain,\nand Gaheret, and Gaheries, and Galashin, and Ewein ben gon to\nthe courte of kynge Arthur for to take theire armes, and\ntherfore I will go in the same manere; and I love yow so moche that\nI will nought do with-oute youre leve, and that ye haue ther-of\nwytinge; and ther-fore sey youre advise yef ye will come also, for to my fader I will not returne in no manere, ffor I haue made\nredy all my purpos and am vpon my weye.\"  \"Sir,\" quod\nkay, \"and ther-fore am I come to yow, ffor I supposed in partye\nwhat ye ment, and I haue me so purveied that me nedeth for\nnothinge returne, ffor I haue in my companye iiij yonge gentilmen\nthat be right hardy, and heire is also my nevew kehedin; and\nther-fore lete us meve whan ye like.\"  \"Ye say well,\" seide\nDodinell, \"for we shull meve to-morowe be-tyme.\"  Thus a-bode\nthe childeren all that nyght in grete ioye, and erly on the morowe\nthei toke theire wey be the moste prive and disvsed weyes that\nthei wiste, and wente to logres in this manere.  But of hem\ncesseth the tale and returneth to the kynge Clarion of\nNorthumbirlonde. Now seith the booke that the kynge Clarion of\nNorthumbirlonde hadde gadered alle the peple that he myght, and he\nstuffed well his Citee with vitaile and with men of armes, and\nafter he sente thurgh all his londe to hem that hadde oxen or\nsheep or lambe, or eny other bestes, that thei sholde hem lede in\nto the depe of the forestes, that were wilde and sauage.  And\nthei dide as he hem comaunded, and sente with hem hierdes for\nto kepe the bestes.  And whan thei hadde alle thus do, alle the\nthat myght bere armes or wepen defensable drowgh to the kynge\nin Northumbirlonde, and thei were counted xiiij Ml , and gretly\npeyned the kynge to kepe well the contrey, and lay many nyghtes\nin the forestes to wayte vpon the passages, and a-noon as he myght\ntake eny asspye he lete hym take and put in prison. Upon a day the saisnes were assembled at the tente of kynge\nBrangu of Saxoyne, and at the teynte of Maglaas the\nriche kynge of Iselonde, that was cosyn germain to the kynge\nof Denmark and brother to amadas, the riche kynge of Ostrich\nand of a pertie of Denmarke A small part of the MS. is here burnt out. and of Iselonde was he lorde.  And\nther thei complayned gretly of the losse and the damage A small part of the MS. is here burnt out. that the\ncristin hadde doon hem at the Castell de la roche, and the harme\nthat thei dide euery day; and on the tother side thei playned gretly for defaute of vitaile that was scant in the hoste.  Than\nsterte vp a yonge knyght vpon his feet, that was bolde and hardy\nas of his age, and spake so high that he myght wele be herde, and\nseide, \"Ha! Brangue, feire oncle, yef ye will suffre me to go on\nforrey in to a londe that I knowe, I shall bringe yow vitaile\nplente, for the contre is full of all goode; and I shall take with\nme soche of youre peple as I shall chese, yef nunadus my fader\nwill suffre that I goo, and maglaans myn oncle, for with-oute\ntheire leve I will not go in no manere.\"  \"Ffeire nevewe,\"\nseide the kynge Brangue, \"I here yow sey nothinge but well of\nthis that ye desire to vndirtake; but telle me now be- fore in to\nwhat londe desire ye for to go.\"  \"That shall I wele telle yow,\"\nseide Orienx, \"I desire to go in to Northumbirlonde, and to the\nyates of the Citee of Cambenek, and witeth it wele that it is the\nplentevousest contrey of this londe, and yef we shull fynde eny\nvitaile in this londe ther shull we haue plente.\"  \"And I grante\nyow, feire nevewe,\" seid Brangue, \"and ther-for cheseth with\nyow soche as yow pleseth.\"  \"Sir,\" seide he,\n\"gramercy.\"  Than Orienx chese oute of peple as many as hym liked, that were\nwele xl Ml with-outen the petaile that after hem folowed, that\ndesired the wynnynge, and com right be-fore Norham, and robbed\nand brent and distroied the londe; but of hem I shall stinte, and\ntelle of the parliament that kynge Brangue heilde. Whan that Orienx was departed fro the hoste, the kynge\ncleped Sorioundes, his nevew, and seide, \"Feire cosin,\nhow is it that ye will not go no wey.  Take of my men as many\nas ye will, and go in to the londe of kynge ydiers, of Cornewaile,\nand brynge with yow thens what yow liketh, and yef any man\nyow with-stonde, take with yow soche peple that ye take of hem\nvengeaunce.\"  And whan he herde his oncle thus speke he lepe\non his feet gladde and mery, for he was of grete prowesse, and\nseide, \"Sire, gramercy.\"  Than he chese at his volunte in the\nhoste xl Ml , and whan thei were redy thei to theire wey towarde\ncornewaile, and robbed the londe as thei wente, and distroied-the\ncontrey and brente.  But of hem ne speketh the boke no more yet\na while, but speketh of the parliament in the hoste of saisnes. Now whan Sorioundes, that was the nevew of maglaans, was\ndeparted oute of the hoste as ye haue herde, that Mynadus,\nthe kynge, called hurtant, his nevew, and side, \"Hurtant, nevew,\nye moste go in to leonoys, and in to Orcanye, in to the londes of\nkynge loot, and take with yow of my men at youre wille, and\nloke that ye do so, that I maye conne yow thonke.\"  And he\nlepte vpon foote and seide, \"Sir, gramercy,\" and toke soche\ncompany as hym liste; and whan thei were redy thei were lx Ml ,\nand rode till thei come in to the londes of kynge loot, and\nbegonne to waste and distroie all that thei myght.  But here leventh\nto speke more of hem and returneth agein to Br A small portion of the MS. is here burnt out. angue , and\nMaglaans, and mynadus and other. Whan Orienx, and Sorioundes, and hurtant were thus\ndeparted fro the hoste as ye haue herde, the hethen kynges\nhelde a gret parliament how thei sholde take the town of\nvandesbiry that was so stronge, ffor the booke seith that it stode\nvpon a plain grounde, ne ther was nother hill ne mounteyne ny\nit of two myle, and it was well diked, large, and well watered,\nand depe, and the marysse grete and brode of a bowe shot, and\nbe-twene the town and the diche stode the walles, and the towres\nof ston en-batailed rigth thikke, and in to the town were but two\nentrees, and at eche entre two porte colyses and stronge yates\ncovered with Iren nailed, that shet with the two leves well and\nstrongly barred.  Wher-to sholde I longe devise yow the strenghe of the town, ffor ther-to it sat so esely vpon the river that com\nrennynge vpon the oon side of the town be-twene the drie londe\nand the maras, and envirouned the contrey on alle parties, that the\ntown myght not be made drie but on that oon part, and on that\nsyde were two paire diches so depe and brode, and the maras so\nbrode and depe as an arblast myght shete, and on that side was\nthe grete seege of saisnes, that it lasted more than iiij myle, and\nthei wente be-holdynge on whiche side thei myght it beste take\nand in what manere, and ther-of thei toke amonge hem grete\ncounseile how thei sholde do, ffor thei saugh that it myght not be wonne but by famyn.  Ther was a knynge that was hight\nMargoundres, that dressed hym vpon his feet and seide to the kynge\nBrangue, \"Sir, sir, me semeth than that ye most be so longe in this\nlonde that the town be take be famyn, and in the tyme that we\nly be-fore this town ther may be taken a-nother town other be\nfamyn or be other engyne, for as soone shall we take tweyne as\noon.\"  \"Trewly,\" quod Maglaans, \"ye sey trouth, and ther-fore\nwho that will assent to my counseile let vs sende the thirde part\nof oure peple be-fore the town of Clarence, and alle tho that come\noute of oure contrey shull go with hem to the seege, ffor in this\nreame is not the fowrthe part of the peple to oure that myght vs\nremeve from that place.\" \"Sir,\" quod Brangue, \"who shall go with yow?  a-corde ye\nwho shall go.\"  \"That shall I well telle yow,\" quod\nMynadus the kynge.  \"Ther shall go thider the kynge\nhardogobrans, and the kynge Synagons, and the kynge Sorbares, and\nthe kynge Margoundres, and the kynge Maglaans, and the kynge\nMycenes, and the kynge Pyngres, and the kynge Saphirus, and\nthe kynge Thoas, and the kynge Semptipres, and the kynge\nPlantamore, and the kynge Sonygrex, and the kynge Mathucus,\nand eche of these haue at his baner xx Ml men, and holde the\nseege be-fore the town that noon entre ne isse oute.\"  And this\nwas the ende of her counseile, and to this thei be alle a-corded;\nand than thei a-raide hem meny and rode to the town of Clarence,\nand distroied all the contrey a-boute as thei wente, and whan\nthei were come be-fore Clarence thei pight teintes and pavilouns\nalle a-boute the town, and a-bode there right longe.  But resteth\nthe processe of hem till efte soone, and speketh of kynge Clarion,\nof Northumbirlonde. Whan the kynge Clarion saugh hem distroie his londe and\nhis contrey he was right wroth, and he toke aspie and\nsente hym to wite yef thei were grete plente of peple, and whan\nhadde hem alle sein he returned gretly affraied, and seide to the\nkynge that thei were moo than fifty thousande.  Whan the kynge\nherde these tidinges he toke a damesell and sente to the Duke\nEscam, of Cambanyk, and sente hym worde to mete with hym at the streite of the roche magot, vpon the river of Sauarne, with\nas moche peple as he myght assemble, ffor the saisnes be entred\nin to the londe that alle distroieth.

MERLIN'S JOURNEY TO LOGRES AND VISIT TO GAWEIN. ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND ORIENX. Full grete was the ioye that thei ledde in the town of Toraise\nfor the victorie and the wynnynge that thei hadde vpon\ntheire enmyes, and thei a-bode theire peple thet assembled euery\nday on euery part, and the kynge Arthur ther was full richely\nserueved and honoured of the kynge leodegan and of his doughter,\nthat moche her peyned, be the commaundement of hir fader, and vpon a day as the kynge Arthur was moche worshiped and in\ngrete ese.  Than Merlin com and toke the thre kynges apart and\nseide, \"Sirs, I moste go in the reame of logres, for ther is\nnow grete nede of counseyle and of helpe, nought for that the\nlonde hath eny perile, but that it shall well be deffended from\neuell doers, and I do yow to wite that the princes and the barouns\nbeth moche greved with the saisnes that to many haue in her\nlondes, and thei haue be-seged two Citees thourgh her pride,\nwherof that oon is vandesberes and the tother is Clarence, and\nther be assembled the peple of moo than xl dyuerse regiouns, and\nyet thei encrece euery day more and more; and more than he hem\ntolde how that the saisnes were departed, and how that oon part\nyede vpon the kynge of Cornewaile, and the tother upon the\nkynge loot, and the thirde vpon the kynge Clarion and the Duke\nEscam, and after that the tolde hem alle the tidinges, and alle the\nbatailes, and all the trouble that hadde I-be, and all the\ndiscounfitures be-twene the saisnes and cristin kynges, and the\ngrete parliament that the saisnes heilden for to a-sege the two\ntownes, and how Ewein the grete and Ewein the a-voutres were\ndeparted fro kynge vrien her fader, and how Dodinell the sauage,\nand kay destranx, and keheden lebens com on the tother side\ntowards logres to a-bide ther with Gawein, and seide how thei\nwolde neuer be cleped knyghtis vn-to the tyme that the kynge\nArthur hem girde with her swerdes, and I do yow to wete that\nthei may not endure but thei haue other counseile than her\nowne, ffor the saisnes be so spredde a-boute thourgh the londe that\nthei shull be take but thei haue better counseile but hem-self, and\nthat is the cause that I will go, and loke that ye be mery and\nwell at ese, and resteth yow that ye go nothir hider ne thider\ntill that ye se me, and I shall not longe tarye.\" \"Ha, feire frende,\" seide the kynge Ban, \"ne a-bide not longe,\nfor than sholde we alle be deed and distroied, yef ye vs\nnow for-sake we myght sey that ye hadde vs alle\nbe-traied.\"  \"How is that, feire lordes?  haue ye doute that I sholde not\ncome a-gein?  now be-war that neuer ye it thinke, for than haue\nye loste my love.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the knyge Ban, \"I thenke it for noon evell that I haue of yow, but for to haue your companye\nthat I so moche love.\"  \"Now lete it be,\" quod Merlin, \"for ye\nshull me haue here a-gein with yow er than ye haue bataile in\nthis reame, and therfore I yow comaunde to god, for I may here\nno lenger tarien;\" and with that he departed so sodeynly thens\nthat thei knewe not where he was be-come.  And that he com\nthe same nyght to Blase his maister in Northumbirlonde, that\ngrete ioye hym made whan he hym saugh as he that loved moche\nhis companye.  And Merlin tolde hym alle these aventures that\nwere be-fallen in the reme of Tamelide seth that he departed;\nand after that he tolde hym alle thinges that were fallen to the\nkynges of the reame of grete Bretaigne, that nought he lefte\nvn-tolde; and he wrote in hys booke worde for worde like as he\nhym tolde; and by hym haue we the knowinge ther-of in to this\ntyme.  And whan he hadde alle these thinges writen, thanne he\ntolde hym for what nede he hadde lefte the thre kynges in the\nreame of Tamelide.  And the same nyght that Merlin spake thus\nwith Blase was Orienx and his meyne logged vpon the river of\nhumbir, enteringe in the londe; but now resteth the processe\nof Merlin and of Blase a-while, and of the saisnes, and speketh\nof Seigramor, that is departed fro Costantynnoble with CCC\nfelowes for to be made knyghtes of kynge Arthurs honde. Now seith the booke of Blase that so hath Seigramor hym\nspedde seth that he departed fro the riche Citee of\nCostantynnoble, that he com to the port of hucent that thei a-rived\nat the port of Dover; and whan thei were alle come to the londe\nthei were right gladde, and trussed theire harneys, and lepe on\ntheire horse, and toke theire wey toward Kamelot, and iourneyed\nso as thei that knewe not the weyes, ne fonde not of whom to\nasked after the kynge Arthur, and fonde also the contrey brent\nand wasted as the saisnes hadde passeth thourgh; and the\nchilderen ne wiste no worde till sodeinly thei blusshed vpon a grete\nparte of saisnes that Orienx hadde desseuered on a companye, and\nwere xx Ml , and went robbinge a-boute Norhant, that noon hem ne\nletted of the pray that theire peple hadde gadered.  Whan these\nchilderen a-proched the saisnes with-ynne a myle, thei mette with peple of the contrey that fledde to the wode for drede, for\nin the londe was grete sorow and desese in tho dayes.  Whan the\nchilderen hem mette thei asked what hem eiled, and thei hem\ntolde that thei fledde for the saisnes that all the contre\ndistroied.  And than Seigramor asked, \"Where is the kynge\nArthur?\"  And thei ansuerde that he was gon to the reame of\nTamelide.  \"And who is than in this londe?\" quod Seigramor.  Than seide\nthe men of the contrey that the sone of kinge loot of Orcanye,\nthat were nevewes of kynge Arthur, were come for to serue for to\ntake theire armes of kynge Arthur.  \"And where ben thei?\"\nquod Seigramor.  \"At Camelot,\" seide thei, \"but for goddes\nlove, feire gentill knyghtes, ne go not ferther, for than shull\nye alle be slain and distroied.\"  \"Now,\" quod Seigramor,\n\"telle vs what wey stondeth Camelot.\"  \"Trewly,\" seiden\nthei, \"ye be right well in the wey, yef it ne were for these\nfalse sarazins that here be comynge, and, ther-fore, fleeth, or\nye be alle deed.\"  \"How fer is it hens to Camelot?\" quod\nSeigramor.  \"Sir, it is vj mile vnto a plain that dureth wele\ntwo myle fro thens.\"  Whan Seigramor vndirstode that he\nhadde but viij myle, he cried to his felowes, and seide, \"Gentill\nsquyers, now as armes, for now shall be sein who is noble and\nworthi; and loke that thise mysbelevinge saisnes that thus\ndistroieth the cristin feith ne bere nought a-wey of youres be\nforce but it be dere solde, ffor yef we may passe hem thourgh\nand gete be-twene hem and Camelot, we shull than come thider\nbe strengthe of oure horse yef we haue grete mystere.\"  Than\na-light the squyers and hem armed.

And than\nthei hem renged clos on a sop as starlinges, and rode forth toward\nthe saisnes, that saugh hem comynge; but now a litill resteth\nof hem and speketh of Merlyn, that was in Northumberlonde\nwith Blase. Whan Merlin hadde tolde to Blase alle the merveiles of the\nlonde as thei were fallen seth he departed from\nhym.  In the morowe erly he com be-fore the town of Camelot.  And he\ncom in the semblaunce of an olde man, and hadde on a russet\ncote torne and all thredebare; and he was moche and longe and\ncourbed, and brode sholderes and leene for age, and the heer of\nhis heede entermedled white and broun, and longe berde, and bar\na grete staff on his nekke, and drof gret foyson of beestes be-fore\nhym.  And whan he com be-fore the town he be-gan to make\ngrete sorow, and cried high and cleer that thei with-ynne vpon\nthe walles myght wele it here how he yede, seyinge, \"Ha,\nlorde god, how grete pite is it that so feire children shull thus be\nslayn and alle to hewen with wronge and grete\nsynne.

And Gawein hadde wele herde and vndirstonde\nthe wordes that the karll hadde seide.  Than Gawein hym cleped\nwith an high voyse, and siede, \"Man! man! com hedir, and\nspeke with me, and tell vs what thow eylest, and whi thow\nmakest this sorow, and telle vs who is that that thow goist thus\nregratynge and be-monynge.\"  And the carll leide to the deef\nere and smote his staff on the grounde as he hadde ben oute of his\nmynde, for grete sorow that he hadde at his herte; and than he lenyd hym vpon his staff and be-gan to make grete sorowe; and\nwhan he hadde thus hym longe waymented, he drof a-gein his bestes\nas though he wolde haue fledde to the forest; and than he seide\na-gein with an high voyce, \"A! haa! chiualrie of logres, where\nart thow be-come, ffor with-ynne these viij dayes men seide ther\nwas come in to this contrey all the socoure of the worlde, and I\nherde sey that the nevewes of kynge Arthur sholde defende this\ncontrey; certeys euell it sheweth whan he suffreth to be slain the\nmerveile of the worlde.\"  Whan that Gawein vndirstode these\nwordes he was right angwisshouse for to knowe whi the carll\nhadde this seide, and whi he so waymented and cleped hym a-gein\nwith a lowde voyce thre or foure tymes, and seide, \"Howe,\nkarll, howe? speke to me and telle me what thow eilest.\"  And\neuer he turned the heed in trauers, and made semblant as he\nhadde hym not herde; and Gawein hym cleped efte soones, and\nthan he lefte vp his heed that was lothly and rivelid, and loked\non high to hym with oon eye open and a-nother clos, and\ngrennynge with his teth as a man that loked a-gein the sonne, and\nansuerde, \"What wilt thow?\"  Quod Gawein, \"Come a litill\nnerre and speke with me.\"  And he drought ner till he com vndir\nthe walles of the town vpon the diche, and seide, \"Now maist\nthow sey what thow wilt, but sey hastely, for my bestes gon.\"\n\"I will,\" quod Gawein, \"that thow telle whi that thow wepest,\nand what he is that thow hast thus regreted, and whi thow hast\nso blamed the Chyualrie of this contrey.\"  \"Yef thow wilt\ngraunte me that thow shalt do thi power to delyuer hym I will\ntelle the.\"  \"I the graunte,\" quod Gawein, \"as I am trewe\nsquyer, that I shall ther-to do all my myght that I haue in the\nworlde.\"  And whan the karll herde that Gawein was so\ndesirouse for to wite whi he was come thider, he seide to Gawein,\n\"Feire sir, what be ye?\"  \"My name,\" quod he, \"is Gawein,\nthe nevew of kynge Arthur.

Now haue I seide all that I knowe; but I knowe it\nwell that ye will not hym socoure, and so I haue loste my laboure,\nffor I knewe well that ye haue not the herte ne the hardynesse\nfor to go thider.  Netherdeles, yef ye go thider and ye may hym\nsocoure, ye may yow a-vaunte that ye haue wonne a feire emprise\nand a riche.\" Whan Gawein vndirstode the wordes of the karll that so\nhym cleped cowarde, he was a-shamed, and cried, \"Now\nto horse, gentill knyghtes and gentill felowes ,   and sue me for I\ngo.\"  And as sone as he hadde seide that worde he lepe to horse\nand alle his felowes after, and rode oute of the town in all haste;\nand whan thei were alle oute thei were iiij Ml what oon what\nother.  And Gawein com all be-fore, and come to the karll and\nseide, \"Lepe vpon this horse, and lede vs ther these childeren\nfighten.\"  Ant the karll dide his comaundement, that for noon\nother thinge was come theder, and rode formest ther as thei were\nfightynge; and whan thei neyhed nygh thei founde the childeren\nfightinge merveilously, and hadde slain of the saisnes moo than\nvijC, but ther were so many of hem that thei myght not longe\nendure; and ther dide Seigramor the grettest prowesse that eny\nman saught euer, ffor he heilde an axe with bothe hondes, and\nwas be-fore his felowes vpon a stede that was swyfte and right\nstronge, ffor whan thei gan hym assaile he smote in a-monge hem\nso harde and so depe that he was loste as it hadde be in a see\nfrom the sight of his felowes; and the saisnes hym enclosed on\nalle sides, and Seigramor, that heilde the ax that was sharp\nI-grounde, thought to perce thourgh to his felowes, he smote so\ngrete strokes on bothe sides that he slowgh all that he raught a\nfull stroke, and thei fledde on euery side from hym that knewen\nhis strokes, and noon was so hardy that durst hym a-byde, but launched to hym sharpe grounde speres and gleyves and other\nwepnes; but thus myght thei not longe endure that thei ne\nsholde haue be deed or elles taken, but as Gawein com with his\ncompanye, ffor Orienx payned hym moche hem for to take that\nwas a noble knyght and a sure; and he sette vpon the\nchilderen and kepte hem in so short and streite that noon myght\npasse, and foughten so felly that the childeren were waxen feble\nfor lakke of breth, and yef it ne hadde be for Seigramor only\nther hadde noon of hem ascaped.  But his defence was so grete\nall a-boute hym that merveile it was how he myght it endure;\nbut in the ende a-vailed litill the well doynge of hym or eny\nother ne hadde Gawein come soone with his companye of yonge\nbachelers.  And as Gawein com to the stronge stour the\nchilderen were in gret mischief; and than he and his felowes spronge\nvpon hem so sharply that at the first shofte thei threw of hem to\ngrounde mo than two thousande.  And of that was Orienx\nsorowfull, ffor neuer hadde he sein so fewe peple so well hem\ncontene; and he heilde a stronge spere and the heed sharp\nI-grounde, and rode in the renge formest, and seide he wolde be\na-venged on hem that hadde hym wratthed.  And Gawein hadde\nso smyten a-boute hym on euery side that he fonde the childeren\nfull wery for travaile, and saugh Seigramor, that was a-fore in\nthe fronte, and hielde an axe in bothe handes wher-with he smote\ngrete strokes out of mesure.  And he was moche and semly, and\nther-to the beste shapen chielde to have sought thourgh eny\nreame, and whom that he a-raught was hitte so harde that it\nwarant neither Iren ne stiell ne noon armour that he ne smot\nthourgh owther arme or sholder or thigh or other member, and\nshewde merveiles all a-boute.  And whan Gawein saugh all this\nhe asked of the olde man that was by hym what he was.  And\nhe seide it was Seigramor, the nevew of the Emperour of\nCostantinnoble; but helpe hym delyuerly, for it is grete\nmyster.  Than Gawein renged his companye, and lete renne at hem so\nfiercely that in her comynge thei threwe to grounde of the\nsaisnes grete plente, deed and wounded thourgh with sharpe\nwepenes.  Grete was the bataile a-gein Orienx of the chylderen, but at grete myschief thei were, for on Gaweins side were but\niiij Ml and thre hundred that Seigramor hadde brought, and of the\nsaisnes were xx Ml , with-oute hem that ronne thourgh the contrey\nthat brente and robbed, of whiche were xl Ml .  Whan that Orienx\nsaugh that so small a peple with-stode hym so felly, he hadde\nther-of grete dispite, and cried to his men, and swor that in euell\ntyme sholde eny ascape he caught, and com drivinge agein\nAgrauain, that oon of his nevewes hadde slain be-fore his\niyen. And whan Orienx saugh that, he spored his steede and smote\nAgrauain vpon the shelde, that he perced through the\nplites of his haubreke vndir the side, that the spere hede shewed\non the tother side, and he shof ther-on so sore that he bar hym\nfrom his horse to the grounde.  Whan Gawein saugh his brother\nfalle he hadde grete drede leste that he hadde be deed, and he\nheilde a trenchant axe and come to the saisne that hadde him\nvn-horsed, and wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, but whan\nOrienx saugh the stroke come he it douted, and couered hym\nwith his shielde, and Gawein hym smote that the axe bente and\nslit the sheilde in two, the stroke was grete, and Orienx spored\nhis horse forth, the stroke descended vpon the helme and kut the\ncercle and a quarter of the helme, and the mayle of the haubreke\nbe-hynde, and the horse chyne a-sonder, that he blusht  to the\ngrounde, and Gaheries smote so Solunant thourgh the heed with\nan axe that ded he drof to the erthe, and Gaheret smote Vabibre\nthourgh the helme that he slit hym to the teth, and Galashin\nsmote Pinados that the heed fley in to the feilde. Whan the saisnes saugh Orienx lye at the grounde thei hadde\ngrete drede that he hadde be deed, and shof alle to the\nrescewe ther a-boute hym environ, and bar hym oute of the presse\nin to the feilde, but he was stonyed of the stroke that he myght\nnot stonde on his feet ne meve no membre that he hadde, and\nther-to he made so lotly chere and so hidouse semblant, that alle\nwende he hadde ben deed, and made a-monge hem grete doell and\nwepynge that all the bataile lefte, and the childeren haue\nAgravain taken vp ther he was fallen and set hym on horse, and the karll that hadde brought thider Gawein hadde chaunged his forme\nto a-nother, and hadde take the semblance of a knyght armed,\nand than com to Gawein and to his other bretheren and seide,\n\"Feire lordes, yef ye do be my counseile, lete vs take the wey\nnow right towarde Camelot while these saisnes entende to make\nthis sorowe.\"  Whan Gawein vndirstode these wordes, he wiste\nwele his counseile was wise and with-oute trecherie, and com\na-noon to Seigramore and seide he was right welcome and his\ncompanye, and he a-gein hym salude as deboner and curteys, and\nthan he seid, \"Ha! seigramor, feire frende, it is tyme now that\nwe go and lede with vs the peple that is vs be lefte, for I-nough\nhaue we wonne seth that saf and sounde we repeyre.\"  Than\nSeigramor asked what he was that so spake vn-to hym, and he\nseide, \"My name is Gawein, the nevew of kynge Arthur, and the\nsone of kynge loot of Orcanye, and kepe the londes of myn oncle,\nI and my bretheren, till he be come from Tamelide, and we be\ncome hider for not elles but yow for to helpe and to socoure, ffor\nin the morowe it was tolde how ye were assailed of the saisnes\nright sore.\" Than com forth the knyght that hadde spoke to Gawein, and\ncried, \"A! Gawein, feire sir, what a-bide ye that ye come\nnot forthe youre wey; se not ye that all the worle of peple\ncometh vpon vs, wherefore we may not ascape yef ye a-bide?\"\nWhan Gawein herde hym so haste to garison, he be-heilde and\nsaugh come so grete plente of saisnes, and so grete foison, that\nalle the feilde was couered, and thei were alle armed, and com\nrydinge fiercely, and made soche noyse and soche murmur, that\na myle of lengthe it myght haue ben herde, and whan that Gawein\nsaugh the saisnes come in soche maner, he seide to Seigramor,\n\"Sir, and hit ples yow gowe hens.\"  And he hym ansuerde and\nseide, \"With goode will.\"  And thei than rode forth toward\nCamelot clos to-geder and streite, that ye myght haue caste a\nglove ouer her hedes covered vndir steill; and the saisnes yet\nentended to Orienx makynge grete doell and sorowe, but\nwithynne a while a-roos the saisne fro disturdison, and saugh hem\na-boute hym made grete sorowe and hevynesse.  Than he asked a newe helme and sheilde and spere, for he was of grete herte and\na goode knyght and hardy as of his age, and he swore yef he\nmyght with hym that yaf hym that acooley whereof he hadde so\nleyen in swowne at erthe, he sholde it hym wele a-quyte, and than\nhe lepe to horse that was stronge and swyfte rennynge, and rode\nthat wey as he wende to haue hem founden, but thei were go\nthens a myle.  Whan Orienx saugh hem gon in this maner, he\ncried his ensigne and seide, \"Now after hem,\" and than he swore\nthat noon of hem sholde ascape.  Than pressed forth the saisnes\nhastely alle that myght, that oon ne a-bode not a-nother, and the\nshoute and the noyse a-roos so grete that wonder it was to here,\nand the duste and the powder a-roos so thikke that the clier air\nwas trouble, and thei com drivinge on so faste that thei nyghed\nnygh to atteyne the cristin; and than the knyght that hadde yeve\nGawein this counseile saugh hem come so faste, he hasted sore\nGawein and alle the tother for to go faste, and spake vnto hem\nthat thei rode a gretter paas; but er thei com to the town of\nCamelot thei were sore hasted.  But the noble Gawein and\nAgravain and Gaheret and Gaheries and Galaishin and Seigramor were\nthe laste, and sente in theire felowes and her peple, and her\nharneys be-fore, as the heirde driveth his bestes to pasture, and\nther while thei suffred the saisnes to breke theire speres, and\nwhan thei saugh eny of her felowes ouer charged, thei hem\ndelyuered at her power as thei that were of high prowesse, and\nthei dide so well, that ther nas saisne so hardy that durste that\nwey go, wher as thei were ne of hem a-bide a stroke.  Than com\nOrienx with the grete baner, and hadde a grete spere, whereof\nthe heed is sharp and trenchaunt, and saugh hym that hadde hym\nsmyte to grounde, and knewe hym full well, and swoor by his\ngod that he wolde be a-venged; than he spored his horse fiercely,\nand the chielde saugh hym come, but he made semblaunt as ther-of\nhe rought litill, and whan he com even at the metynge Gawein\nlefte the wey and lete hym passe forth, that his horse cowde\nnot restreyne, and Gawein, that was wight and delyuer, returned his horse vpon hym, and smote hym vpon the heed with bothe\nhondes, but it was with the flat, for the haste that he hadde hym\nto smyte, so that he wiste not how he it heilde, and the stroke\nwas so grete and hevy that the fier sparkled vp in the aire and\na-stoned hym so sore that he fill flat to the erthe, and Seigramor\nsmote Driant the rede thurgh the sholder so harde that it\ndisseuered fro the body, and Galaishin smote so Placidas that his heed\nhe hym be-rafte, and Agrauain and Gaheret and Gaheries hadde\neche of hem caught a short spere, the Iren sharp and trenchaunt,\nand that oon smote Gynebant, and the tother Taurus, and the\nthridde smote ffannell, that eche bar his to the erthe from theyre\nhorse all blody, and with the same cours thei smote thre other;\nand Gawein and Galaishin and Seigramor rested vpon Orienx, for\nthei wolde hym haue take yef thei myght, but the saisnes ne\nwolde it not suffre, but assembled so thikke a-boute tho thre\nfelowes that thei hadde many grete strokes taken and yeven, and\nthei thre were noble and worthi, and slough of hem so many that\nher armes and her brestes were all blody, and also their horse\nheer, and so thei hem stered that noon was so hardy to a-byde of\nhem eny stroke. Whan the thre felowes saugh thei moste nede fosake Orienx,\nand saugh a worlde of peple that vpon hem com drivinge,\nthei ronne vpon Orienx and hym diffouled with theire horse feet\ntill he was all to-brosed; and whan he was all to brosed and hym\ndiffouled at her lust saf thei haue hym not slain, than thei rode\nafter her felowes that be that tyme myght be nygh Camelot, for\nneuer seth thei remeved were thei not enchased, but wente forth\ndelyuerly; and whan the thre felowes saugh her men were\nwithynne the town thei were gladde and mery, and than thei rode a\nsofte paas.  And the saisnes a-bode a-boute her lorde that was\ncaste down and so diffouled vnder horse feet, whereof he was so\nsorowfull whan he a-roos from disturdison that thei be so ascaped,\nthat nygh he was wode for wratthe and Ire, and swor yef he\nmyght hem gete in his bailly that he sholde do hem be flain all\nquyk and drawen a-sondre with horse.  \"Sir,\" seide his men,\n\"a full fell pawtener is he that twies this day thus hath yow smyten to grounde.\"  \"Ye,\" qoud Orienx, \"but yef I may haue\nbailly ouer his body, he shall so be deffouled that ther ne shall\nnothinge in the worlde hym warantise.\"  And thei hadde so\nriden that thei com before Camelot, where as thei a-bode stille,\nand asked oon of another where the other thre were be-come;\nbut ther was noon that ought cowde sey. Whan Agravain, and Gaheret, and Gaheries vndirstode how\nthat Gawein her brother and her cosin and the nevew\nof the Emperoure were loste, thei turned bakke and seide thei\nwolde not reste till thei hadde hem founden, and comaunded her\nfelowes not to remeve till thei saugh hem com a-gein; and than\nalle thre rode a-gein a walop as thei hadde come; but thei hadde\nbut litill while riden whan thei mette the karll that satte vpon\nthe steede that Gawein hadde hym yoven, the same that hadde\nbrought tidinges of Seigramor; and whan he mette these thre\nbretheren he asked whider thei wente; and thei seide thei sought\nGawein her brother, and her cosin Galaishin, and the nevew of the\nEmperour, for thei wiste not where thei were be-comen.  \"Ffull\neuell,\" seide he, \"haue ye yow demened, and well sheweth the worthi and noble where thei ben, and loo where thei come, but\nwhom it displese thei owe to come yow no thonke of her lyves, ffor\nye lefte hem foule as cowardes, and well it sheweth ther as thei\na-bode for to socour these other that now ben saf at garison; and\nthei haue doon many feire chiualries and yoven many grete strokes,\nthat thei ought to be comended and preised of all the worlde that\nther-of heren speke, and to holde yow for soche as ye be; and\nwele haue ye it shewed ther as ye lefte youre felowes at soche\nnede, and thei ne lefte yow neuer for deth ne for lif, and euery\nGentillman that ther-of hereth speke ought yow to blame be\nright and reson, and haue yow euer suspect in euery nede; and,\nwite it well, it shall turne yow to repress.\"  With that the cherll\ndeparted, that lenger with hem ne wolde talke.  And thei passeden\nforth all shamefest and mate, and sory of the wordes the karll\nhadde spoken; but thei nadde but litill wey riden whan thei\nmette the thre felowes, that were so araied that it semed by her\narmes that thei were come from felon place; and whan thei mette to-geder thei made grete ioye.  Than Gawein asked tidinges of\nher other felowes where thei were; and thei seide that thei hem\nlefte be-fore the yates of Camelot, where thei a-bide.  Than thei\nrode forth to-geder gladde and mery for her newe feliship that\nbe-come hem to helpe, and of that thei haue hem thus rescewed,\nand he and his companye hooll and sounde.  But er thei hade a\nwihile riden to-geder, thei mette the cherles horse sore affraied,\nthat com fleynge, and saugh the arson of the sadell all\nblody.  And when these felowes that he hadde reprovid saugh the horse,\nthat oon be-heilde the tother and be-gonne to laugh.  Of that toke\nhede Gawein and Galashin, and asked whi thei lowghen; and\nthei stynte for to telle; and thei hem coniured another tyme right\nharde for to telle the trouthe.  And Gaheries tolde hym alle the\nwordes that the cherll hadde hem seide.  And whan that thei it\nherde thei merveiled what it myght be; and than com Gawein to\nthe horse that fledde, and toke hym by the bridell, and saugh that\nall the arson was blody, and well that the karll hadde be slayn. Than he asked of Agravain and of the tother yef thei mette\neny of the saisnes seth thei departed fro Camelot, and\nthei seide how thei mette neyther man ne woman seth thei\ndeparted from their men, saf the cherll that satte vpon that\nhorse.

And whan Orienx saugh hem\nascaped that all this grete harme hadde hem don, he was full\nwroth and angry, but for all that he drough hym a-wey from the\nforeste; and the cristen rode all nyght that neuer wolde hem vn-arme till it was day.  And the kynge Clarion wente that nyght to Cambenyk with vij Ml and v C men that were hym be-lefte\nof the bataile; and whan thei sholde departe, the Duke Escam\ngraunted to sende hym his part of the pray that thei hadde wonne\nas soone as the saisnes were passed.  And thus thei departed\na-sounder, and kepte right well bothe two Citees, that no more\nharme ne hadde at that tyme.  And erly on the morowe the\nsaisnes were renged and a-raide, and than thei blewe hornes and\ntrumpes, and serched the contrey to wite where the cristin were\nbe-come and whiche wey, and than returned a-gein to Orienx, and\nseide thei were gon; and than was he sory and wroth, and made\nsownde his tymbres and tabours, and toke the wey toward\nCambenyk, and sente be-fore Napin, an admyrall, with xv Ml men, and\nhadde sente be-fore them thre thousande harlotis, for to sette fier\non the contrey a-boute, and for to waste the londe; and after the\nforewarde com the cariage and the prayes that was grete, and\nhem condited Adax with x Ml men, and after in the rerewarde com\nOrienx with xx Ml , and rode till thei com to Cambenyk, and than\ngonne thei to waste and distroie the contrey ther that were vilages;\nand these harlottis, that were forreyours, brente all a-boute.  And\nwhan the Duke Escam saw the distruxion he was full of sorowe,\nand comaunded his men a-noon to arme hem; and thei dide his\ncomaundement, and lept to horse lightly, two thousande, and com\namonge the harlotis that were forreyours, that so brente and\ndistroied, and ouertoke hem in valey; and whan thei saugh hem\ncome thei turned to flight, but thei were so supprisid, for theire\nhorse hadde rested and were fresch; and thei slough and maymed\nalle that thei myght ouer-gate, so that er the vangarde com of thre\nthousande there ascaped not xl; and whan these xl com to the\nvaungarde, thei cried, \"Fitz dei putein, what a-byde, ye\ntreitours!  se ye not how we be alle slain and deed, and ye myght alle oure\nenmyes haue slain and distroied, and saued youre frendes, yef ye\nhadde a little hasted; and shamed be the kynge Orienx but he\nhange yow heigher than other treitours vn-trewe, ffor ye hym\nshame and suffre his men to be diffoiled.\"  \"Pees, harlottis,\"\nquod Napin, \"shoche sholde ben youre payment; where be thei that thus haue yow don?\"  And than seide the ribaudes that\nthei were gon alle the glotouns to Cambenyk with-oute doynge\nmore.  And the saisnes than passed forth and no more harme\nther dide, and rode forth till thei com to the riche Citee of Clarence,\nthat hardogabran hadde be-seged hym-self the twentithe kynge;\nand whan Orienx com in to the hoste, hardogabran made of hym\ngrete ioye for the grete refreshynge that he brought of vitaile,\nfor he brought I-nough, and therfore was he moche preised.  And\non that othir side, as soone as the Duke Escam saugh the saisnes\nwere passed, he sente the half of the prise that thei hadde wonne\nto the kynge Clarion, of that thei had wonned vpon the launde\nvpon the saisnes that were so cruwell at the entre of the foreste\nof Bregnehan, for so was the name of the foreste, and the name\nof the rivere was Savarne.

And whan the two sones of kynge Vrien\nherde sey that the saisnes were passed, thei wende to haue no\ndowte, and armed hem wele and lepte on horse, and rode oute of\nthe castell of randoll, and were foure hundred wele armed at\ndevise, and rode till thei come to a brigge thre myle from the\ncastell of Bredigan, and whan thei were passed ouer, a-noon com\nageins hem Bilas, with xiiij Ml men of armes, that hadde the\nvaungarde of kynge Soriondes, that made kepe the passage that\nnoon sholde come oute of Bredigan, that hem myght don damage to the bakke of the hoste while thei forreyed.  And whan the\nchilderen saugh this thei were sore affraied, and thei gat the\nbrigge, and ther thei hem deffended strongly.  And on the tother\nside the kynge Ydiers faught at the ende of the cauchie so\nmerveilously, that neuer of so fewe peple was don do stronge bataile,\nand ther thei shewed soche prowesse, that the xx Ml torned to\ndisconfiture, and ther ne hadde noon ascaped ne hadde Soriondes\nturned bakke with his grete hoste, and ne hadde be that a-venture that he so turned vpon kynge Ydiers, the childeren of kynge\nVrien that were gon be-fore ne hadde neuer ascaped.  But resteth\nto speke of hem at this tyme, and telleth of that cherll that hadde\nchaunged his semblaunce in to the gyse of a squyer at Camelot,\nwhan that Seigramoor was rescued. Whan this squyer wiste that Gawein and his companye were\ngon to Bredigan, he was ther-of gladde and wele plesed,\nand also he knewe wele of the two Bretheren that were at the\ncastell of Randoll, and saugh wele how thei were in grete\nauenture of deth or to be taken, thanne he toke vpon hym the\nsemblaunce of a curroure trottinge on foote, and bar a letter seled in a\ncoffin, that was peynted with the armes of kynge Vrien, that he\nmade to be writen of Blase his maister, so as ye shull heren after;\nand whan it was I-wreten he departed from Blaase and com to\nBredigan, and he was tukked and on his heede a felt, and bar a\nlonge staff on his bakke, and he was sklender and lene and hadde\non lowe voyded shoon and blak hosyn, and his clothinge was\nblakke fustyan with bendes on the sleues, and girde with a\ngirdell harnesshed, and he was longe and broun and a blakke\nberde, and his heed bare with-oute coyfe, his hatte at his\nsholderes hanginge be-hynde by the laces; and he com to the maister\npaleys and yede vpon the greces, and whan he was a-bove he asked\nafter Gawein the sone of kynge loot, and a-noon oon hym shewde\nwhere he stode, and he com be-fore hym and set hym on hys\nknee; and Gawein hym dressed vp as he that was wele lerned\nand right wise; and he hym salude, \"From Ewein the more and\nfrom Ewein the a-voutres, the twey sones of the kynge Vryen\nhis cosyns, and to yow hath sente these letters.\" As soone as Gawein herde speke of tho childeren, he lepe on\nhis feet, and toke the letter and brake the seall and hit\nradde all to the ende as he that well hadde lerned his yowthe,\nand fonde writen how the letter seide,\"I Ewein, the sone of\nkynge Vrien, greteth well my cosin Gawein and myn other\ncosyns and frendes, and I lete yow wete that I am departed fro\nSorhan with-oute leve of my fader, bothe I and Ewein a-voutres\nmy brother; and we be-come oute of the castell of Randoll to\nthe brigge of Sorionde, where we haue founde x Ml saisnes that\nvs holde medle vpon the brigge, and we ne be but foure hundred;\nand on that other side the kynge Ydiers, that ne hath but xiiij Ml men in his companye a-gein xl Ml saisnes on the chauchie vnder\nRandoll, and as soone as the kynge Ydiers is departed thei will\ncome vpon vs and take alle but god vs helpe and ye vs socoure;\nand yef we be take or slain, the harme is owres and the shame\nyoures, and alle dayes of youre lif it shall be to yow reprof, and\nyef ye for cowardise leve vs to be socoured while ye haue power,\nand ther-fore remembre vs of pitee and of youre grete fraunchise.\" Whan Gawein hadde redde the letter he cried,\"Now as\narmes this tyme more hastely than eny other, and\nneuer be he preised that now is not hardy.\"  And whan the\nsquyers herde Gawein thei ronne to armes gladde and mery, ffull\nmoche thei desired to come in place where thei myght hem\nconquere loos and pris to encrese theire honours; and as soon as\nthei were armed thei lepte to horse and rode oute of Bredigan,\nand the yoman that hadde brought the letter was theire gyde;\nand thei were xx Ml men noble and hardy; and so thei rode a\ngrete spede, but firste thei departed her peple and devised her\nwardes in to vj.  The firste warde Gawein yaf vn-to Agravain\nhis brother with thre thousande men of armes wel a-raied, and\nthei rode a goode paas be-fore.  The seconde warde ledde Gaheret\nwith iij Ml men of armes that were vaillant and hardy.  The\nthridde warde hadde Gaheries, that were it cowde lede, and were\nalso iij Ml , and rode forth after the tother.  The fourthe bataile\nGawein yaf to Seigramor, the nevew of the Emperour of\nConstantinenoble, that right wele cowde hem helpe at nede, and were also iij Ml ; and thei rode forth after the tother cloos streite,\nand eche hadde a baner wher-to thei sholde relye whan thei were\nmedled with the saisnes.  The fifte bataile hadde Galashin hys\ncosin for to lede, and moche Gawein hym preide well for to do\nand wisely to rule for his men, and hadde with him also iij Ml ; and\nwhan he hadde hem departed and disseuered thei rode theire wey\na softe paas after Seigramor.  The vj te bataile, where-in was\nmoste peple, ledde Gawein hym-self, and bar a baner of sendall\nof ynde beende ther in a lyon of siluer, and thei kepte hem cloos\na-boute hym and were v Ml and moo; and whan he saught that alle\nthe tother were sette on her wey that oon after that other, than\nhe sette on a softe paas hool to-geder.  Ther sholde ye haue sein\nthe baners and fresh armes glyteringe in the wynde and fresh\nhauberkes bright shynynge above so many startelynge stedis that\nmade the fier fle from the Caliouns that alle that it be-heilde made\nher hertes to reioyse.  But now cesseth to speke of hem how\nthat thei ride to the brigge of dove, and returneth for the speke of\nthe kynge ydiers that fighteth with the saisnes. So sore faught the kynge ydiers a-gein xx Ml saisnes that he\nput hem alle to flight.  Ther was grete discounfiture and\ngrete trouble of men and horse that fellen deed to-hewen; and\nwhan Soriondes saugh hem fle he asked why that thei fledde, and\nthei hym tolde how that the kynge Ydiers hadde don hem grete\ndamage to the taile of the hoste that alle the xx Ml hadde\ndicounfited; and than returned Soriondes sory and wroth, and were\nwith hym moo than xx Ml , and rode till thei fonde the kynge Ydiers\nat the heed of the cauchie that yet was  fightinge a-gein the meyne\nof Maglaant, an amyrall saisne cruewell and felon, that grete\nharme dide to the cristin and was so douted that noon durste hym approche ne come vpon the cauchie, but launched to hym\nsperes and gysarmes grounden; and than com Soriondes with all\nhis peple that was so grete, and sette ouer the caunchie so rudely\nas horse myght renne.  Ther was thoo stif stour and mortall\nbataile, ffor at to grete a myschief were the men of the kynge\nYdiers, and moche thei loste at that encountre, but right dere\nthei it solden; but what a-vailed her well doinge, discounfited thei were and driven oute of the place, and it nedeth not to aske\nyef that the kynge Ydiers were sory and wroth, ffor ther he\ncursed the houre and the day that he was on I-crowned and that\nhe was at debate with kynge Arthur,\"ffor by the synne.\" quod he,\n\"that he haue don a-gein hym falleth to vs all these myschaunces,\nbut it is so ferforth that it is to late vs to repente.\" Thus repeired the kynge ydiers, but moche was his losse;\nand Soriondes repeired with all his pray that was so\ngrete to the caunchie, and passed ouer delyuerly, and rode be-nethe\nthe castell Randoll streight to the brigge of Doue, and put in\nthe vaungarde xv Ml men, and rode forth till that the fowarde\nsaugh the bataile at the brigge foot of the childeren that faught\na-gein x Ml that kepte the passage; and whan thei saugh this thei\nspedde hem faste to ride, for hem thought longe er thei were\ntaken, and whan the childeren saugh hem so come thei were sore\ndismayed; and than Ewein loked towarde Bredigan and saugh\nwhere that Agravian  com gripinge his baner, and he saugh wele\nthat thei were grete peple, and than he badde his felowes to be\nof goode chier, for he saugh come cristin knyghtes; and than\nseide his felowes,\"sir, how may ye hem se, and how shull we\ndo? for lo! here bith saisnes that cometh be-fore and be-hynde,\nand ne forwarde ne bakwarde may we not fle, but that we\nmoste perish, and on this side yef we take the feilde we myght\nhaue grete damage.\"  \"I shall telle yow,\" quod Ewein\navoutres, \"what we shull do; holde we vs to-geder cloos and make\nsemblaunte as we wolde with Ioyne, and than will we go down\nthis ryver at the spore, ffor yef that we a-bide hem that beth\nhere comynge thei shull vs haue taken alle er thei ben heder\nI-come.\" To this that Ewein a-voutres hath seide thei acorded well,\nand than thei closed hem rounde to-geder and hem\ndistrayned, but erst were the saisnes come hem right nygh\nwithynne the shote of an arblaste, and whan thei saugh the cristin\ncome thei sporered theire horse ouer the brigge at a brunt, and\nthei smyte thourgh the x Ml and ouer-threwe mo than CC at the\nfirste springe, and whan the saisnes wende hem to close they glenched down the river with spede of the spore that wey as\nthei saugh the cristin comynge.  Whan the fowarde of the\nkynge Soryoundes saugh hem that fledden, thei priked after hem\nmore than xv Ml , and pressed so thikke vpon the brigge and so\nstreite that many of hem fell in the water, and the x Ml that the\npassage kepten enchased the childeren till thei hem atteyned in\na medowe be-twene two rivers, and ther sholde haue ben hastely\nso grete losse-that neuer it myght haue ben restoreth, wher-of\nhadde be grete damage and grete doell to all the reame of logres;\nand than com Agrauain that well sein the chase be-gynne vpon\nthe childeren as soone as thei com down the brigge, and a-noon\nas Agravian com nygh the saisnes he lete his horse renne and\nhis felowes also and smote on hem so harde that all the foreste\nand the ryver resounded, and whan the speres were broken, thei\ndrough theire swerdes and be-gonne the medle crewell and felon,\nne neuer herde ye so fewe men that more delyuerly hem\ncontened, ffor so moche thei dide to theym that made the foure\nhundre for-sake place.  Agrauain and his companye drof hem\nbakke all a bowe draught, and that was grete socoure for the\nchilderen, for Ewein le graunde and Ewein A-voutres were bothe\nsmyte down of theire horses and fought on foote full sore, and\nalso a hundre of theire felowes vn-horsed and wounded and hurt\nright sore, and therefore the cristin hadde grete hevynesse, and\nhem drof bakke that thei myght not stynte on the grounde, and\nit was no merveile, for thei were but thre thousande and the\nsaisnes were x Ml , and also xv Ml that com hem to helpe that\npassed the brigge in grete haste, and as soone as thei were ouer\nthei sprad a-brode down the river and abode that oon the tother,\nand the x Ml foughten full vigerously that were full gladde of\ntheire peple that thei saugh repeire from Cornewayle, and the day\nbe-gan to chauffe, and the sonne was risen right high as a-boute\nthe houre of pryme, and the duste be-gan to rise right thikke\nthat a myle thens myght oon knowe where was the trouble. Whan Agrauain saugh that his peple myght not kepe her\ngrounde, he swor that he wolde not thens departe\nthough he sholde be deed tho in the place.  Than he smote the horse with the spores and daysshed in a-monge hem and\ncaught his swerde in bothe hondes and cried a Clarence with\nlowde voys, and be-gan to do soche maistries that his\ncompanye hadde merveile of his grete prowesse, ffor thei trowed not\nin hym so grete vertu as thei ther saugh, and the saisnes gretly\nhym douted for the merveiles that thei saugh hym don, but for\nall that hadde he litill profite; but as Gaheret com hym for to\nsocoure with thre thousande men of armes, and in his comynge\nhe made all the renges to fremyssh, for eche oon that com with\nhym bar oon to the grounde at theire metynge, and disparbled\nthe saisnes towarde the brige; and whan Ewein the more and\nEwein a-voutres saugh the saisnes drawe bak, thei seide thei hadde\nfounde strength of peple, and onn asked of a-nother.  \"Lorde god,\nwho may be these cristen, for fayn wolde we knowe?\"  Ther\nwas a yonge squyer that hyight Aces de Bemonde; he com to\nhem and seide, \"Sirs, be ye come in to this contrey to be-holde\nhere these turmentys and the feire strokes of knyghtis, for yef\nye wolde knowe what thei be, ye most a-vaunce yow forth and\ndo so that thei enquere who ye ben, for by theire prowesse is\nknowen the worthy where-so-euer thei ben, and ye ne do but\nmuse as fooles and lese youre tyme, and therfore lete vs helpe\nhem to discounfite these false saisnes, ffor what folke that these\nben cristin or other thei be worthi men, but moche me merveileth\nwhens come alle these saisnes, and soone it shall be shewed who\nshall do beste, ffor I yow a-vye to turney with oure enmyes that\nhaue don vs so grete damage, and to oure frendes and to oure\nauncestres, and yef we dye, at this nede more honourably ne may\nwe suffre the deth that for the love of Jeshu criste, and for his\nlawe to strengthe and encresen.\"  Whan the childeren herde Acon\nde bemonde thus speke, thei hadde grete shame and seiden that\nneuer wolde thei be holde for cowarde, and acon spronge forth\nand seide, \"Now be it seyn who doth beste.\"  Than thei hem\nrenged alle to-geder, and than thei sprongen in a-monge the\nsaisnes and be-gonne to smyte and throwe down on euery side, and diden so well that the worde and the renon com to Agrauain\nand to Gaheret that the childeren foughten be-nethe fer from\nhem.  Whan thei harde tho tidinges, thei wiste well it were the\nsones of kynge Vrien, and drowgh down that wey and made\nsoche martire of the saisnes that thei made tho x Ml to rebounde\nvpon the fowarde of kynge Sorioundes, that were mo than xv Ml ,\nand Agrauain and Gaheret haue so spedde that thei be come to\nthe childeren that sharply foughten, ffor Ewein le graunt and\nEwein a-voutres and Acon traueiled so merveillously that onn for\nthat other that gladde was Gaheret hem to be-holden, and so was\nhis companye, that a-gein diden so well that noon was founden\ncowarde ne ydell; and than com Agrauain to Acon and asked\nwhat were these childeren, and he ansuerde that thei were the\nsones of kynge vrien, \"that be come to take theire armes and to\nserve the kynge Arthur, her vncle, with alle thise meyne that\nye here sen.\"  \"Whiche be thei?\" seide Agrauain.  \"Sir,\" seide\nAcon; \"lo! hem ther in the armes half parted white and reade,\nbut what be ye that this enquere?\"  \"Certes,\" seide Agrauain,\n\"we be nevewes to the kynge Arthur and sones to kynge loot of\nOrkanye and of leoneys, and my name is cleped Agrauain and\nthis other Gaheret my brother, and oure lorde be worshipped and\npreised that we be now mette hool and sounde in his londe.\"\nThan thei com to the childeren and made to hem grete ioye, and\nthei asked what thei were; but litill while hadde thei be there\nwhan thei saugh come the vowarde of Saisnes with xv Ml men,\nand thei that fledded with hem in companye that yet were v Ml ,\nand drof the cristin a-bakke full fiercely.  Whan Agrauain and\nGueheret saugh hem come and the myschef so grete, thei seide\nto the childeren and to her companye, \"Cosin, holde yow a-boute\nvs in oure feliship;\" and thei ansuerde that thei wolde not hem\nlete for deth ne for lif; and than thei thronge to-geder and\nbe-gonne the bataile newe full stifly, but so longe myght thei not\nendure, for to many were the saisnes, that thei yaf bakke the\nspace of a bowe draught wheder thei wolde or noon, ne neuer thei sholde haue stynte till thei hadde come to Bredigan ne\nhadde be Gaheries that com with thre thousande men, but thei\nne wente not foule, for Agrauain and Gueheret and Ewein li\ngrans and Ewein a-voutres and Acon and Alechin, these yaf grete\nstrokes euer a-monge often that oon for the tother, and were\nhyndermeste in the route, and socoured her men wher thei saugh\nhem encombred.  Than com Gaheries with this warde of iij Ml goode men, and sette on hem full of Ire and malencolyus, and\nthrewe down and slowgh and kepte at stall a longe while, but in\nthe fyn he mote yeve grounde a litill, ffor than the saisnes\nbe-gonne to recover londe vpon hem.  But now a litill turneth the\ntale fro hem, and speketh of the kynge Sorioundes. While thei fought thus at the brigge ende, all the cariage\nand the pray that kynge Sorioundes brought com to the\nbrigge, and thei that hadde ther-of the kepynge seide thei sholde\nno ferther passe till thei saugh to what fyn the bateile sholde\ndrawe, ffor on this side that we be on nowe haue we no drede,\nand yef ther come vpon us gret forse of peple we may vs here\ndeffende better and more suerly, and more may we greve hem\nthan thei vs, ffor we shull be at the brigge heed and kepe hem\nso of, that nought shull thei haue of oures.  Than toke thei\ngrounde and hem logged; and the maistres that condited the\npray was Maglans and Pyngnores, and with hem xx Ml or mo;\nand than thei pight tentes and pavylouns, and Sorioundes rode\ntill he come to the brigge, and than he asked whi thei were so\nsoone herberowed, and thei seide thei were more sure on that\nside than on that othir side of the ryver, ffor we knowe not what\npeple that ther ben there.  \"Now,\" quod Sorioundes, \"loke\nthat ye be well a-raied to helpe oure peple yef it be nede;\" and\nthei seide that so thei wolde, but returneth now we agein to\nGaheries and to his companye that fighted be-twene the river of\nDione and Bredigan. Now seith the boke that the ix Ml and foure hundred cristin\nso foughten a-gein the saisnes that were well xx Ml or\nmoo, that moche loste that oon parte and that other, and the\nsaisnes more than the cristin, but longe ne myght endure the cristin for yet the childeren were tendre and grene, so that thei\nmoste nede remeve a-bronde in to the feilde, and in short tyme\nthei sholde haue hadde grete losse; but as Segramor com\nprikinge with thre thousand men armed, and hym thought right\nlonge er that he were assembled, and he smote vpon hem so\nfiercely that all the chase he made to cesse by fin force.  Than\nwas the stoure be-gonne harde and full crewell, ffull grete crakke\nand noyse ther was of brekynge of speres and stif strokes of\nswerdes vpon helmes and vpon hauberkes, and many horse and\nman leide on the grounde, and full well dide ther Seigramor and\nhis companye that many an hethen made his ende; but all that\nwell dede of Seigramor myght thei neuer stynte the saisness, ffor\nhis men were putt bakke that his well doynge myght not but\nlitill be sene; and than com Galaishin, with thre thousande men,\nand mette with hem so harde, that be-fore theire speres ne lefte\nnoon vp-right stondinge.  Than thei cried a Clarance with a\nlowde voyse, that is the worde and the signe of kynge Arthur,\nand the saisnes were sore greved and com a-gein hem and mette\nhem tho dispiteously that thei made hem alle to disparble a-gein\na-bakke.  Than a-roos the shoute and the noise vpon hem so\ngrete that the saisnes were driven bakke hastely with-oute eny\na-reste euen to the brigge of Dione.  Than ther was grete occision of\nthe saisnes, that of the xx Ml ther was slayn vij Ml er thei come to the\nbrigge, and yef theire socoure hadde not be so nygh ther hadde\nneuer ascaped noon of hem a-wey, but Maglans and Pyngnores\ncom for to socour theym with xx Ml saisnes as faste as thei myght\npasse the brigge, and many thei throwe to grounde in her\ncomynge.  Ther be-gan angwissous myschef and grete losse, for\nthe saisnes were xxx Ml and mo, and the cristin ne were but\nxiiij Ml what oon what other, and therfore thei were putte bakke\nthe space of a mark shote.  Ther suffred moche Galashin and\nSeigramor and Gaheries and Geheret and Agrauain and Ewein\nli grans and Ewein a-voutres and Aces of campercorentin and\nbrian of Arondell.  These diden merveillouse prowesse a-bove\nalle other that were in the hoste.  These ix suffred so moche,\nand so moche thei dide in armes, that alle hadde ben discounfited ne hadde be theire worthi dedes, but in the fin thei moste\nnede turne. Full grete was the stour and harde medle be-twene Dione\nand Bredigan ther as these xiiij Ml cristin be a-gein xxx Ml saisnes, and the myschef was grete for thei hadde ther grete\nlosse; and than com Gawein hem for to socour with v Ml men of\narmes, and than be-gan ther a grete stour and harde, ffor as soone\nas Gawein was come he be-gan to do so well that the saisnes\nrused and lefte place, ffor he slough man and horse whom that\nhe raught with his axe that he heilde with bothe hondes, and\nwhom he ther-with atteyned, hym myght warante neither Iren\nnor steill ne other armoure, ffor he alone sustened all the bateile,\nthat alle the saisnes fledde from his axe on euery side, and he hem\npursude so fiercely a-noon as noone was come that his strengthe\nbe-gan to double, tho was it no wisdome to a-bide hym eny stroke,\nfor he was so crewell for wrath and Ire, and he kepte hem so short\nthat on fin force he made hem to resorte to the entre of the brigge\nof dione, where thei were so thikke and so entacched ech amonge\nother, that mo than a thousand fill in to the river. Whan Sorioundes saugh the damage that these hym dide\nand the grete martire, he was so full of sorowe that ny\nhe yede wode for wrath, and fain wolde he haue come ouer the\nbrigge, yef he hadde myght for to haue foughten with hem to\nsocour his men, but thei were so thikke vpon the brigge and\ndown the river that noon myght come ouer; and thaugh the\nbrigge hadde ben all clene empty it hadde not be no light\nthinge for to haue passed, ffor Gawein and Galashin and\nSeigramor and Agrauain and Gaheries and Gueheret and Ewein li\ngrans and Ewein a-voutres were a-geins hem at the entre of the\nbrigge that fiercely hem deffended the entre that noon was so\nhardy that durste presse ouer, ffor thei slough so many and made\nsoche martire that ther was hilles of dede men and horse hem\nbeforn, that the toon myght not come to that other but launchant;\nand this assaut dured all the day till nyght that thei\nwithdrough; and on that other side Gawein and his companye\nwithdrough hem and wente a-gein to Bredigan, gladde and mery for the childeren that thei hadde so socoured at nede; and that nyght\nwas ther grete ioye and grete feste, and thei ete and dranke with\ngrete myrthe and solas, and after gon to bedde to reste, for thei\nwere full wery of trauayle, and thei rested till it was day, that\nthei wolde go a-gein to fight with the saisnes, a-gein whom thei\nwolde deffende the londe and the contrey for euer more.  But as\nthei were departed at euen from the brigge ther thei foughten,\nSorioundes sente to seche the grettest lordes of his hoste for to\ntake counseile what he sholde do, and as soone as he saugh his\nbarouns assembled he hem asked how he sholde don, for he hadde\nfounde the cristin full felon and crewell, and he was sore astoned\nfor the grete damage that thei hadde hym don of his peple; and\nthan a-roos vp Maglans vpon his feet, a grete Geaunt fell and\ncrewell, but he was right wise, and he spake right high that he\nmyght well ben herde. \"Kynge Sorioundes, yef thow will do my connseile, set forth\nthy Cariage now right and lete hem go be-fore oure\nchyuachie and neuer stinte till thei come to oure hoste, and\nPynogras shall hem condite with x Ml men be-fore in the firste\nfronte, and we shall come in the taile after with as moche peple\nas we can gete and assemble, and yef the cristen vs pursue thei\nmay be well receyved, and that the cariage be not letted to\niourney forth euer on her way, for that is the beste as me\nsemeth.\"  And than cried alle that saisnes that the kynge\nSorioundes sholde a-corde ther-to, as maglans hadde seide; and he\ncomaunded to trusse and charge the harnoys and sette forth the\nvaungarde be-fore firste ouer the brigge with x Ml saisnes or moo,\nand whan all the harneys was paste, than passed he ouer\nhymself with xxx Ml saisnes and rode after a softe paas all the nyght\nand all the nexte day with-oute eny more distrubinge till thei\ncome to Valdesbery ther as the sege was leide, and ther thei\nwere soone welcomed, ffor moche were thei desired for the vitaile\nthat thei brought, and thei brought I-nough wher-with the\nhoste was refresshed well in ese; but of hem ne speketh no\nmore at this tyme, but turneth to the childeren that ben in the\nCastell at Bredigan. Full gladde and ioyfull were these bretheren for the comynge\nof these childeren, the sones of kinge Vrien, and made\nhem great ioye and feste that nyght till thei were brought to\nbedde for to reste; and on the morowe erly Gawein sente a spie\nfor to se what the saisnes diden that thei hadde lefte at the\nbrigge of dione, and whan he com there he fonde that thei were\ndeparted and gon in the nyght, and than he returned and tolde\nto Agrauain how thei were alle gon, and he ther-fore was sory\nthat thei were so ascaped, but seth it myght be noon other thei\na-bode stille in the town, and soiourned to a-bide here tidinges of\nthe kynge Arthur or of other a-ventures. Hit fill on a day be-fore dyner that the childeren dide walke\nbe the ryver, and Gawein com to Ewein and seide,\n\"Feire cosin, how knewe ye that we were here assembled, and\nbe whos conseile sente ye me the lettere that ye sente me this\nother evenynge?\"  \"What lettere was that?.\"  quod Ewein, \"ffor\ntrewly I sente yow neuer noon in my lyve, ne I knewe of yow\nno tidinges, till god of his grace sente yow to vs whan we were\nin soche poynt, ffor elles hadde we be alle slain or taken and\ndistroied.\"  \"How,\" quod Gawein, \"feire cosin Ewein, sey ye\nin trowthe that ye sente me neuer letter that I sholde come yow\nto socoure.\" \"Sir,\" qoud Ewein, \"I sey yow soth ther-of\nwithoute faile.\" Whan that the bretheren herde that Ewein sente hem neuer\nletter ne message, thei merveiled moche fro whens he\nmyght come that hem hadde brought.  Than thei lete crie and\nenquere yef the man that hadde brought the lettere were yet in\nthe town; but thei cowde not here of hym no tydinge, and thei\ndesired sore to wite where he was be-come; thus thei a-bode in\nthe town viij dayes full, till that tidinges come to hem from\nArondell that tolde hem how the peple and the Gentilmen of the\ngarnyson were sore greved with the saisnes that euery day hem\nassailden, and how thei dide but loke after the howr that thei\nsholde alle be take.  Whan Gawein herde of the grete nede that\nthei hadde in the castell, he for-thought it sore.  Than he called\nhis felowes and seide it were goode to go thider to the Castell of Arondell for to rescewe theym, for thei haue grete mystere, and\nsholde we heire tidinges soneste of my fader the kynge loot, and\nthei seide thei wolde do hys volunte.  Than thei a-raide hem\nredy and toke her wey towarde Arondell, and were x Ml with-oute\nmoo of the beste horsed, ffor thei wolde not disgarnyssh the londe\nof peple, and so thei ride on euenynges and on morownynges,\nand by the moste vncowth weyes that thei knewe, till thei com\nhalf a myle from Arondell, and than thei herde grete bruyt and\ngrete noyse, ffor Arans the sone of Brangue was entred in to the\nlonde of leonoys, and hadde wasted moche of the londe all a-boute\nas he hadde gon and assayled the Castell of Arondell often tymes\nand hadde brente the borowgh; and it be-fill that ther com that\nwey a route of yonge squyres, and com oute of the londe of\nStrangore, and thei were a-bowte xxvj, and thei noon hede ne\nwere not war of the kynge Arans that hadde all day assailed the\nCastell of Arondell, but it was so well defended that no- thinge\nthei wonne, saf only thei hadde brent the bourgh with-oute,\nand than the saisnes hem with-droughen to resten, and as thei\nturned, thei mette the xxvj squyres that kay destranx and\nkehedyn dide lede. As soone as the saisnes saugh these squyres come, thei sette\non hem a showte and ronne vpon hem, ffor well thei\nknewe thei were cristen, and thei hem defended in the beste\nmaner that so small a peple myght.  Whan thei of the castell\nsaugh the bataile so be-gonne in the mydowes by the ryver, thei\nwiste well it were cristin and hem be-heilde a grete while, but\nthei weren so fewe that thei were not seen a-monge hem, and thei\nfoughten right harde and sore, but no while mygh thei endure,\nfor the saisnes were so many.  Than thei of the castell issed out\niiij C that were wight and hardy and put hem-self in a-uenture\nfor to socoure hem that were cristen, and thei smote in a-monge\nhem with so grete raundon that thei ben persed thourgh to the\nplace ther these squyres were that litill while elles sholde haue\nendured but that thei moste haue ben deed or taken; and whan\nthei were mette to-geder and a litill knowen than be-gan the\nmedle newe to enforce and harde bataile, ffor ther was many stroke yoven and receyved that wratthed sore the saisnes and\nwell it shewed for thei sowned theire hornes and tymbres and\ntrumpes, and that was token that thei wolde haue socoure; and\nthan the saisnes assembled on alle partees, that thei spredde all\nthe river of arson, and the meyne of the Castell de la roche were\ncome oute, and wente towarde the Citee of Clarance with grete\ncariage that was hem sente oute of Saxoyne, and thei dide it\ncondyte that it hadde brought thens, and thei were many and\nalle well armed, ffor as the booke seith thei were come ther-with\noute of Saxoyne mo than lx Ml with-oute the peple that was\nwith kynge Arans that were spradde a-brode thourgh the\ncontrey for to forrey, and thei hadde wasted and distroied that more\nthan two iourneyes ye sholde not haue founde nother house ne\ntown that a man myght herberowe in, hym ne his horse, ne fynde\nso moche vitaile for oon mannes repast.  But now let vs repeire to\nthe squyres vnder Arondell. At full grete distresse were thise xxvi squyres that hem\ndeffended a-gein xx Ml saisnes; but thei of the castell of\nArondell moche hem conforted and sustened, for in that company\nwere many worthy men that were grete lordes sones, ffor ther\nwas Ewein with the white honde, and Ewein de lionell, and\nEwein Estranis, and Grosenain de strangot, these were lefte for\nto a-bide the kynge Arthur for thei wolde no knyghtes be made\nbut of his honde, and alle were thei heigh menes sones, as kynges\nand Dukes, and also thei were nygh cosins to kynge loot of\nOrcanye and to kynge Brangore, and were alle come oute of her\ncontrey in pryve wise, ffor ther was noon of hem that com with\nmoo in his companye than xx, and thei a-bode ther as sowdiours\nfor wynnynge, for litill hadde thei brought oute of theire contrey,\nand thei haue so don that I-nough thei hadde geten of the saisnes. Whan these squyres com to the bataile the cry and the noyse\nencresed gretly; and whan these four hundred of the\ncastell come to these sex score, Ewein white honde, that was\nmore enquesitif, asked of whens thei were.  And kay destranx\nseide thei were squyers and sowdiours that wente to seche theire\narmes of the kynge Arthur, and how thei were nygh cosins to the two kynges of Strangore; and whan thei of the castell herde\nthat thei were squyers, thei asked yef thei wolde a-bide with hem,\nand thei wolde hem neuer faile, and that thei wolde a-bide alle\nto-geder till that the kynge Arthur were come, and than sholde\nthei gon in fere to take theire armes, for in the same wise were thei\ncome and for the same cause; and thei ansuerde that so hem\nliked wele. And while thei spake thus to-geder approched the cariage of\nthe roche, and weren in the firste fronte xx Ml of hem\nthat sholde it conditen, and xx Ml in the taile after; and as thei\ncom nygh Arondell thei saugh the x Ml saisnes that foughten with\nthise squyres vnder Arondell; and whan thei wiste it was the\nvowarde of kynge Arans thei slakede her brideles and environed\nthe squyres all a-boute; and thei hem peyned sore to repeire in\na-gein to the castell, but the saisnes were so many and so thikke\nthat thei myght not hem breke ne pershe; and so longe myght it not\nbe, but thei moste needes haue ben taken and the castell also, but\nthan com Gawein and his companye with x Ml men of armes; and\nas soone as saugh the bataile medled, thei lete theire horse\nrenne and com so harde that be-fore hem no-thinge myght\nwithstonde for her sharp trenchaunt speres.  Ther was stronge stour\nbe-gonne and many haubreke to-torne of double maile, and of\ndeed and wounded peple was all the feilde couered.  Ther loste\nthe saisnes many, wherfore thei were sory and angry, of the\ncomynge of Gawein hadde thei of the castell grete myster, ffor\nthei were at gret myschief, and in the comynge of Gawein and\nhis felowes thei were so vigerouse vpon the saisnes that thei\nresorted vpon the cariage that sewed after; and whan Gawein\nsaugh the squyres of Arondell he asked what thei were; and Ewein\nwhite hande seide thei were with kynge Arthur and were\ncome oute of the Castell for to rescue these squyres, and shewde\nhym theym that the saisnes hadde assailed; \"and what be ye that\nthus me demaunde and that thus come to this grete nede;\" and\nthan he hym named and seide he was come hem to helpe and alle his companye; and whan he hadde herde this he was so\ngladde that noon myght be more, and thanked god of the socoure\nthat was comen, and than thei cried \"Clarence!\" the worde of\nkynge Arthur, and smote in a-monge the saisnes and made soche\nmartire that all the feilde was strowed full of deed men and\nhorse.  Ther dide Gawein wonderes with his hondes, and\nGaheries and Agrauain and Galaishin and Seigramor and Gueheret\nand Ewein li grans and Ewein a-voutres the two sones of kynge\nVrien, and Ales and Aces.  These shewde there merveillouse\nprowesse; and on that other side also dide well and wonder\nmerveillous; Dodynell the Sauage, and Ewein white honde, and\nEwein lyonell, and Ewein Estrains, and Gosenayne de strangot,\nand Kay destranx and Kehedin the litill, these xvij were in the\nfore-fronte and made soche martire and soche slaughtere that noon\ndurste nygh hem ne abide a stroke, and alle theire other felowes\ndide also right well that alle the saisnes were fain to for-sake the\nfeilde, and be fin force to rebounde vpon the xx Ml that com after\nthe cariage.  And than com an olde man all vn-armed on a grete\nhorse to Gawein, that wolde haue pursued the saisnes, and he\nseide, \"Gawein, Gawein, and thou do after my rede returne\nagein and bringe with the alle thi felowes in to Arondell, ffor, lo,\nhere come saisnes a grete nombre, and we may not hem endure.\" Whan Gawein vndirstode the wordes of this wise man he\nhym be-heilde and saugh that he was right olde and so\ncroked that he merveiled that he myght holde hym on\nhorse-bakke, and saugh he hadde a grete beerde and a longe that\ncouered all his breste and was all white, and a chapelet of coton\nvpon his hede, and clothed in a robe of blakke, and for age heilde\nhym by the sadill bowe, and loked vpon Gawein and seide,\n\"Gawein, do as a wise man and leve me well, for alle thi felowes\nbe not of thi strengthe ne force, and as well owest thow to love\nher savetee and her lyves as thin owne, and thow sholdest synne\ndedly yef thei were loste thourgh thi foly, for heer-after may thei\ncome to grete goode, and of theym shall Arthur haue grete\nmyster thin oncle as soone as he is repeired oute of the reame of\nTamelide.\" Whan this olde man hadde seide these wordes, he turned the\nstreight wey towarde leoneys in Orcanye as moche as\nhis horse myght renne; and Gawein stynted and cleped his felowes\na-bowte hym, for the wise mannes counseile wolde he\nbeleve.  Than thei returned alle a softe paas towarde Arondell, and lefte\nthe chase, and entred in to the Castell and yede vpon the walles,\nand be-heilde the saisnes that hem renged and assembled, and\nrode towarde Arondell after the kynge Arans, that all the londe\nof kynge loot hadde wasted; and thei were so moche peple that\nnothinge myght hem with-stonde, and the kynge loot faught with\ntheym many tymes and loste moche of his peple, and sore was\nhe greved in the ende; so that he be-hoved to bringe his wif to the\nCastell of Glocedon for strengthe.  Whan the kynge saugh how\nthe saisnes wasted his londe and distroied, and hadde slain so\nmoche of his peple that he myght not but kepe hym in stronge\nplace, and than he was full of sorowe and of hevynesse, and\ncursed the hour and the day that he was at werre with kynge\nArthur, \"for by hym haue I loste alle my childeren,\" and on that\nother side his Citee was alle wasted, and he ne loked but after\nthe hour to be take with-ynne, ffor the walles were broke down\nin many places, and saugh also how the kynge Arans was loged\nall a-boute hym, and he hadde no peple in his companye that\nmyght eny while hym with-stonde yef the kynge Arans wolde\neny while soiourne, but he desired it not gretly but a-boode after\nhis men that the contrey wasted and distroied all environ. Whan the kynge loot saugh hym-self in soche auenture, he\ntoke counseile what was beste to do, and his counseile\nin the ende was this, that at the firste cokke crowinge he sholde\nlepe to his horse, he and his wif, and his litill sone that was but\ntwo yere of age, and lede hem to Glocedon, and sholde haue with\nhym v hundre men well armed, and that other part sholde a-bide\nstille that yet were vj Ml of noble man and hardy, and thei hym\npromyseden that thei sholde kepe well the Citee while there life\nmyght endure.  At mydnyght the kynge and his companye toke\ntheire horse and his litill sone mordered that the kynge Arthur\nhadde be-geten in soche manere as ye haue herde devised, and a squyer hym bar in a litill cradell, hym before, vpon his horse\nnekke, and rode oute by a fause posterne of the Citee toward\nthe gardins and entred in to a lane, and rode all nyght and all\ndaye till noone that neuere hadde distrubinge; but than was the\nkynge loot sore aflayed, ffor they mette Teucus with thre\nthousand saisnes that repaired from Arondell that condited the pray\nto the kynge Arans, and as soon as thei knewe the kynge loot,\nthei ronne vpon hym with grete hete, and ther a while was\nstronge stour and full nobly dide the kynge loot and the vC that\nwere in his companye; but of well doynge was litill myster, for\nsoone were thei discounfited and chased oute of the feilde, and\nhis wif also I-take.  Than the squyer fledde towarde Arondell as\nfaste as the horse myght hym bere.  But now cesseth a litill of\nkynge loot and returne to Gawein. Full gladde and mery were Gawein and his felowes at Arondell\nthat nyght that whan thei were knowen to-geder of the\nsquyers that thei hadde rescuwed; and as thei were in this ioye\nand in this feeste, com a knyght right well armed vpon a grete\nsteede all for swette, and his shilde all to-daisht and hewen with\nstrokes that he hadde receyued of swerdes a-bove and be-nethe,\nand his couerynge cote alle to-rente, and his hauberke torn and\nbroken in many places, and he com be-fore Arondell a grete\nwalop gripynge his launce, and whan he com be-fore the castell\nyate he stynte, and saugh the squyres a-bove on the walles that\ngrete ioye made oon to a-nother, and a-noon he gan to crie, yef\nther-ynne were eny squyer that were so hardy that durste hym\nsnewen thider as he wolde go, be soche a condicion that he sholde\nhaue no drede of no man but of his owne corse.  Whan Gawein\nit vnderstode, he asked what wey he wolde go.  Quod the knygth,\n\"What art thow that spekest to me?\"  \"My name,\" quod he,\n\"is Gawein the sone of kynge loot.\"  \"Than shall I telle yow,\"\nquod he, \"fort the a-venture a-perteneth to yow more than to eny\nother, and certes seide the knyght in to the entre of this foreste\nis the prowesse that I of speke.  But ye haue not the prowesse\nne the hardynesse that ye dar me sue, and yet is it oon of the\nmoste honourable a-uenture in this worlde, and that ye sholde moste be preised yef ye myght it a-cheve, but ye haue nother the\nherte ne the hardyness that ye durste thider come, and wite it\nwell but ye will come, I will go sooll be my-self.\" Whan Gawein vnderstode hym that so cleped hym cowarde\nhe was shamefaste, and seide that though he sholde\ndye he wolde holde hym companye, and he be-gan for to go that\nfull well knewe his corage, and Gawein cleped hym a-gein and\ncried, \"Sir knyght, lo! me here all redy to go with yow.  But\nthat ye shull me ensure that for noon euell ye make me it for to\ndo, and that ye shull me helpe at youre power a-gein alle tho\nthat will me mys-do.\"  Whan he herde these wordes he a-bode\nand be-gan to smyle as it were in scorne, and seide as for that\nsholde he not lette, but that he wolde make hym the assuraunce,\nand Gawein asked his armes and armed hym wightly a-noon, and\nhe a-boode that gretly hym hasted.  And the felowes of Gawein\ncom to hym and seide, \"Sir, what thinke ye to do?  Ne goth not\nwith-outen vs, for we wote neuer whether it be for goode or for\neuell.\"  And Gawein seide that he wolde well that thei wente\nwith hym yef the knyght wolde assente.  \"And we shull hym\naske,\" seide Galashin.  Than ran Seigramor to the knyght and\nasked, \"Sir knyght, and it plese yow ther ben somme here-ynne\nthat fayn wolde go with yow in companye, and theire feliship\nshall yow nought empeire, and therfore thei yow preyen by me\nthat ye will hem graunte to holde with yow companye.\"  And\nthe knyght hem ansuerde and seide he wolde it well, and well it\nhym plesed that alle wente that go wolde, ffor the auenture is\nsoche that noon shall faile to fynde his auenture that ther\ncometh; and than Seigramor was gladde, and a-noon thei armed\nhem ther-ynne with grete spede till thei were vij Ml that mo thei\nwolde not lede, but tho were of the beste, and of theym that were\nbeste horsed, and whan thei com oute of the castell, Gawein toke\nthe assuraunce of the knyght that for noon euell he com not hym\nfor to seche. Than thei wente ridinge all the day and all the nyght till it\ncom to the dawenynge, and than thei herde at the ende\nof a launde a grete crye and a grete noyse of peple, and as hem semed ther were many, and than thei mette a squyer that fledde\nvpon a grete horse that a bar chielde be-fore hym in a cradell,\nand when Gawein hym mette, he asked hym with whom he was\nand whi he fledde so faste; and he hem be-heilde and saugh that\nthei were cristin, and seide, \"I am with the kynge loot that the\nsaisnes hau discounfited at the end of this launde towarde that\nwode, ffor he was goynge toward Glocedon and ledde with hym\nhis wif, and now thei haue hir taken and chased hym oute of\nthe feilde, and I am thus fleynge as ye seen with this childe that\nis hers, ffor neuer shall I it lete till I haue sette it in soche place that it shall not haue drede of the saisnes that in to this\ncontrey ben entred, and for the love of god ne go ye no ferther\nfeire lordes, for ye shull fynde ther so grete plente of saisnes that\nye ne shull may hem endure.\"  \"Certeis,\" seide Gawein, \"but\nI shall telle the what thow shalt do; thow shalt go reste the\nhere in this wode till thow se what shall falle of this bataile, and\nafter, yef I may ascape, I will the bringe ther as thow ne childe\nshull haue no drede of noon euell that no man shall yow do,\"\nand praide hym so that he hym graunted. With that thei departed that oon from that other, and the\nknyght wente forth that moche dide Gawein for to\nhaste, and badde hym sue faste with-oute lettinge, and ther-with\nhe rode faste be-fore; and whan Gawein saugh he wente he\nspored his horse after and so dide his felowes also, and rode faste\ntill thei were paste the foreste, and saugh the chase that euen tho\nwas be-gonne after the kynge loot, that fledde to Glocedon with\nthe peple that was hym be-lefte of the bataile; and on that\nother side Gawein be-heilde in the myddill of the medowe, and\nsaugh a lady of grete bowte ne hadde be the doell and the sorowe\nthat she made and the myschief that she was ynne, and she was\nall discheuelle in her heer, and Taurus hir heilde be the tresses\nand drough hir after his horse, and hir robe that she was in clad\nwas so grete that for combraunce she myght not a-rise, and she braied\nand cride with an high voyse, \"Seint Marie, blissed lady and moder\nof god! helpe me and socour.\"  And whan she cried and cleped\noure lady seint marie, Taurus smote hir with his honde armed right sore that she fill down to the erthe euen as she hadde be\ndeed, and whan he hadde sette hire vpon his horse she fill a-gein\ndown to the erthe as a woman that was hurte, and cried and\nbraide right lowde, and seide that she wolde fayne be deed;\nand he a-gein sette hir vpon horse, and she fill down a-gein\nto grounde, and seide as longe as she myght lyve sholde he neuer\nlede thens for no power that he hadde; and whan he saugh that\nhe myght not hir maistrie, he hente hir be the tresses and drough\nhir towarde the horse trailinge, and somte hir so that she was all\ncouered in blode what from mouthe and nose; and so he hath hir\ntrayned and drawen, that the lady myght no lenger crye ne brayen,\nshe was so hoorse and so brethles that on hire feet myght she not\nstonde ne sustene. And whan the knyght saugh the lady so euell be sein he\nseide to Gawein, \"Now, Gawein, knowest thow not that\nlady yonder, and yef euer ye hir loved dayes of youre lyf thinke\nhir to rescowen and to a-vengen.\"  And as soone as Gawein\nsaugh he knewe hire well; than he was so full of angwissh that\nner he yede oute of his witte, ne he wende neuer to haue sein the\nhour to haue come ther-to.  Than he smote the horse with\nsopores all that he myght, and hielde a grete shorte spere, the\nheed right sharp and trenchaunt; and mydday was somdell\npassed and the sonne right high, and Gawein cried to Taurus,\n\"Leff the lady, traitour fitz aputain! in euell tyme hast thow\nher so delerous mette, for neuer in thi liff didest thow foly that\nthow shalt bye so dere.\"  And whan Taurus saugh hym come\nthat so gretly to hym cried and manaced, he lete the lady falle\nand righted his armes and toke a grete spere and a rude and lete\nrenne his horse a-gein hym; and Gawein and he smote to-geder\nas harde as theire armes myght dure, and Taurus brake his spere,\nand Gawein smote hym so rudely thourgh shelde and hauberke\nthat the spere heede shewde thourgh his chyne an arme lengthe,\nand he blussht so harde to grounde that his nekke brake a-sonder;\nand Gaheret and Gahereis and Agrauain a-light down, and oon\nsmote of his heed and a-nother thriste hym thourgh with his\nswerde, and the thirde smote of bothe his armes, for it was not I-nough to hem that Gawein hadde don, but made of hym smale\npeces; and these other smote in a-monge the saisnes and made of\nhem soche martirdom and soche occision that thei slough mo than\nx Ml er thei leften; and Gawein slough so many that he was all\nwete in blode and brayn that his armes dropped down as he hadde\nbe wete in a flode.  And whan that the saisnes saugh the grete\noccision that vpon turned, thei fledden alle that myght thourgh\nwode and thourgh playn; and Gawein repeired thider as he\nsaugh hys moder ly, and a-light on foote, and toke hir in his\narmes and fonde hir euen as deed; and he wepte sore that the\nteeris ronne down from his iyen as thikke as water hadde be\nthrowen in his visage, and cried and wrange his handes and\nmade soche doell and sorowe that alle his felowes were ther-with\na-noyed and hadden ther-of grete pite that ther nas noon but\nwepte water with his iyen; and whan the bretheren of Gawein\ncom thider ther be-gan the doell and sorowe so grete that noon\nerthly man myght devise noon gretter. Whan the lady vndirstode the brayes and the cries that the\nbretheren made a-boute hir, she opened hir iyen and\nsaugh hir sone Gawein, that hir heilde in his armes, and knewe\nhym wele a-noon, and lifte vp hir handes ioynynge towarde\nheuene, and thanked oure lorde of that socoure that he hadde hir\nsente.  Than she spake as she myght and seide, \"Feire sone\nGawein, be stille and wepe no more, for I haue not the harme\nthat I sholde dye fore, but hurte I am right sore;\" and than she\nasked hym where his bretheren were, and a-noon thei com before\nhir makynge grete doell, and whan she hem saugh she thanked\noure lorde, and in a while aftere a-noon she seide, \"Haa las! my\nsone mordred haue I loste, and my lorde youre fader that this day\nhath suffred grete peyne me for to rescewen and socour, ffor whan\nhe hadde alle loste his men I saugh hym fight longe a-gein v C men\nand a-bode while oon myght haue gon half a myle of grounde\nvpon his feet, and therfore I haue grete drede that he be wounded\nto the deth, ffor I saugh hem launche at hym knyves and\ngavelokkes and dartes soche foison as it hadde reyned from heuene;\nne neuer wolde he voide the place ne me forsake till I hym coniured for that he loved beste in the worlde that he wolde\ngon his wey, and than he dide so sorowfull that no man myght\nmore.\"  \"Dame,\" quod Gawein, \"of Mordred my brother I can\ntelle yow tidinges, ffor the squyer that it bar hath hym kept\nwisely and vs a-bydeth in this foreste, but of the kynge my\nfader I can not sey.\" Whan the lady it vndirstode that it hevied her herte and\nswowned in Gaweins armes, and he her kiste and wepte\nright sore, and whan she com a-gein from swownynge she yaf a\nsore sigh, and with that the coloure com a-gein in to her visage,\nand than she asked Gawein watir to waisshe hir face, that was\nall soilede with blode, and oon it brought in an hatte of stiele,\nand than she wossh hir visage as softely as she myght; and than\nthei ordeyned hir a litier vpon two palfrayes, and leide ther-ynne\nfresch gras and erbes plente and clothes, and than leide her\ntherynne softely, and than gadered the prayers that thei hadde wonne of\nthe saisnes and wente forth to Arondell a goode spede, and thei hadde\nbut litill while riden whan the squyer com be-fore hem with the\nchilde; and than was Gawein gladde, and rode forth with the\nchilde till thei com to Arondell, where-as thei soiourned viij\ndayes full till the lady was hool, and than thei departed from\nthens and wente to logres, the chief Citee of the kynge Arthur,\nalle the company to-geder; but two hundre squyers thei lefte at\nArondell to kepe the Castell, and ledde with hem the lady and hir\nlitill sone.  And the foure bretheren swore that neuer sholde the\nkynge loot her fader haue a-gein theire moder till that he hadde\nacorded with kynge Arthur theire vncle.  Of this thinge that\nthei dide was the lady gladde; and so thei spedde theire iourneyes\ntill thei com to lorges, where thei were receyved with grete\nhonoure and reverence.  And Doo of Cardoell made to hem grete\nioye and feeste, and so dide alle the Citee; but whan thei\nparceyved the lady thei made moche more ioye, and hir dide as grete\nworship as myght be don to eny lady of the worlde; and euery\nman was gladde of the a-venture that god hadde hem sente.  And\nthan made Gawein to enquere and serche yef eny man knewe the\nknyght that hadde hem ledde to socour his moder, but noon cowde telle of hym no tidinge.  And so the tidinges ronne vp\nand down that doo of Cardoell it wiste, that was a noble knyght\nand a sure and a wise, and thought well in his herte who this\nknyght myght be; and than he com to Gawein and seide, \"Sir,\nknewe ye neuer that man that brought yow firste tydinges of\nSeigramor and also of Ewein youre cosin?\"  \"I neuer hym\nknewe ne saugh be-fore,\" quod Gawein.  \"Nor hym,\" quod Doo,\n\"that taught yow where was youre moder, ne knewe ye no\nhym?\"  \"No, truly,\" quod Gawein.  Than thought doo a-noon what he\nwas and gan to smylen; and Gawein merveiled moche why he\ndide aske, and than he hym coniured be the feith that he ought\nto the kynge Arthur his lorde, and praied hym dierly also to telle\nhym whi he asked hym that demaunde and wherfore he\nlowgh.  And than he seide, \"Gawein, Gawein, so moche ye haue me\nconiured that I shall telle yow whi; but be well ware that ye\nlete no man knowe of no-thinge that I sey vn-to yow.\"  And\nGawein seide, \"Nay, for hym were lever to haue his tonge\ndrawen oute.\"  \"Knowe it verily,\" quod Doo, \"that he that alle\nthese tidinges hath brought it is Merlin, that is the beste devynour\nthat is in all the worlde or euer was.\"  \"How sir,\" quod Gawein,\n\"speke ye of that Merlin that was so well be-loved of\nVterpendragon, that was be-geten of the devell vpon a woman?\"  \"Of\nthat same,\" seide Doo, \"speke I with-oute faile.\"  \"A god\nmercy,\" seide Gawein, \"how myght this be or bifalle that I haue\nseyn hym in so many maner formes, for I haue seyn hym in thre\nsemblaunces.\"  \"Wite it well,\" quod Doo, \"how that euer ye haue\nhym seyn it is he verily, ffor he is so full of stronge art that he\nhym chaungeth in to as many semblaunces as he will.\"  Than\nGawein hym blissed for the merveile that he ther-of hadde, and\nseide that he wolde with hym be a-queynteth yef it hym plesed,\nffor I wote well now that he vs loveth, whan that he entermeteth\nhym of oure deedes.  \"Knowe it well,\" quod Doo, \"yef it plese\nhym ye shall it wite, ffor we may nothinge do ne sey but he it\nwite.\"  Thus a-bode the squyres at logres gladde and myrry of\nthat oure lorde hadde hem assembled to-geder, and thei kepte the\ncontrey aboute that the saisnes euer more loste than wonne.  But now leveth the tale of hem and speketh of the knyght that ledde\nGawein for to socour his moder.", "18": "CHAPTER XIX. MERLIN'S MEETING WITH LEONCE. HIS ADVENTURES WITH NIMIAME. Now seith the storye, that whan Gawein and his felowes were\nmedled with the meyne of Taurus, and this knyght saugh\nthat Gawein hadde his moder rescowed he departed a-wey so\nsodeynly that no man wiste where that he be com, and wente\nin to Northumbirlonde to Blaase his maister and tolde hym alle\nthese aventures that hadde be don in the reame of logres; and\nBlase of hym was ioyfull and gladde, and wrote these thinges\nthat he hym tolde, and by hys booke haue we yet the knowynge\nof the seide a-uentures.  And whan he hadde be ther as longe as\nhym liked, he seide he wolde go in to the reame of Benoyk, ffor\nsoone elles myght the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors haue grete\ndamage while thei ben with Arthur in Tamelide, and that were\ndedly synne, for thei ben full noble men and trewe, ffor the\nkynge Claudas de la desert hath don homage to the kynge of\nGaule, and he hath promysed hym to helpe and to maynteyne,\nand on that other side this Claudas hath so purchased that he\nhath be at Rome, and he and the kynge of Gaule haue take theire\nlondes to the Emperoure be soche covenaunt that the Emperour\nIulius shall sende hym socour and wolde sese the two remes of\nBenoyk and Gannes; and thei assemble and somowne on alle\npartees, and now be meved the romaynes with an huge peple,\nand theire lorde and gouernoure is Pounce, Antony, tweyne of the\ncounseillours of Rome, that be two grete lordes and mighty, and\nalso on that other part cometh for love of hem, ffrolle a Duke of\nAlmayne that is right a grete lorde of londe and of richesse and\nof ffrendes, and is cosin germain to Antony and to Pounce, and\nech of these bringeth xx Ml at his baner, and thise of the reame\nof Benoyk ne knowen it nought and so sholde thei alle be\ndistroide er thei token hede or were ther-of war. Whan Blase this vndirstode he be-gan to wepe, and seide to\nMerlin, \"Ffor the love of god haue pitee of cristin\npeple that thei be not distroied;\" and he seide while that he\nmyght lyve he wolde hem helpe with all his counseile.  \"And\nyet,\" quod Merlin, \"it is the londe that I ought moste for to\nhate, ffor in that londe is the wolf that the lupart shall bynde\nwith cercles that shall nother be of Iren ne steile ne tree ne\ngolde ne siluer ne lede ne nothinge of the erthe ne of the water\nne herbe, and shall be so streite bounde that he shall not\nmeve.\"  \"A god mercy,\" quod Blase, \"Merlin, what is that ye\nsey?  is not the leopart more of strength than is the wolf, and more he\nis to doute?\"  \"Yesse, truly,\" quod Merlin.  \"How may the\nwolf than haue power ouer the leopart?\"  quod Blase.  \"Ye\nshull no more knowe,\" quod Merlin; \"but \u00feus moche I will\ntelle yow, that this prophesie shall falle vpon me, and I wote\nwell I may me not kepe ther-fro.\"  And Blase hym sayned for\nthe merveile, and than he be-gan to aske, and seide, \"Merlin,\nnow telle me this, yef ye go now in to Benoyk, what shall\nfalle of this londe that the saisnes thus go distroyinge?\"  \"Of\nthis ne care yow nought,\" quod Merlin, \"ffor Arthur shall\nneuer Iustise his barouns till that thei be well scowred, and\nknowe it well thei shall be driven oute in short tyme, and on\nthat othir side ne were for the merveillouse leopart that shall\ncome oute of the reame of Benoyk that shall be so grete and\nso fiers that alle other beestes shall surmounte bothe of this\ncontrey and of the bloy bretaigne, and of hym shall come the\ngrete lyon to whom alle beestes shull enclyne and for whos\nlook the heuene shall open.

This mayden of\nwhom I speke was the doughter of a vauasor of right high lynage,\nand his name was cleped Dionas, and many tymes diane com to\nspeke with hym, that was the goddesse, and was with hym many\ndayes, for he was hir godsone; and whan she departed she yaf\nhym a yefte that plesed hym wele.  \"Dionas,\" quod diane, \"I\ngraunte the, and so doth the god of the see and of the sterres\nshull ordeyne, that the firste childe that thow shalt haue female\nshall be so moche coveyted of the wisest man that euer was\nerthly or shall be after my deth, whiche in the tyme of kynge\nVortiger of the bloy mountayne shall be-gynne for to regne, that\nhe shall hir teche the moste parte of his witte and connynge by\nforce of nygremauncye in soche manere, that he shall be so desirouse\nafter the tyme that he hath hir seyn that he shall haue no power\nto do no-thinge a-gein hir volunte, and alle thinges that she\nenquereth he shall hir teche.\"  Thus yaf diane to Dionas hir yefte,\nand whan Dionas was grete he was right a feire knyght and a\ngoode, of high prowesse of body, and he was moche and longe,\nand longe tyme serued a Duke of Burgoyne, that to hym yaf his\nnyece to ben his wif, that was right a feire maiden and a wise. This Dionas loved moche the deduyt of the wode and the\nriver while that he was yonge, and the Duke of Burgoyne\nhadde a parte in the foreste of brioke, so that was his the haluendell all quyte, and that other half was the kynge Ban.  Whan\nthe Duke hadde maried his nyece he yaf to Dionas his part of\nthis foreste and londe that he hadde a-boute grete plente, and\nwhan Dionas wente it for to se it plesed hym wele, and he lete\nmake a maner to repeire to, that was right feire and riche by the\nvyuier, and whan it was made he com thider to be ther for the\ndeduyt of the wode and the river that was nygh, and ther a-boode\nDionas longe tyme, and repeired ofte to the court of kynge Ban,\nhym serued with ix knyghtes, and in his seruise he yede at many\na grete nede a-gein the kynge Claudas, to whom he dide many a\ngrete damage, till that the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors hadden hym in grete love, ffor thei knewe hym so noble a knyght\nand so trewe, and the kynge Ban to hym graunted his parte of\nthis foreste in heritage to hym and to his heyres, and londe and\nrentys grete foyson; and the kynge Boors yaf hym also a town\nand men and londe, for the grete trouthe that he saugh in hym,\nand he was so graciouse, that alle tho that a-boute hym repeyred\nloved hym a-bove all thinge.  Thus dwelled Dionas in that londe\nlonge tyme, till that he gat vpon his wif a doughter of excellent\nbewte, and hir name was cleped Nimiane, and it is a name of\nebrewe, that seith in frensch, ment neu ferai, that is to sey in\nenglish, I shall not lye, and this turned vpon Merlin, as ye shall\nhere her-after.  This mayden wax till she was xij yere of age\nwhan Merlin com to speke with leonces of Paerne, and Merlin\nspedde hym so that he com to the foreste of Brioke, and than he\ntoke a semblaunce of a feire yonge squyre, and drowgh hym down\nto a welle, where-of the springes were feire and the water clere,\nand the grauell so feire that it semed of fyn siluer.  To this\nfountayn ofte tyme com nimiane for to disporte, and the same\nday that Merlin com thider was she come; and whan Merlin hir\nsaugh he be-hilde hir moche, and a-vised hir well er he spake\neny worde, and thought that a moche fole were he, yef he slepte\nso in his synne to lese his witte and his connynge for to haue the\ndeduyt of a mayden, and hym-self shamed, and god to lese and displese.  And whan he hadde longe thought, he hir salued, and\nshe ansuerde wisely and seide, \"That lorde that alle thoughtes\nknoweth sende hym soche volunte and soche corage that hym be\nto profite, and hym not greve ne noon other, and the same welthe\nand the same honour hym sende as he wolde to other.\"  And\nwhen Merlin herde the maide thus speke, he sett hym down vpon\nthe brinke of the welle and asked hir what she was; and she\nseide she was of this contrey, the daughter of a vauasour, a\ngrete Gentilman, that was at a manoir ther-ynne, \"and what be\nye, feire swete frende?\" quod she.  \"Dameselle,\" quod Merlin,\n\"I am a squyer traueillinge that go for to seche my maister, that\nwas wonte me for to teche, and moche he is for to preise.\"  \"And\nwhat maister is that?\" seide the maiden.  \"Certes,\" quod he,\n\"he taught me so moche, that I cowde here reyse a Castell, and\nI cowde make with-oute peple grete plente that it sholde assaile,\nand with-ynne also peple that it sholde defende, and yet I sholde\ndo mo maistries, ffor I cowde go vpon this water and not wete\nmy feet, and also I cowde make a river where as neuer hadde\nbe water.\" \"Certes,\" seide the maiden, \"these be queynte craftes, and\nfayn wolde I that I cowde do soche disportes.\"  \"Certes,\"\nseide the squyer, \"yet can I mo delitable pleyes, for to reioise\neuery high astate more than these ben, ffor noon can devise\nnothinge but that I shall it do, and make it to endure as longe as I\nwill.\"  \"Certes,\" seide the maiden, \"yef it were to yow no gref,\nI wolde se somme pleyes by couenaunt that I sholde euer be youre\nlove.\"  \"Certes,\" seide Merlin, \"ye seme to me so plesaunt and\ndeboneir, that for youre love I shall shewe yow a party of my\npleyes, by couenaunt that youre love shall be myn, for other\nthinge will I not aske.\"  And she hym graunted that noon euell\nne thought, and Merlin turned hym a-part and made a cerne with\na yerde in myddell of the launde, and than returned to the\nmaiden, and satte a-gein down by the fountayn, and a-noon the\nmayden be-heilde and saugh come oute of the foreste of briogne\nladyes and knyghtes and maydons and squyres, eche holdinge\nother by the hondes, and com singinge and made the grettest ioye that euer was seyn in eny londe, and be-fore the maiden com\nIogelours and tymbres and tabours, and com be-fore the cerne that\nMerlin hadde made, and whan thei were with-ynne, thei be-gonne\nthe caroles and the daunces so grete and so merveilouse, that oon\nmyght not sey the fourthe parte of the ioye that ther was made,\nand for that the launde was so grete, Merlin lete rere a vergier,\nwhere-ynne was all maner of fruyt and alle maner of flowres, that\nyaf so grete swetnesse of flavour, that merveile it were for to\ntelle; and the maiden that all this hadde seyn was a-baisshed of\nthe merveile that she saugh, and was so at ese that sche ne\na-tended to no-thinge but to be-holde and entende what songe thei\nseiden, saf that thei seiden in refreite of hir songe, \"Vraiement\ncomencent amours en ioye, et fynissent en dolours.\"  In this\nmaner dured the ioye and feste from mydday to euenesonge, that\noon myght here the noyse from fer, ffor it was right high and\nclere, and plesaunt to heren, and it semed to be of moche peple,\nand oute of the Castell com Dionas and man and wif grete plente,\nand be-heilde and saugh the feire orcharde and the daunces and\nthe caroles so feire and so grete, that neuer hadde thei seyn soche\nin theire lives; and thei merveilled gretly of the orcharde that\nthei saugh ther so feire ther noon was be-fore, and on that other\nside thei merveiled whens alle these ladyes and the knyghtes\nwere come so wele a-pareiled of robes and Iuewelles.  And whan\nthe caroles hadde longe dured, the ladyes and the maydenys satte\ndown vpon the grene herbes and fressh floures, and the squyres\nset vp a quyntayne in myddes of the medowes, and wente to\nbourde a partye of the yonge knyghtes, and on that other parte\nbourded the yonge squyres with sheldes oon a-gein a-nother that\nneuer ne lefte till euesonge tyme.  And than com Merlin to the\nmayden and toke hir be the hande and seide, \"Damesell, how\nseme ye?\"  \"Ffeire swete frende,\" seide the mayden, \"ye haue\ndon so moche that I am all yours.\"  \"Damesell,\" quod he, \"now\nholde my couenaunt .\"    \"Certes,\" seide the mayden, \"so shall I\nwith goode chere.\"  \"Also,\" quod Merlin, \"be ye eny clerk, and I shall teche yow so many merveilles that neuer woman cowde\nso many.\" Quod the maiden, \"How knowe ye that I am a clerke?\"\n\"Damesell,\" qoud Merlin, \"I knowe it well, ffor my\nmaister hath me so well taught that I knowe alle thinges that\noon doth.\"  \"Certes,\" seide the mayden, \"that is the moste\nconnynge that euer I herde, and moste myster were ther-of in\nmany places, and that I wolde faynest lerne; and of thinges that\nbe to come knowe ye ought?\"  \"Certes,\" quod he, \"swete love,\nyee, a grete part.\"  \"God mercy!\" quod the mayden, \"what go\nye than sechynge.\"  \"Truly,\" qoud Merlin, \"of that ye moste\nyet a-bide yef it be youre plesier.\"  And while the Mayden and\nMerlin helde this Parlement, assembled a-gein the maidenes and\nthe ladyes, and wente daunsinge and bourdinge toward the foreste\nfro whens thei were come firste; and whan thei were nygh thei\nentred in so sodaynly, that oon ne wiste where thei were be-come;\nbut the orcharde a-bode stille ther longe tyme, ffor the maiden\nthat swetly ther-of hym praide, and was cleped ther by name the\nrepeire of ioye and of feeste.  And whan Merlin and the maiden\nhadde be longe to-geder, Merlin seyde at the laste, \"Ffeire maiden,\nI go, for I haue moche to do in other place than here.\" \"How,\" qoud the maiden, \"feire frende, shull ye not teche\nme firste some of youre pleyes?\"  \"Damesell,\" quod\nMerlin, \"ne haste yow not sore, ffor ye shull know I-nowe all in\ntyme, ffor I moste haue ther-to grete leyser and grete soiour, and\non that other side I haue yet no suerte of youre love.\"  \"Sir,\"\nqoud she, \"what suerte wolde ye aske? devise ye, and I shall it\nmake.\"  \"I will,\" quod Merlin, \"that ye me ensure that youre love\nshall be myn, and ye also for to do my plesier of what I will.\"  And\nthe maiden her be-thought a litill, and than she seide, \"Sir,\" quod\nshe, \"with goode will by soche forwarde, that after that ye haue\nme taught all the thinges that I shall yow aske, and that I can\nhem werke.\"  And Merlin seide that so it plesed hym\nwell.  Than he a-sured the maiden to holde couenaunt like as she hadde devised, and he toke hire surete.  Than he taught hir\nther a pley that she wrought after many tymes, ffor he taught\nhir to do come a grete river ouer all ther as her liked, and to\na-bide as longe as she wolde; and of other games I-nowe,\nwhere-of she wrote the wordes in perchemyn soche as he hir\ndevised, and she it cowde full well bringe it to ende.  And whan\nhe hadde a-biden ther till euesonge tyme, he comaunded hir to god\nand she hym, but er he departed the maiden hym asked whan he\nsholde come a-gein; and he seide on seint Iohnes even; and thus\ndeparted that oon fro that other.  And Merlin went to Tamelide,\nwhere the kynges made hym grete ioye whan that thei hym\nsaugh.  But now a-while we moste cesse here, and speke of the\nmessage that the kynge de Cent chiualiers sent to speke with the\nPrinces by the counseile of the kynge cleped Tradilyuaunt, of\nNorth wales.", "19": "CHAPTER XX MEETING OF THE PRINCES AT LEICESTER; RETURN OF MERLIN TO THE COURT OF LEODOGAN; BETROTHAL OF ARTHUR AND GONNORE; AND GREAT BATTLE WITH KING RION AND THE GIANTS So well spedde the messagers of the kynge de Cent chiualiers\nand haue tolde theire message that thei were with charged\nto the princes, and this was theire ansuere, \"That thei seide thei\nwolde speke to-geder at whitsontyde at leycestre.\"  And thei\ndrough to-geder as secretly as thei myght, and ther thei\ncounseilled what thei sholde do, and lete wite that to that other.  And\nwhen thei were mette at leycestre thei made ech of other grete\nioye at her metinge, and after mete thei tolde of the trouble and\nthe damages that the saisnes hem hadde don, and thei fonde that\nthe kynge Aguysans hadde moste I-loste than alle the other; and\nther hym playned moche the kynge loot of his childeren and of\nhis wif that he hadde loste, and seide that he hadde leuer be deed\nthan lyve in that langour. Than spake the kynge de Cent Chiualiers, by whos counseile\nthei were ther assembled, and seide, \"Feire lordes, were\nit not better that we wente alle to dye with goode herte in the\nservise of oure lorde, and a-venge our deth and the deth of oure\nfrendes and of oure kyn, than to dye as cowardes shrewdely oon\nwith-oute a-nother, and to be in soche dolour as we ben euery day,\nffor yef the saisnes holde vs thus short thei shull distroie oure\nvitaile and the Iustice that vs gynneth.

And whan thei hadden spoken\nbe-twene hem thei acorded to that hadde seide; and than thei\ntoke day to assemble with all the peple that thei myght viij dayes\nbe-fore the Magdaleyn, in the medowes by suret, a Castell of the\nDukes of Cambenyk, that was right plentevouse and riche.  Than\ndeparted thei oon from a-nother, and wente in to theire londes, and\nassembled as moche peple as thei myght of frendes and cosins,\nsomme for preyer and some be force, and labored till thei come in\nto the medowes of lauerep, and ther thei pight tentes and\npavilouns be-twene tweyne armes of a river that was right grete, that\ncom oute of the see and ran also in to the see, and the booke it\nclepeth the river Sevarne, by a forest that is called Bregnehan,\nthat is right plentevouse and riche, and ther thei a-bide that oon\nthe tother, and a-raied theire peple, and scowred hauberkes and\nfurbisshed swerdes and helmes, and to sette sharp stiell vpon\ntheire launces.  But of hem now resteth a-while the tale, and speketh of Merlyn, that is departed fro Nimiame, from the foreste\nof Briogne. Whan Merlin was departed from this maiden, that he hadde\nyoven to his love, that the same nyght he com to\nToraise in Tamelide, where as the kynges were of hym right\ngladde and ioyfull, and sore hem longed hym for to seen, ffor the\nkynge leodogan hadde so spedde that his men were come, and\na-bide the hour that the hoste sholde assemble for to go a-reise\nthe kynge Rion be-fore the Citee of nablaise, where he lay at\nsege.  Than the thre kynges toke Merlin in counseile, and seide,\n\"Merlin, what shall we do, the hoste shall meve hastely?\"  \"I\nshall telle yow,\" seide Merlin, \"what ye shull do.  Go and sey\nto the kynge leodogan that he do ordeyne his peple to bataile,\nand devise his wardes, and sette yow on wey the morowe after\nPentecoste, that oon after that other, and doth wisely that all day\nx knyghtes wele horsed go be-fore the hoste, that shull serche the\ncontrey and the londe as thei gon, and take alle the asspies\nwhere-of ther ben many entred in to the londe to enquere of the\nrule of vs; and a-noon lete hem be slayn or sette in prison that\nthei may no-thinge discure, and ride euer be nyght and by the\nmoste vn-cowth weyes that ye may, and I my-self shall yow\ncondite in the firste fronte, ffor ye and youre companye and the\nknyghtes of the rounde table shull be in oon warde to-geder\nwithoute eny other peple, and that shall be the firste bataile.\" Whan thei hadde longe thus spoken, the kynge Arthur asked\ntidinges of his londe how thei hadde seth don.  And\nhe tolde hem alle the auuentures that hadde ben in the reme of\nlogres seth he departed from hym, and how alle the childeren\nwere assembled; and after he tolde how that the sones of kynge\nloot hadde rescowed theire moder from the saisnes, and tolde how\nthe bretheren hadde seide how the kynge loot theire fader sholde\nneuer haue a-gein his wif in companye, ne their frende he shall\nnot be, till he haue made a-corde with yow.  And the kynge\nArthur was ther-of right gladde, and be-gan to laughe for ioye,\nand thanke hym of that seruyse.  Aftre that he turned to the\nkynge Ban and towarde the kynge Boors.  \"And ye, feire lordes,\" quod Merlin, \"how shull ye do? ffor ye haue a werke towarde, and\nthat right grete, where-as ye shall haue grete peyne and traueyle, an\nI shall telle yow what.\"  And that he tolde how Claudas de la desert\nhadde wrought, and how ffrolles and Pounces and Antoneyes com\nwith a grete hoste for to take her londe and it to distroie; \"and I\nhaue seth,\" quod he, \"ben there and spoke with leonce of Paerne,\nyoure cosin, that sendeth yow gretinge by me, and I haue tolde\nhym the ordenaunce of hem that come to distroye the londes. Whan thei herde Merlin thus speke thei were so hevy and\nso pensef that thei wiste not what to sey ne do.  Whan\nthe kynge Arthur saugh hem so enterprised, he be-gan for to wepe\nwith this yien, and seide to Merlin, \"Ha, feire swete frende, haue\npyte of hem and of her londes and sette soche counseile as ye\nknowe is myster, ffor I wote wele yef ye hem faile thei haue all\nloste; ne I shall neuer than haue ioye in my lif tyme.\"  \"Certes,\"\nquod Merlin, \"thei shull not drede to be distroied while I am in\nher companye, and I do yow to wete that to yow and to hem\nencreseth moche werke and besynesse euery day, ffor the grete\ndragon, as seith the prophesie shall com to chase the lyon crowned\noute of the bloy breteigne, with the helpe that he shall haue of\nxxix serpentes that shull be merveillouse grete and stronge, that\nshall be so grete and fierce, and moche he shall hym peyne, and a\npartie he shall haue of the grete serpentes crowne, to whom alle the\nbeestes of the bloy bretaigne and of Tamelide shull enclyne a partie\nfor his fiercenesse and his grete prowesse, but yet is not born the\nleopart by whiche the lyon shall be sustened that the grete dragon\nshall no power haue hym to enchase from his conuersacion.\" Whan the thre kynges herde Merlin thus speke, thei were\nsore a-baisshed, for neuer herde thei hym so derkely\nspeke, and asked and enquered of hym what it mente; and he\nseide that thei sholde no more wite at that tyme; \"but thus\nmoche I sey to the kynge Arthur, that the grete of this mater\nlongeth vn-to hym.\"  And ther-with thei cessed of this matere;\nand than the kynge Ban hym asked what was his counseile, and\nhow he sholde his londe socoure.  And Merlin seide that yet\nshulde thei wite no worde, \"but as soone,\" quod Merlin, \"as ye haue holpen to chase these sarazins out of this contrey, hit\nbehoveth vs to move with as moche peple as we may haue in this\nreame, and we shull go by logres, the stronge Cite of kynge\nArthurs, and by the Castell of Bredigan, and take the tresour\nthat is grete in the foreste denoyable, where ther be xij of the\nbeste swerdes that eny man knoweth in eny londe; and with hem\nshall the kynge Arthur dubbe his nevewes, that for hym haue\nlefte fader and moder and kyn and frendes, and hem shall we\nlede with vs in to the reame of Benoyk, ffor thei that com\nthiderwarde ben grete nombre; and whan the bataile is fynysshed, in\nthe soiour that we shull make in the londe, shall the gret leopart\nbe engendred, that shall be so prowde and fierce, by whom the\ndragon of the fer oute ylles shall drawe hym a-bakke from the\nlyon crowned of the bloy bretaigne, that noon harm he ne shall\nhym don, and yet he shall well ther-to haue power, but in the fyn\nhe shall hym Iustice so that he shall make hym come on his knee\nas in maner to crie mercy be-fore the crowned lyon.\"  \"Sir,\"\nquod the kynge Ban, \"as for that we be come hider, knowe ye\nof that what shall be-falle?\"  \"Of that haue ye no doute,\"\nquod Merlin, \"that er we departe all this contrey shall be in the\nhandes of the kynge Arthur.\"  \"Sir,\" quod the kynge Ban, \"of\nthese derke wordes that ye haue remembered that we vndirstonde\nnought, shull ye ought to vs tellen.\"  \"Nay,\" quod Merlin,\n\"but thus moche I sey to the kynge Arthur, that all this shall\nfalle in his tyme.\"  With that ther entred in a massager, and\nasked where were the sowdiours, and oo hym taught in to a\nchamber wher thei were yet in counseile, and he wente thider,\nand he was right wise and eloquent, and a moche knyhgt and a\nfeire, and cosin germain to the kynge leodogan, and his name was\nGuyomar, and was of xxv yere of age; and this Guyomar caused\nafterwarde the reame of logres to be in grete trouble, by whom\nthe knyghtes of the rounde table hadde after soche peyne and\nlabour for the damage that the quene Gonnore hym dide, for the\nlove of Morgain, the suster of kynge Arthur, that so moche hym loved that the quene a-reisede so grete blame, as the tale shall\nreherse here-after whan the tyme cometh to speke of that matier. Whan Guyomar com in to the chamber the kynges departed\nfrom counseile, and com be-fore theym, and hem salued\nfrom the kynge leodogan, \"and sent yow to seyn that ye sholde\ncome speke with hym;\" and thei ansuerde thei wolde with goode\nwill.  Than thei asked their horse and wente to Court; but\nthei were not so sone a-light at the halle, but the kynge leodogan\ncom hem a-geins, and toke hem be the handes, and ledde hem in\nto a chamber for to counseile to-geder.  Than spake the kynge\nleodogan as he that was right a wise man and well lerned, and\nther were no moo but the fyve only, and than he seide, \"Feire\nlordes, I holde yow full noble and worthi men and trewe, and\nknoweth it well that I love yow right hertely more than ye wene,\nand that I ought of right for to do, for ye haue saued my lif and\nmy londe and myn honoure, and I ne wote not what ye be, and\nthat me sore for-thinketh, ffor ther is no-thinge that I wolde so\ngladly knowe; but I shall wite whan yow lyketh, for other-wise\nI will not of yow desire, and I wolde yow asken what we shull\ndo, for ye knowe well how that the kynge Rion is entred in to\nmy londe, and hath be-seged oon of my beste Citees with the\npower of xx crowned kynges, and eche of hem hath at his baner\nxx Ml men; and on that other side my peple is here assembled,\nbut thei ben so fewe that thei may not compare with hem, and\ntherfore I aske yow counseile how we may beste be gouerned,\nffor I putte me all hooll in youre ordenaunce.\" Than spake Merlin to the kynge, and seide, \"Sir, dismay\nyow nothinge, ffor be the feith that I owe vn-to yow er\nthat the kynge Rion from yow ascape he wolde haue ben in hys\ncontre all naked by the Condicion that it hadde coste hym the\nbeste Citee that he hath.

And the two kynges\ncom first be-fore hym and dide hym homage, and after the kynge\nleodogan and alle the other barouns, and thei made the feste of the\nmariage so riall that neuer in that londe was seyn soche; but ouer\nalle other was the quene Gonnore gladde of hir newe lorde.  And\nthat nyght Merlin lete hym-self be knowen of the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table with-oute eny moo.  And whan the kynge\nleodogan hym knewe he seide that god in this worlde hadde sente hym\ngoode eure, that to so noble and worthi man hadde hym yove the\nlove and a-queyntanse, \"and from hens-forth, gode lorde god, do\nwith me thy wille, seth my londe and my doughter is be sette in so noble wise to the worthiest of the worlde.\"  Thus seide the\nkynge leodogan, and than after thei yede to bedde for to reste;\nand on the morowe the kynge sente the knyghtes in to tho parties\nas Merlin hym taught, where as the peple of kynge Rion sholde\nassemble, and than devised his wardes of his bataile where-of\nwere x. In the firste warde, where as the dragon was, was the kynge\nArthur and the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors and her\nxl felowes, and so were the knyghtes of the rounde table, and so\nmany of other that thei were vij Ml men right well armed; and the\nseconde warde ledde Guyomar, the kynges cosin, with vij Ml men\nof armes; the thridde warde ledde Elunadas, a yonge lorde that\nwas nevew to the wise lady of the foreste saunz retour; the\nfourthe bataile ledde Blios, the lorde of Cloadas, a merveillouse\ncastell, and were with hym vij Ml men of armes and horse of prise;\nthe v warde ledde Aridolus, a knyght of grete renoun, and weren\nalso vij Ml men; the sixte bataile ledde Belcys li loys, that was\nI-nough riche and puyssaunt, and hadde with hym also vij Ml men of armes well horsed; the vij bataile ledde ydiers, of\nthe londe of Norwey, to whom the feire a-venture fell in the\ncourte of kynge Arthur, of the v ringes that he drough oute of\nthe deed knyghtes honde that asked vengaunce, that neuer knyght\nthat was in that court myght haue, as the tale shall yow declare\nhere-after; and he hadde in hys companye vij Ml , and he was a\nnoble knyght and an hardy.  The viij th bateile ledde landons, the\nnevew of the stiward of Tamelide, that was a full noble knyght\nof his honde, and he ledde vij Ml in his companye soche as he hadde\nbrought; the ix th bateile ledde Groinge poire mole, that was a\nnoble knyght of his body, but he hadde no gretter nose than a cat;\nthis chese oute vij Ml in whom he trusted; and the x th bataile\nledde the kynge leodogan and his stiwarde Cleodalis, that right\nwele cowde hym helpe, and were in her companye x Ml what oon\nand other, that wolde not fle for lif ne lym.  Whan these batailes\nwere disseuered that oon from that other and renged by hem-self,\nthei devised whan thei shulde meve; and thus thei acorded, that\non the morowe after Pentecoste thei shulde move at the firste cok crowynge; and than thei rested all day and on the morn, ffor\non the witsonday the kynge leodogan helde court roiall for love\nof the barouns that ther were assembled; and the thre kynges\nand Merlin satte to-geder at the hede of the deyse, and be-fore\nhem satte the two Gonnores, that were wonder like, saf a litill\nthat oon was heigher and fressher coloured, and that was Arthurs\nwif, and the better tonge she hadde, ffor she was of all the worlde\nthe feirest speker and the beste, and also she hadde more heer\nthan the tother Gonnore, but of alle other thinges thei resembled\nso like that vn-ethe myght oon knowe that oon from that\nother.  And after satte the felowes that Arthur hadde brought with the\nknyghtes of the rounde table for chierte and gret love, ffor so\nwolde Merlin and Gynebans the clerke.  And whan thei hadde\neten thei wente to bedde, but litill while thei lay, for thei roos at\nmydnyght. Whan the armes of kynge Arthur were brought, Gonnore\nhym helped for to arme right wele and feire, as she\nthat right wele cowde her ther-of entermete, and hir-self girde\nhym with his swerde; and whan the kynge was all armed saf his\nhelme she toke the spores and sette hem on bothe knelinge; and\nMerlin, that all this be-hilde, be-gan to laughe, and shewde to\nthe two kynges how Gonnore hir entermeted and peyned hym to\nserue; and hir preised moche the twey kynges.  But in the fin\nshe hadde a riche guerdon whan she loste the kynge hir lorde by\nmysauenture and by Bertelanx, the traitour, as the book shall\nre-herse here-after; and while Merlin be-heilde the maiden that\nserued hir lorde, he lough and seide to the kynge, as he that cowde\nall goode and full well cowde Iape in myrthe and game, \"Sir sire,\nnever were ye so verily a newe knyght as ye be now, and ther ne\nfaileth but o thinge that ye were alle a newe knyght; and well may\nye sey whan ye departe hens that a maiden that is kynges doughter\nand quenes hath made yow a newe knyght.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the\nkynge, \"sey what thinge that is and my lady shall it do, but\nyef it be to grete a thinge or that she sholde ther-by haue\nshame.'  \"Certes, sire,\" seide the maiden full wisely, as she that full well\nlerned, \"in nothinge that I do to yow may I haue no shame ne vilonye, ffor I knowe yow so noble and worthy and also curteyse\nthat ye wolde me not requere nothinge that to vilonye shulde\nturne for the beste castell that ye haue.\"  \"Lady,\" seide Merlin,\n\"ye sey wisely; neuer for nothinge that I haue seide shall ye\nhaue no reprof ne that sholde turne yow to no shame.\"  \"What\nis it than?\" seide the kynge, \"I pray yow telle me.\"  \"Sir,\"\nseide Merlin, \"hit is the baisyers, yef to the lady it\nplese.\"  \"Certes,\" seide the kynge, \"and for that shall I not leve to be a\nnewe made knyght.\"  \"No,\" quod the maiden, \"as for that\nshall I yow not lese, but that ye shull be myn and I yowrs; and\nwhy sholde ye ther-of me preyen, for also well it pleseth me as\nit doth to yow.\"  Whan the kynge herde hir thus sey he be-gan to\nlaugh; than the kynge toke hir in armes, and kissed hir swetly\nas yonge peple that full well to-geder loved.  And than were the\nhorse apareiled and brought forth; and Gonnore yaf hir lorde an\nhelme of merveillouse bountee, and he sette it on his heed; and\nthan ech comaunded other to god, and rode forth eche warde\nafter other, the ganfanouns folden and the speres lowe, and rode\na softe pas as Merlin hym guyded as he that wele knewe alle the\npassages; and the x knyghtes that were gon be-fore hadde taken\nmo than x pantoneres, that alle weren espies of the kynge Rion,\nand bounde hem and sette hem in prison, and kepte so well the\npassages that thei herde no tidinges. And so well spedde hym Merlin that the firste warde dide\ncondite that thei come the wednysday at nyght after the\nmydnyght in to the hoste of kynge Rion; and the nyght was\nright clere and stille, but the moone shone a litill trouble.  And\nthei slepte strongeliche in the hoste ffor the tyme that relented,\nffor on the day was right grete hete in the hoste, and ther-to thei\nhadden dronken I-nough.  And Merlin sette in be-twene the\nwode and the river, and comaunded that no man presse in to the\nhoste till that thei herde an horne blowe; and as the wardes\npasseden ouer oon after a-nother, Merlin a-bode hem alle, and\nmade hem close to-geder; and than wente Merlin to the baner,\nand toke an horne and blewe it so lowde that all the foreste and\nthe river resownnded that a man myght heere the horne well half a myle.  Than Merlin cried, \"Lady seint Marie, praye to oure\nlorde god, thi blissed sone, that he now be oure helpe.\"  \"Now\nsette on manly,\" quod he, \"gentill knyghtes, ffor now shall it be\nsein who is noble and worthi, ffor I do yow to wete that ye\nbe alle at the deth or at the lif, and noon ne hath no heede\nbut he hit now deffende.\"  And whan thei herde the horne\na-noon thei slaked theire reynes and spored theire horse and\nsmote in to the hoste with grete ravyne; and ther ye sholde\nhaue sein tentes and pavilouns reverse to the grounde, ffor Merlin\nby crafte made soche a trobellion a-rise that ther lefte nother\ntente ne pavilon stondinge, but fellen vpon theire heedes that lay\nwith-ynne; and thei smyten in to the hoste on alle parties, and\nslowgh and maymed what thei myght a-reche, ffor ther was made\nof hem grete slaughter er thei were a-parceyved in the hoste what\npeple thei were, till that thei herde the brayes and the dolerouse\ncries as thei weren slain and mangeled of hem that of hir deth\nhadde no pitee.  Than comaunded the heigh lordes to theire\nsquyres to make theire horse redy thourgh the hoste, and thei so\ndide, and than thei ronne to armes hastely, and peyned hem harde\nto be smartly armed and soone; and as soone as thei myght be\narmed thei assembled at the tente of kynge Rion, and blowen\nhornes and trumpes right harde.  And the cristin hadde so hurled\na-monge hem vp and down that mo than thre thousande thei\nhadde so araied that neuer repeired thens, and chase the remenaunt\nto kynge Rions tente; ther thei made hir gaderinge, and ther\nthei stalled, for thei were moche peple and stronge; and than\narmed hem thei that were not armed, and tho apered the feire\nday and cleire, and than the wardes drowen vp and appereilled\nhem in ordre, and eche gadered his peple a-boute hym, and ther\nthei reised theire baners a-lofte that flekered in the wynde, and\nthe bright soone smote vpon the bright armurs that it glistered so\nbright that merveile was to be-holden. Whan the kynge Rion saugh the damage that thei hadde\nhym don he was nygh wode for ire, and satte vpon a\ngrete horse that was wonder stronge and swight, and hadde an ax\nhanginge at his sadill be-fore, that was grete and hevy of harde stiell, and rode so vp and down, devisinge who sholde go be-fore\nand who sholde go be-hynde; and than he cleped Solynas, a knyght\nof grete prowese and right hardy, that was his nevew, and seide,\n\"Solinas, thow shalt lede the firste bataile with an hundred\nthousande men of armes of soche peple as ye will, and thow shalt go\nand a-venge my shame and youre harmes.\"  And he seide he\nwolde well so that he wolde deserue of hym no blame.  Than\ndeparted he that was wight and hardy and merveillouse stronge;\nand as soone as Merlin saugh hym come he rode hym a-geins with\nthe dragon, and he hym disfigured in soche manere that no man\nsaugh who it bar saf the thre kynges.  Whan Merlin saugh that\nhe com nygh, he seide to the kynge Arthur, \"Arthur,\" quod he,\n\"now shall it be sene how well ye shull do, and loke that the\nkisse that youre love yow yaf be to somme solde so dere that euer\nafter ther-of be spoken.\"  And he ansuerde a-gein and seide that\nin hym sholde be no feyntise, and no more he ne seide.  And\nthan approched that oon bataile to that other right nygh, and\nthan thei leide theire speres in fewtre, and mette to-geder with\ntrenchaunt heedes vpon the sheldes that ech hurte other and\nwounded and bar to the grounde; ther dide the kynge Arthur a\npointe that moche was be-holden. Whan Arthur saugh bothe partyes so nygh approche, he\nsmote the horse with the spores a-gein Ionap, a grete\nGeaunt and merveillous stronge; and he saugh hym so come he\ndouted hym but litill, for he semed a-gein hym but a\nchielde.  Thei com faste and rudely, and Arthur was smyte with Ionappes\nspere in the shelde so rudely that the shafte passed thourgh his\nlifte flanke an arme lengthe; and Arthur smote hym a-gein so\nsore that thourgh shelde and sholdre he shof the trenchaunt\nspere, but the sarazin was so proude and of so grete strength\nthat he made no semblaunt of no greuaunce, but hurteled to-geder\nso rudely with theire bodyes and with the myght of theire horse\nthat eche bar other to erthe and the horse vpon theire bodyes, and\nther thei lay a longe while sore astonyed, that the ton cowde telle\nno tidinges of the tother.  Than ronne to the rescowse on bothe\ntwo sides; ther was many a grete spere crased and stronge stour of swerdes upon helmes and sheldes.  Ther loste the Geauntes more\nthan the cristin, but, neuertheles, thei traueyled so on bothe parties\nthat bothe were thei releved and sette on horse, and than be-gan\nthe stoure stronge and merveillouse; ther dide the knyghtes of the\nrounde table wondres, and the xl felowes, ffor a-gein hem myght\nendure noon harneys, ne no kynge, ne warde, ne sheltron, were\nit neuer so clos, and drof hem to the standerd, and were so\naffraide the meyne of Solinas that thei ne entended but for to\nfleen; and the cristin hem enchased and driven in a-monge hem so\nharde that alle the renges dide fremysh, and ther be-gan the\nchaplee so mortall that neuer was sein more mortalite; grete\nprowesse ther dide the knyghtes of the rounde table, but of alle\nother ther dide well a yonge knyght, that ought well to be\nrehersed in the storye, for he ought not to be for-yeten but to be\nremembred what he was and what was his name, ffor he was the\nbeste that euer was in the tyme of Vterpendragon and in the\ntyme of kynge Arthur, as longe as hym liked for to use and to\nhaunte chiualrie. The storye seith that he was cosin germain vn-to Percevall de\ngaloys vpon his moder side, of whom this booke shall\nspeke here-after whan the matier cometh ther-to; and also the\nbooke seith that this knyght was nygh to Ioseph\nAbaramathie, for he was the sone of Enhyngnes, the soster of Ioseph,\nthat was the wif wedded to Ebron, that hadde xij sones, where-of\nthe londe of Bretaigne was after enlumyned, and next cosin to\nSelydoyne, the sone of Duke Nascien de breting, that the grete\nmerveile of the graal saugh firste, and also a-pertened to kynge\nPelles of lytenoys and his brethren.  This knyght hadde after\nGalaad, the sone of launcelot, many a day in his kepinge, wher-of\nthe boke shall reherse here-after of alle thinges oon after a-nother\nas thei fill day be day.  This knyght of whom I haue so spoken\nwas cleped Nascien ffor love of the duke Nascien, that was so\nnoble a knyght, and he was after of so gode lyvinge whan he\nhadde lefte chivalrie that he be-com an hermyte; and oure lorde\nhym visited and loved so that he was a preste and seide messe,\nand was also a mayden and chaste as longe as he leved; and this same knyght was after ravisshed be the holy goste in to the\nthridde heuene, where he saugh a-pertely the fader, sone, and holy\ngoste.  This knyght hadde after the storie in his kepinge, and\nwrote with his owne hande by comaundement of the grete\nmaister; and that he dide write he anexed to the booke that\nBlase wrote, the holy hermyte, by the techinge of Merlin.  This\nknyght yaf afterwarde, whan he was hermyte, the noble\ncounseile to kynge Arthur whan he was in pereile to lese his londe, in\nthe tyme of Galehant, the lorde of the fer oute yles, that werred\nvpon Arthur with the power of xxx kynges that he hadde alle\nconquered.  But now resteth the tale to speke of thise thinges,\nand returneth to telle how thei dide in the bataile. Full grete and harde was the bataile, the thursday after\npentecoste, of the peple of kynge Rion of Denmarke and of\nIslonde, a-gein the peple of the reame of Tamelide, and ther the\nknyghtes of the rounde table shewde merveilouse prowesse in\narmes, but a-boven alle other well dide this Nascien and\nAdragayn li bruns: these tweyne dide merveillouse prowesses: these\ntweyne brake the sheltrouns with strokes of swerdes, and with\nhem also the kynge Arthur.  These thre hilde companye to-geder\nthat thei haue loste all theire felowes, and what wey that euer\nthei yede euer hem gyded the baner of the dragon, and sore\npeyned alle the tother felowes for to folowe the baner, but the\nsarazins were so many and so thikke that thei myght hem not\npersh ne breke, but nede moste thei ruse, and leve place wheder\nthei wolde or noon; and these thre be lefte a-monge hem that\nsore laboured er thei myght come to the standerd where the baner\nwaved of the kynge Rion in the wynde that was grete and born\nvp with iiij Olyfauntes; and on that other side the kynge Ban\nand the kynge Boors saugh how thei haue loste the kynge Arthur,\nand that the Geauntes have hym for-closed, thei lete renne theire\nhorse and lefte theire felowes, and gerden in to the presse, with\nswerdes drawen, and slowen and casten down all that thei myght\natteigne, ne neuer cessed hem to percen and thriste thourgh till\nthei com to Merlin, that hilde the baner be-fore the kynge\nArthur.  And whan the v felowes weren to-geder and hir banerer that hem gided, than be-gan the medle so cruwell, that oon for that other,\nthat merveile it was to be-holde.  Than fill it that the kynge\nRion com that wey, his ax in his honde, and he was the moste\nman and the grettest of corsure of the worlde, and happed that\nhe mette firste in his wey the kynge Boors, that chased the kynge\nSaron with swerde drawen, that a merveillous stroke he hadde\nhym yoven with a spere thurgh the shelde, that ner he hadde\nhym felled to grounde, but as he kepte hym by the arson of his\nsadell, and with-oute faile hadde not the spere broken he hadde\nfalle to grounde; and as soone as the spere was spente the kynge\nBoors redressed hym in his sadell and ficched hym so in his\nsteropes so harde that the Iren bente, and he hilde his swerde\nnaked, and clipte his shelde to his breste, and ran to the Geaunte,\nand whan the Geaunte saugh hym come he fledde, for he durste\nhym not a-bide; and the kynge Boors hym pursude that loth was\nhym to leve, and of that dide he grete folye, ffor he hadde paste\nhis felowes the space of a bowe draught, and thei ne myght not\nhym ouer-take; and than happed hym mette the kynge Rion,\nthat com ridinge wonder faste, with all the force of xvij kynges\ncrowned, and alle were thei hardy knyghtes and sure in armes,\nand the kynge Rion rode be-fore the caste of a ston, and helde in\nhis hande a grete malle of brasse, and he was grete and stronge,\nand sat vpon a stronge horse and a grete, and mette the kynge\nBoors, that chased the kynge Saron, and hilde hym so straite\nthat he smote hym vpon the helme that he made hym stoupe on\nthe arson of the sadell, and as he sholde haue recouerd a-nother\nstroke to smyte of the hede, the horse that he satte on caught the\nbridell with the teth, and bar hym ferther than he wolde, the kynge,\nthat smote with so grete myght, myght not with-drawe his\nstroke, but hitte ther as he wolde not haue smyten, ffor he smote\nof the horse hede of the kynge Saron faste by the eeres, that\nbothe the horse and the hover fill to the erthe, and than Boors\nrode ouer hym, and fayn wolde haue light yef he hadde\nleyser.  But the kynge Rion that com fer be-fore cried, and seide, \"Sir\nknyght, so fer haste thow gon that late it is to repente, for he is\nlonginge to me, and ther-fore I com hym for to chalenge, and thow shalt wite yef be-twene hym and me were eny love.\"  Than\nhe spored his horse harde that the blode sterte oute on bothe two\nsides, and he ran so swyfte that the felde that was full of smale\ncaliouns that the fire sparkeled thikke, and the kynge Boors\nbehilde and saugh come the grete Geaunte so nygh that he myght\nnot glenche a-side on no parte, and saugh come so grete foyson of\npeple after hym that all the felde was couered, and saugh well\nyef he a-bode he were in grete a-uenture of deth, and than he\nseide a-gein, \"A mercy lorde god, for yef I go thus shall I neuer\nhaue honour, ffor euer it shall be to me reprof and holde\ncowardise, and yet hadde I leuer to dye with worship than lyve with\nshame; now god do with me his plesier,\" quod he, \"for I will\na-bide.\"  Than he made vpon hym the signe of the very crosse,\nand hilde his swerde in his honde that was of grete bounte, and\nbode hym that com prikinge thourgh the playn.  Whan the kynge\nRion com to the kynge Boors he threw down his launce, and yaf\nhym soche a stroke with the brasen betell so vn-mesurable, that\nner he hadde hym encombred, but he kepte the stroke vpon his\nshelde, and Rion smote so rudely that it fill in peces, and Boors\nenterpassaunt hit hym on the helme with his swerde so fiercely\nthat he bente on his horse croupe.  Whan the sarazin saugh that\nhe hadde of hym failed, he returned a-gein with his betill of\nbrasse, and the kynge Boors that saugh come so grete foison of\npeple and the kynge Rion that hilde hym so shorte, he thought\nit foly to a-bide lenger.  Than he priked bakke in to the presse,\nand saugh how the kynge Aroans helde hervy the rivell by the\nnasell of the helme vpon fote, and hadde hym so beten, he and\nhis men, that the blode ran oute of mouthe and nose, and thei\nhadde his hede smeten of ne hadde be Adragain li bruns, that full\nsore hym deffended a-gein mo than an hundred, but in short tyme\nhe moste haue be slayn, whereof hadde be grete damage, ne\nhadde be the kynge Boors, that com and saugh hervy at that\nmyschef, and was ther-fore full sory; and than he priked his horse\ntoward Aroans and smote hym vpon the helme that he fill flatte\nto grounde all a-stonyed.  And whan hervy saugh hym so\ndelyuered, he hente the horse and lepte vp lightly, and ran in to the presse that dide sore encrese and enforse, ffor all the x wardes\nof the kynge leodogan were flusshed to the standerd that the\nkynge Rion dide condite, that hadde chaced the kynge Boors till\nhe com in to the bataile ther he hadde felled the kynge Aroant,\nand as soone as he hym saugh he ran vpon hym with his betill in\nhis honde and wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, and whan he\nsaugh the stroke come and that he hade no shelde, he spored\nforth his horse, and Ryon smote so rudely that the stroke fill\nbetwene the horse croupe and the sadell that brake the horse chyne,\nand bar bothe to the erthe, that oon vpon that other bothe vpon an\nhepe.  Than the kynge boors lepte on foote, for he was a knyght\nhardy and sure, and the presse was so thikke a-boute hym, that\nvn-ethe myght he hym turne, ffor so grete plente of peple sued\nthe kynge Rion, that no man myght hem nombre, that smote\nvpon hem so sore that the cristin rused more than a bowe\nshote.  Ther was Boors full sore greved, for the kynge Rion peyned hym\nsore to smyte of his hede; and whan hervy de rivell saugh the\ngoode man at so grete myschef, for he hadde sein hym thries\nvpon his knees fallen and a-rise vpon his palmes, he rode that\nwey hym for to socoure, and caught a grete stronge spere oute of\na sarazins handes, and smote the kynge Rion thourgh the shelde\nand hauberke and the lifte sholdre, but it perced not the\nflessh.  Ne for no stroke that he yaf the kynge not meved more ne lesse,\nbut lifte vp the betill where-with he hadde many a cristin slain,\nand wende smyte hervy vpon the helme, but he hym covered with\nhis shelde, and the stroke com so harde that a quarter fill to the erthe,\nand whan he wolde it recover as he that was of right grete forse,\nand hervy was full of grete vigour, and hilde his swerde drawen,\nand wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, and the kynge caste\nhis shelde ther a-geins, and hervy hym smote so sore that he slitte\nit to the bokle, and the kynge lefte vp agein the betill and wolde\nhaue smyte hym vpon the helme, and hervy plukked his reyne\na-bakke, for sore he douted the stroke of the grete Geaunte, and\nhe failed of hym, and smote the horse be the paytrell and braste\nthe nekke a-sonder, that to grounde fill the horse and his maister,\nand whan Adragain saugh his felow fallen, it was no nede to aske yef he were dolent.  Than he drough that wey with his swerde\nin his fiste, and smote so the kynge Rion, that he made hym\nbende on his horse nekke, and but as he enbrased his horse nekke\nhe hadde fallen to the erthe all vp-right, and yef Adragain hadde\nI-hadde leyser, taken hadde be the vengeaunce with-oute more\ntaryinge.  Whan the sarazins and the Geauntes saugh the kynge\nRion in soche pereill, thei were right wrorth.  Ther was a proude\nkynge that was cosin to the kynge Rion, that hight Solinas, that\nheilde a spere with an heede of steill: whan he saugh the kynge\nRion so euell I-ledde, it a-noyed hym sore, and than he spored his\nstede and smot Adragayn so rudely be-twene the two sholderes\nthat he bar hym to the erthe vp-right, but a-noon he lept on\nfoote.  And when the thre knyghtes saugh hem-self so at myschef,\nthei drough hem to-geder and foughten so harde that noon to\nprofer hys honde hem to take; and thei launched at hem dartes\nand gauellokes, and hurt and wounded hem in many places, but\nthei were of so high herte that nought thei sette of all that was\nther don, but slough and caste down all that thei myght\natteyne.  But the kynge Rion hem kepe so short that taken hadde thei ben,\nbut as Nascien com with a shorte spere in his honde all blody. Whan Nascien saugh the kynge Boors at soche myssese, and\nhis two felowes that he so loved, and saugh the kynge\nRion that sore hym peyned hem to damage, he smote his horse\nwith spores so harde that wey that down goth all that he mette\nin hys comynge with the breste of his horse, and braundisshed\nhis gleyve, and smote the kynge Rion so harde at discouert vpon\nthe lifte side that he bar hym to the erthe so a-stonyed that he\nwiste not whether it were day of nyght; and Nascien passed ouer\nhis body on horse-bak tweys or thryse, and than his men ronne\nto the rescowse, and ther was so grete prese of speres and swerdes\nthat Nasciens horse was slain vnder hym be-twene his legges;\nand ther were these iiij knyghtes at grete myssese and soone\nmyght haue be so grete damage that neuer myght haue be\nrestored; but Merlin, that alle these auentures knewe, com to\nkynge Arthur, and seide, \"Clepe the kynge Ban and the knyghtes\nof the rounde table and suweth me, ffor it is now grete nede, ffor the kynge Boors and thre knyghtes of the rounde table fightes,\nand alle iiij ben at grete myschief, ffor the kynge Rion hem\nkepeth so shorte that I loke but after the houre that thei sholde\nbe slain.\" Whan the kynge Ban vndirstode Merlin, all his body\ntrembled, and a-noon asked and seide, \"Ha! sir, telle me\nwhiche wey it is, ffor yef he dye shall I neuer haue ioye in my\nlyve.\"  \"Sue me than,\" quod Merlin, \"for it is no tyme for to\na-byde.\"  Than caste Merlin a-noon his enchauntement full\nmerveillous, for he made a-rise a tempest and a wynde so stronge that\nall the duste drof a-monge the saisnes so thikke that vn-nethe oon\nmyght knowe a-nother; and than a-roos the shoute so grete and\nthe noyse that noon myght here other.  Than turned Merlin the\ndragon in his honde so grete and so merveillouse that neuer was\nseyn noon soche be-fore, and caste fier and flame in to the aire so\ngrete and so merveillouse and so grete foison that all the aire\nwaxed all reade of the flawme, and ther fill a thousande of soche\nsparkeles of fire vpon theire helmes of the Sarazins and Geauntes,\nthat was a thinge that moche hem affraied. While that Merlin entended to breke the presse, com the\nmen of kynge Rion so grete plente that noon cowde\nhem nombre ne seye, and on that other side come the wardes of\nkynge leodogan and that oon smote a-gein that other alle\nto-geder.  Ther was a stour merveillouse and felon, ffor the cristin were at\ngrete myschef, ne it myght not longe haue endured ne hadde ben\nthe grete knowinge and witte of Merlin, in whom was all the\nrecouer, ffor for oon of the men kynge leodogan hadde kynge\nRion foure, but the cristin ben more noble and better I-armed and\nfeirer in ordenaunce ech at his baner.  Ffull grete was the bataile\nand the stour mortall be-fore the Citee of da Nablaise, for sore that\noo parte peyned to damage that other.  Ther the knyghtes of the\nrounde table so laboured and peyned hem to sue the baner where\nas Merlin it bar, for ther were so gret foyson of peple that vn-ethe\nwere thei seyn a-monge theire enmyes.  Ther dide merveilles the\nkynge Ban, for he hadde grete drede of his brother, and whiche\nwey that Merlin wente euer was Arthur with hym and his xl felowes and CC l knyghtes of the rounde table; a-gein these\nmyght no force of peple with-stonde, and so haue thei medled\nand styghtled till they haue founde the kynge Boors vpon foote,\nand his felowes so araied that theire helmes were slitte and\nquartered that it henge a-boute theire yeen so that it hem blynded,\nand theire hauberkes were so rente and torne in many places, but\nthei hadde yet no wounde that letted hem to bere armes, and thei\nhelde theire swerdes in bothe handes and merveillously hem\ndeffenden, ffor so many hadde thei slayn of men and of horse that\nthe mounteins of bodyes were a-boute hem so grete that noon\nmyght come to hem but launchinge; and the kynge Ryon hym\npeyned hem for to take and holde, ffor well he thought that thei\nwere high men and riche for the grete diffence that he saugh in\nhem and for the high hertes that thei hadden, and than he yaf\nhem a-gein a newe a-saute where thei alle hadde be loste hadde\nnot the socour haue come. Whan the kynge Ban saugh his brother in soche turment,\nffro whens he sholde neuer haue come oute hooll ne\nsounde yef thei ne hadde not comen ne the knyghtes that with\nhym weren, than he lete renne his horse that wey, and smote\nthe kynge Minap so thourgh the heede that he slitte hym to the\nbriste bon, and the kynge Arthur smote so a sarazin that he made\nthe heede falle be-fore the kynge Rion, and the other felowes\nsmote in so sore a-monge hem that ech bar his felowe deed to the\nerthe or elles wounded.  And whan the kynge Boors saugh the\nsocour come, he ioyned his feet and lept vpon the deed bodyes of\nmen and horse that he hadde slain, and ech of hem caught an\nhorse and lept vp lightly, and chaunged theire helmes a-noon in\ngrete haste, and after gate hem sheldes, and than rode in to the\nmedle with swerdes drawen.  Ther be-gan the stour newe full\nhidouse and fell, ffor thei braste and threst thourgh the batailes on alle parties and smyten down and slough all a-bowte, and\nthus the bataile endured all the day vnto lowe euesonge.  Than\nrused the cristin towarde the Cite of Danablaise, and the cry\na-ros so grete and the noyse and the shoute that all the cite ronne\nto the walles and saugh that the cristin hadde moche the werse. Whan Sadoynes the Castelein saugh the kynge leodogan, his\noncle, at soche myschef, and that thei were discounfited\nand driven from the place, ne hadde ben the kynge Arthur and\nhis companye, that were well CCC; these sustened so the bataile\nthat euer thei recouered in to what place thei in wente; and whan\nSadoyne saugh the myschef of his oncle and of his companye, he\ncried, \"Gentill knyghtes, now as armes, for now is the nede, ffor\nthis day we most recouer worship or all lese, and diffende oure\nlyves and oure heritages a-gein the enmyes of Ieshu criste, and\nwho that dieth in diffence of the cristin feith he shall be saued\nfrom the peyne of helle; ne neuer hadde we so moche nede to\nrecouer our honour as we haue now right; and se ther the kynge\nArthur, that is oure lorde terrien, be the baner of the dragon,\nthat is the beste knyght of the worlde, that us for to socoure put\nhym-self in a-uenture of deth, and whan he his body thus\na-bandoneth for us well ought we oures for to abandone for hym, and\ntherfore ought we haue grete pite of hym and of many other worthi\nmen that ben in his companye, for moche thei suffre and endure,\nand therfore ought we to haue grete drede whan thei ben thus\nrused and we that ben here-ynne so many shull helpe hem of nought,\nffor yet be we here-ynne of x Ml and moo, and se theym that passe\nnot foure hundre contene hem so vigerously that thei holde place\nbut haue all day suffred and endured the medle and the\nmartileys.

Whan the kynge leodogan approched the\nstanderd he and his men smot in so fiercely that thei made hem\ntremble, and than be-gan a newe stour, stronge and mortall, and\nther loste the sarazins many of here peple; and so moche vertu\nwas in leodogan and his men that thei made hem remove and\nforsake place; and with that com Sadoynes, hurlinge in so harde\na-monge hem that he drof hem euen ther the hoste hadde ben\nlogged, and ther thei stode stifly and merveillously hem deffended;\nand Merlin drough hym vp from the bataile, and made the\nknyghtes of the rounde table come a-boute hym, and made hem\nrefressh and girde hir horse and a-brethe hem, and to renewe\ntheire helmes and sheldes that hadde myster, and assembled\nto-geder alle hem that hadde ben in her warde, and thei were well\nrefresshed and a-vented and were well vij Ml , and eche man hadde\ntake a stronge spere; and whan thei hadde thus rested a-while\nthei saugh her meyne come full harde dryuinge, ffor the sarazins\nrecouered a-noon as the knyghtes of the rounde table lefte the\nstandard; and than Merlin criede, \"Gentill knyghtes, now vpon\nhem, and shewe youre knyghthode, ffor yef ye do well at this\nencountre a-noon thei shull go theire wey.\"  And than he seide\nto the kynge Arthur that euell he thought vpon that his wif\nhadde hym yoven, and that porely he hadde don in the firste\nstoure.  And whan Arthur that herde he wax rody for shame\nand seide no worde, and ficched sore in his stiropes.  And the\nkynge Ban be-gan to laugh vndir his helme, and shewde hym\nto the kynge Boors his brother, and alle the knyghtes of the\nrounde table; and thei preised hym moche, ffor thei saugh\nhym of fierce contenaunce, and seide yef he lyve longe ther\nwas neuer seyn soche a kynge; and thei preide god hym diffende\nfrom pereile. Whan Merlin approched the bataile he cried, \"Now vpon\nhem,\" and he drof in to the bataile with the dragon, that\nhe bar to the erthe alle that thei encountred, that thei lefte nought\nstandinge, so fierce was theire comynge; and Arthur, that helde\na stronge short spere, smote so the kynge Clarell that he perced\nshelde and hauberke, that he fill to grounde and hadde ne myster\nof no leche.  Than he ches to the kynge Rion by his coueringe\ncote that was full of berdes crowned, and whan Arthur hadde\nperceyved the kynge Rion, he plukked to hym his short spere,\nand preced thurgh the presse with his goode horse so that noon\nhym with-stode, but he caste to grounde xiiij, bothe horse and\nman, er he myght come to the kynge Rion, and than he smote\nhym so fiercely with this short spere thourgh shelde and\nhauberke, and hadde not ben the doublet that he hadde of a serpentes\nskyn, deed hadde he ben with-oute recouer; but the skyn was so\nharde that he myght not perce ne breke, neuertheles he shof so\nharde that he fill to grounde with his legges lifte vp-right. Whan the Geauntes and the sarazins saugh theire lorde\nfallen, thei fremysshed, for grete drede thei hadde leste\nhe were slayn, and alle thei ronne vpon Arthur and smote hym\nwith speres on all parties that thei bar hym to the erthe, his\nhorse and hym on a hepe to-geder.  And whan Merlin saugh\nthe kynge falle, he made hem renne to the rescu alle the vij Ml ,\nand than was ther soore medle and sharp shour, ffor that oon\npart peyned for to rescu, and that other part for to take or to\nconfounde for venguance of the kynge Rion.  But ther dide Ban\ngret merveilles, ffor he remounted Arthur a-monge his enmyes\nwith fin force, and made so grete lardre of the Geauntes, that\nnoon durste of hymn a-bide a stroke; and also diden well the vij Ml ,\nby the force of the knyghtes of the rounde table, that fewe ther\nwere but that he bar his felowe to the grounde, that thei made\nhem remove from the place magre hem alle.  Ther was the kynge\nRion foule diffouled er he myght a-gein be remounted.  But whan\nhe saugh that it turned to disconfuture, and that thei moste gon\nwolde thei or noon, he seide he hadde lever dye but his shame\nwere a-venged, and than he lepte on foote and caught his betill in bothe hondes and smote in to the presse, and be-gan to smyte\nsoche strokes on bothe sides, so rude and oute of mesure, that he\nconfounded all that he a-raught, that thei fledde from hym on\nalle partes for the merveilles that thei saugh hym do.  And on\nthat other side the kynge Ban and the kynge Arthur, and the\nkynge Boors, and Nascien, and Agragayns, and Vlfin, and hervy,\nand Antor, and kay the stiwarde, and lucas, and Gifflet, and the\nothere felowes, foughten so till thei come to the standerd of the\nkynge Rion that the Olyfauntes bar.  Ther was dolerouse fight,\nand the mortalito so grete, that ther ran stremes of blode as a\nrennynge river thourgh the felde.  Ther was throwe down the\nOlyfauntes and the standerd of the kynge Rion, and than a-roos\nthe shoute and the noyse vpon the Geuantes, that thei turned to\nflight toward the foreste.  And whan the Geuantes saugh that thei\nturned to disconfiture, and that the damage was theirs, thei ledde\nto kynge Rion his horse, and ledde hym a-wey wolde he or noon,\nfor grete drede thei hadde of hym, and he was so sorowfull, that\nnere he wente wode for Ire.  And er he departed, he dide grete\ndamage to kynge leodogan, ffor of his men he slough mo than xx\ner he departed oute of the felde; but whan he saugh thei fledde\nbothe oon and other that he myght no lenger a-bide, he wente his\nwey so wroth through the wode with-oute companye. Whan the kynge leodogan saugh the kynge Rion and the\nGeauntes fledden, he hem chaced, and Sadoynes, and\nCleodales, and Guyomar, that many thei lefte ligginge at erthe;\nand on that othir side the knyghtes of the rounde table made\nsoche lardure thourgh the felde as it hadde ben shepe strangeled\nwith wolves, ffor the plaisshes greved hem sore that thei myght\nnot passe delyuerly, ffor thei were so entassed with swerdes so\nthikke, that oon a-monge that other, and so affraide, that in hem\nwas litill diffence, and thei slough so many, that all the feldes\nwere covered with deed and wounded bodyes, and the chace dured\nvn-to derke nyght. Whan the kynge Rion departed fro the bateile so sory and\nwroth, as ye haue herde, and he was not a-perceyved of\nno man that hym knewe, saf only of kynge Arthur; and whan Arthur saugh hym departe so, he seide to hym-self, that rather\nwolde he be deed, than he sholde so ascape, and than he smote the\nhorse with the spores and lefte his felowes, so that noon wiste\nwhiche wey he wente.  And on that othir side the kynge Ban\npursude the kynge Glorienx, and Mynados, and Colufer: these\nthre kynges he chaced sooll by hym-self, thourgh the wode, and\nthe tother felowes were parted, her xx and here x, here xv, in\nsom place more than in a-nother, and so endured the chase of hem,\nthat in no wise wolde hem suffre to ascape till it was cler day,\nand be that tyme were so many slayn and diffouled, that of CC Ml that were at the begynnynge ne ascaped not xx Ml .  But now lete\nvs speke of the kynge Arthur that pursueth after the kynge Rion. So longe Arthur enchased the kynge Rion, that he hym\natteyned in a depe valey be-twene a litill wode and a medowe\nat a passage of a litill brooke that com rennynge of two welle\nsprynges of a mountayne, and the sonne was so lowe, that for the\nmounteynes and the wode hit was all derke, and ther ouer-toke\nArthur the kynge Rion, and than he cried, \"Turne the, coward\nGeaunte, or thow shalt dye fleynge, ffor thow seist well ther is\nno moo here but thow and I.\"  And whan the Geaunte\nvndirstode the kynge that so hym maneced, he helde ther-of grete\ndispite, ffor he saugh that he semed a-geyn hym but a\nchilde.  Than he returned toward hym with his betell in his honde, and\nput his targe hym be-forn that was of the bon of an Olyfaunte,\nand the kynge Arthur helde a shorte spere with a longe trenchaunt\nheede of sharp grounde steill, and ronne to-geder wroth and\nmaletalentif that oon a-gein that other, and that oon desiraunt of\npris and honour, and that other covetouse to a-venge hys shame\nand his harme.  The kynge Arthur com faste, for he was meved\nfrom fer, and Rion hym a-bode with his betill in his honde, and\nArthur hym smote so sore with this spere thourgh the shelde,\nthough it were neuer so harde, that the stiell passed through two\nplites of the hauberke on the lifte side, that the blode lepe oute\ngrete foyson that all the shafte was couered in blode; but for no\nmyght that he cowde shove, myght he not make hym to remeve\nhis sadill, and the spere splyndered in peces.  And whan the Geaunte felte hym-selfe wounded, he gnasshed his teth and rolled\nhis iyen, that were grete swollen for ire and mantelent that he\nhadde, and he lifte vp his betill of brasse as he that was\nmerveilouse grete and stronge a-bove alle tho that eny man knewe in\ntho dayes, and as the boke seith, he was xiiij foote of lengthe,\nand half a palme be-twene his browes, and was grete and lene\nand full of veynes and of senewes, and was also so grym a figure\nthat he was dredefull for to be-holde. Whan Arthur saugh the Geaunte lifte vp his malle he douted\nthe stroke, and ran to hym so rudely with the body of\nhis horse that he bar to the erthe bothe Rion and his horse; but\nsoone was he vpon his foote, but first was Arthur garnysshed of\nhis armes er the Geaunt were reised, for Arthur was also fallen to\ngrounde with the frayinge that thei hurteled to-geder.  And\nArthur was wight and lifly, and yet hadde he not but xx yere of\nage, and the kynge Rion hadde moo than xlij largely, and was\ngrete and hevy by the thirde part more than he; and as soone as\nthei were vp, thei ronne ther to-geder, and Arthur griped\nCalibourne, his goode swerde that he pulde oute of the ston,\nwher-with that day he hadde yove many a stroke; and as soone as he\nhadde it drawen oute, hit yaf so grete light as it hadde ben a grete\nbronde of fire, and couered hym with his shelde, and raught a\nstroke to the Geaunte er he were couered vpon the heede, and\nwhan he saugh the stroke comynge he caste the shelde ther a-gein,\nfor sore he dredde the stroke of the swerde that he saugh so\nbright shynynge, ffor he knewe it was of right grete bounte; and\nthe kynge Arthur smote so in the malle that he helde be-fore hym\nin bothe hondes that he kutte the helue a-sonder faste by the\nhede, and yet was it bounde with Iren; the stroke was grete and\nrudely smyten, and discended vpon the corner of his shelde, that\nhe slitte it to the bokill, and with the plukkynge of his swerde\na-gein to hym he made the kynge Rion for to stomble, that was\nsory for his brasen malle that he hadde so loste, and than he leide\nhonde to his swerde, that was oon of the beste of the worlde, ffor,\nas the booke seith, it was som tyme Hercules that ledde Iason\nin to the Ile of Colchos, for to fecche the flees of goolde, and with that swerde dide hercules sle many a Geaunte in that londe,\nwhere Iason ledde Medea that so moche hym loved, but after he\nhir failled, where as hercules hir dide helpe by his grete debonertee,\nand the booke seith that Vlcan I-forged that swerde in the tyme\nof Adrastus, the kynge of Greece, that many a day hadde in his\ntresour.  This same swerde hadde Tideus, the sone of the Duke\nof Calcedoyne, that day that he dide the message to Ethiocles\nfor Polemyte, and in his comynge homwarde with the same\nswerde he slowgh fifty at an hill, and after wente this swerde fro\nhande to hande and from heir to heir, that now hath it the kynge\nRion, that com of the lynage of hercules, that was so noble and\nhardy. Whan the kynge Rion saugh his malle smyten a-sonder, he\ndrough this swerde that was of so grete bountee, and as\nsoone as it was oute of the skawberke it caste so grete claretee\nthat it semed a flame of fire; and the name of this swerde was\nMarmyadoise.  And whan Arthur saugh the swerde that so flambed\nhe preised it moche in his herte, and drough hym a litill vp hit\nto be-holde, and coueyted it right sore, and thought that in goode\nhoure were he born that it myght conquere.  And whan the\nkynge Rion saugh hym stonde so stille, he with-stode and hym\na-resoned, as ye shull here.  \"Sir knyght,\" qoud he, \"I wote\nneuer what thow art, but thow haste do grete hardynesse that\nme durste sue or chace a-lone with-oute companye, and for the\nprowesse that I se in the I shall do the grete curtesie that I dide\nneuer to no man: yeve me that swerde and thyn armes, and telle\nme thy name, and after thow shalt go quyte, ffor I haue grete\npite fer to sle the for that thow semest so yonge.\"  Whan Arthur\nvndirstode the wordes of the kynge Rion he hadde ther-of grete\ndispite, and ansuerde hym felly, \"How wenest to take me so\nlightly, that I sholde yelde me recreaunt for that thow art so\ngrete and so stronge.  But ley down that swerde and tho armes,\nand putte the in my mercy, to do with the my plesier outerly, for\nI the assure but the deth.\"  At these wordes lowgh the Geaunte,\nand turned the heede in trauerse, and asked hym what he was,\nand what was his name, and coniured hym by his creaunce to sey the trouthe.  And Arthur seide he wolde telle hym by\ncouenaunt that he wolde telle hym what he were, and he hym\ngraunted.  \"Now knowe thow well,\" qoud he, \"that my name is\nArthur, of Bretaigne, the sone of Vterpendragan, that am come\nto chalenge this reame that is myn all quyte, ffor the kynge\nleodogan hath yove me hys doughter to my wif, and me haue\ndon homage alle the high barouns of this reame, and also he\nhymself.  Now telle me what thow art, and what is thy name, ffor\nI haue tolde the the trouthe of myn.\"  Quod the Geaunte,\n\"Seist thou trouthe that thow art Arthur, the sone of\nVterpendragon, that slough Aungis be-fore the roche of saisnes.\"  \"Of\nthe same speke I with-oute faile,\" qoud Arthur.  \"I haue made\ncouenaunt,\" quod the Geaunte, \"that I shall telle the myn\nname.  I do the to wite that I am the kynge Rion, of Iselonde, and of\nalle the londes vn-to pastures, and yet ferther yef a man myght\nferther passe; but oon may neuer passe till that the lawes be\nbroken that Iudas makabeus ther sette, and as olde auncient seyn\nthat thei shall neuer be hadde a-wey till the a-uentures be-gynne\nin the reame of logres of the seynt Graall, and it be-hoveth hym\nto caste to the portes of the goulfe of Sathanye that it be neuer\nseyn after, ffor it is so of soche maner, that so it moste be\nfallen.  Now I haue tolde the what I am.  But I will neuer ete while I\nknowe the on lyve, ffor by the it is that I am thus disconfited\nand chased from the felde, and ther-fore shall I a-venge my dooll\nyef I may.\"  \"So helpe me god,\" quod Arthur, \"than shalt thow\nlonge be fastinge, ffor that shall neuer falle that I shall be deed\nthourgh the; and lo! here my swerde that the deffieth to the\ndeth, and yef thow be so hardy, take now the vengaunce of hym\nthat the diffieth to smyte of thyn heede.\"  And whan the Geaunte\nherde Arthur thus speke, he was so wroth that nygh he yede oute\nof his witte, and griped his shelde and com with his swerde in\nhis honde and lifte it high to smyte Arthur on the helme, but he\ncaste the shelde ther a-gein and lepte a-side in the felde, and he\nsmote so harde that a quarter fill to the erthe, and Arthur stepped\nforth and yaf hym soche a stroke by the lifte yie and made hym\na grete wounde, and yef the swerde hadde not swarued, maymed hadde he ben for euer.  Whan the Geaunte felt hym wounded\nand saugh the blode raile down by the lifte iye, he was nygh wode\noute of witte, and than he ran vpon hym, for he wende to take\nhym in his armes, but Arthur dide lepe a-side, for a-bide that\nwolde he not, and ther-with raught hym a grete stroke, and euer\nhe hym pursued with swerde in honde, but atteyne hym myght\nhe not.  And while thei demened hem in this manere, fill so that\nNascien, and Adragains, and hervy de rivell com vpon hem, that\nchaced vj sarazins full fiercely, and alle vj were kynges, and that\noon hight Cahainus, and that other maltaillees, and the thirde\nffernicans, and the forth heroars, and the v e Brauremes, and the\nsexthe the stronge kynge Mahidrap.  These vj kynges com down\nthe rocher sore hem diffendinge, and the swyfte horse com dryuynge\nlike a tempest.  And whan the tweyne that foughten herde this\nnoyse and brunt of hem that fledden, and be-helde and saugh the\nvj kynges that the thre knyghtes chaced, the kynge Rion was\nsore a-dredde, for he knewe tho that ther com, ffor he wiste\nwell thei were noble and hardy, and yef he lenger ther a-bide he\nknewe well that dye he moste.  Than he com to his horse and\nlept vp lightly, and in the lepinge vp Arthur hym smote so harde\nthat he kutte a-wey a quarter of his helme that the mailes of the\nhauberke a-pered all white, and a-stoned hym sore that he bowed\non his horse nekke, and yef he myght haue recovered a-nother\nstroke he hadde fallen of his horse to the erthe; but the horse\nwas of grete force and a-ferde of the stroke, and turned to flight\nwith the kynge down the roche. Than Arthur lept vpon his horse delyuerly and priked after\nall that he myght, and than the kynge Rion loked bakke\nand saugh Arthur that dide hym enchace sore that wolde not\nhym leve, and hasted hym faste towarde the foreste, and the vj\nkynges, that the thre knyghtes so chaced, com so faste fleynge that\nthei ouer-toke the kynge Arthur that kepte the Geaunte so shorte,\nthat he hadde caste his shelde to cover his hede, for soore he\ndredde the goode swerde of Arthur; and while Arthur entended to the Geaunte, Kehenyns hym a-scride, and seide, \"Turne the,\nin euell tyme haste thow hym pursued, for I will hym\nchalenge.  In sory tyme haste thow lefte thy felowes.\"  Whan Arthur herde\nhym so lowde hym a-scrye, he returned with his swerde in his\nhonde, and ther while the kynge Rion fledde in to the\nforeste.  And Arthur com to kehenyns, and he agein hym that nothinge\nhym ne douted, and smote to-geder with swerdes full harde vpon\nhelmes.  And kehenyns smote Arthur vpon the helme that he\nmade hym stoupe vpon his horse nekke, and Arthur smote so hym\nagein, that of his helme he kutte a quarter, the stroke was grete,\nand descended be-twene the shelde and the shuldre and kutte of\nhis lifte arme with all the shelde; and Kehenyns ran vpon hym\nto enbrace hym in the tother arme, for he was of grete\nstrengthe.  Whan Arthur saugh hym come he smote hym with his swerde\nbe-twene the honde and the elbowe, that the honde fill of with\nthe swerde; and whan he saugh hym-self so maymed, he cried\nand brayed as a bole, and the horse hym bar what wey he\nwolde.  And whan the tother v saugh that kehenyns was so araide, hem\nfor-thought it sore, and ronne vpon Arthur, and he hym couered\nwith his shelde, as he that daigned not hem for to fle.  And thei\nsmote at hym vp and down, where thei wende hym moste a-peire,\nand thei to-hewe his shelde in many places, but thei hurte of\nhym no flessh.  And he smote so ffernycans, that he slitte hym\nto the teth, and than he smote to heroars vpon the shelde that\nhe fill to grounde; and than com the thre knyghtes, Nascien, and\nAdrageins, and hervy; and than the thre kynges turned to flight\nafter the steppes of the horse of kynge Rion where as thei hadde\nseyn hym go, and these after that so wolde hem leven.  But now\nspeke we of the kynge Ban that chaced the kynges. So longe enchaced the kynge Ban after the thre kynges that\nhe ouer-toke hem in a launde of a foreste, where thei stode\nstifly, for ther thei ouertoke x of her felowes, that ronne vpon\nthe kynge Ban as soone as thei hym saugh, and he smote so the\nfirste that he mette, that he clefte the heede in two peces, and than\nhe smote a-nother that the shulder disseuered from the body, and\nthan thridde that the heede fill in to the felde, and thei hym smyten vpon the helme and the shelde, but thei touched of hym\nno flesshe, ffor the hauberke was of grete strenghthe, and as thei\nthus foughten com Pignoras, and Sonygrex, and Gaisdon, and\nmagoras, that the kynge Boors hadde enchaced full harde, and\nhem kepte so straite, that thei hadde no leyser hem to returne;\nand so haue thei fledde till thei fill vpon hem that the kynge\nBan delyuered grete bataile; and than thei turned the heedes of\ntheire horse towarde hym that hem pursuwed, and he smote\na-monge hem with so grete force that he bar down Pignoras,\nbothe hym and his horse, on oon hepe; and than he smote to\nSinagrex so harde that he clefe hym to the brayn, and he fill\ndeed.  And than be-helde the kynge Boors, and saugh his brother that\nfaught a-gein x knyghtes, and he spored his horse so sore that\nhe bar a Sarazin to grounde hym and his horse, and than he\nsmote a-nother with his swerde that he fill deed, and the thre\nkynges that he hadde chaced ronne vpon hym, and smote hym\nvpon the helme be-hynde, that he stouped on his horse nekke,\nbut to arise was it no tyme, but he turned his horse hede a-gein\nhem, with his swerde in his hande, and ther be-gan the two\nbretheren a sore medle and crewell a-gein the xiij that hem\nassailleden, but more thei hem damaged than thei dide hem;\nbut longe hadde thei not ben ther, whan the kynge Rion com\nthider with the swerde drawen, sore hurte and euell affraide, and sore\nbledynge of two woundes, that oon on the heede and that other on\nthe lifte side in the flanke, and whan he saugh the bataile of xiij\nknyghtes a-gein tweyne, he dressed hym that wey with his swerde,\nfor fayn wolde he a-venge his anoye, and he smote at hem so\nfiercely, that he made hem remeve the place fro ther thei stoden,\nand by his comynge was the kynge Boors born to grounde, and his\nhorse vpon his body; and than he lifte vp his swerde for to smyte\nthe kynge Ban vpon the helme, but he couered hym with his\nshelde and smote the horse with the spores to eschewe the stroke,\nand he slytte the shelde as fer as the he raught, and the kynge Ban\nsente hym a stroke with corsheuse, his good swerde, and he caste\nhis shelde ther a-geins, and the kynge Ban clefte it thourgh-oute,\nand the gige also, wherby it henge by his nekke, and it fill in two partes to the erthe.  And on that othir side, as soone as the\nSarazins saugh the kynge Boors fallen, thei ronne vpon hym, and\nyaf hym grete strokes at the erthe, and hurte hym in dyuerse\nplaces; and the horse, that was myghty and stronge, lay vpon\nhis lifte thigh, and hilde hym so straite to the erthe, that a-rise\nmyght he not; and whan the kynge Ban saugh his brother in\nsoche pereile, he praide god hym to saue fro mysauenture, for of\nhym hadde he grete drede.  Than he spored his horse that wey\nand smote the kynge Magoras, so that the heede fill to grounde,\nand after he smote a-nother so felly, that the chyne yede a-sonder,\nand than he a-bode vpon his brother that moche hym peyned to\narise.  And as thei thus foughten Com fleynge maltaillyet, and\nbalfinne, and the kynge Mahidrap full faste, ffor ther com thre\nknyghtes that hem chaced with grete spede, wher-of that on was\nthe kynge Arthur, and that other Nascien, and Adragayns li\nbruns, the brother of Madagot, the goode knyght of the blake yle\ntournoye, that Gawein, the nevew of kynge Arthur, after toke at\nEstremors, whan that he kepte in prison his cosin Galashin, that\nday that he wolde hym haue hanged vpon the walles of the\ntown, in despite of kynge Arthur, be-fore his owne iyen, ffor that\nhe hadde sege be-fore town that he wolde haue take be strength,\nand for that the kynge hadde slain oon of his nevewes at a\npoynt, that hadde be by-fore the town, as this boke shall tell yow\nmore clerly here-after, whan the mater cometh ther-to.  The\nfourthe felowe that com after with these thre knyghtes was\nhervy de rivell, the banerer of the rounde table, and as soone as\nthese thre com ther as the kynge Rion faught hym-self, x a-gein a\nsooll knyght, thei dressed hem to the presse and greved hem all\nthat thei myght.  And the kynge Boors hadde so drawen and\npulled as he that was of grete strengthe, that he a-roos with grete\npeyne, and saugh his brother in grete toyle that vigerousely hym\ndiffended, and than he smote maltailliet that he disseuered the\nshulder from the side and he fill deed to the erthe, and he hente\nthe horse that was of grete bounte and lept in to the sadill, and\na-noon rode in to the presse, and smote so sore the kynge Rion\nvpon the helme, that he slitte it in two partes, and he hym paide a-gein so grete a stroke that his shelde clef a-sonder,\nand ther be-gan a medle be-twene hem two full fell and crewell;\nand the tother foure that were come to socour the kynge Ban\nsmote on hem so rudely that ech bar oon deed to the erthe all\nblody.  Ther was slayin mahidrap, and balfinnes, and Gloriex,\nand mandones, where-fore the kynge Rion was full wroth, for thei\nwere his nygh kyn.  And whan kynge Rion saugh this\nmyschaunce turne vpon hym so grete, he was so wroth that nygh he\nwas oute of his witte, and he helde his swerde naked and ran\nvpon Arthur and wende to smythe hym on the heede, but he\nglenched a-side, for sore he dredde the stroke of the Geaunte, and\nhe smote so harde in the shelde that he slitte it in to the myddell,\nand whan that he wende to pulle a-gein his swerde the kynge\nArthur smote hym on the arme that sore he hym hurte, and he\nlefte the swerde stykinge in the shelde, that sore felt hym hurte,\nand was wode for wrath, and Arthur caste down the shelde with\nthe swerde, for it dide hym but gref.  And when the Geaunte\nsaugh that he hadde so loste his swerde he was full of grete\nsorowe, and ran vpon Arthur with his horse and caught hym by\nthe shuldres, and wolde haue hym born with force, and so he\nsholde haue don yef he hadde leiser, for he was of grete strengthe. Whan Arthur felte the Geaunte that so hym helde he caste\nthe swerde to the erthe, for he was ferde leste he sholde\nhaue taken it from hym by force, and than clippid his horse in\nbothe his armes a-boute the nekke; and the Geaunte pulled and\ndrough, but he myght hym not a-race from the sadell.  And the\nkynge Ban be-helde and saugh the strife be-twene the Geaunte\nand Arthur, and a-noon spored his horse that wey, for he hadde\nof hym grete drede; and the Geaunte saugh hym come, he lefte\nArthur, for sore he douted the kynge Ban, and ran vpon hym\nwith his handes that were grete and square; and the kynge Ban\nhym smote with corsheuse, his goode swerde, that he rente his\nhauberke be-twene his sholderes and wounde hym right depe;\nand whan the kynge Rion felt hym so sore wounded, and saugh\nhis felowes ly at erthe deed bledynge, he hadde grete drede, ffor\nhe hadde nothinge hym to diffende, and turned the horse, that was of grete bounte, and wente fleynge as faste as he myght\nrenne.  And thei lete hym passe, for it was nyght; and he wente\nso wroth that for litill he hadde gon oute of witte; and he cursed\nhis feith and his creaunce, and seide he wolde neuer cesse in all\nhis age till that he were a-venged, and as soone as he com in to his\ncontre he wolde sende for his grete hoste so that no londe sholde\na-gein hym endure till he hadde confounded all Bretaigne and all\nthe peple ther-ynne, and take the kynge Arthur and his helpers,\nand do hem be flayn all quyk.  Thus wente kynge Rion, makynge\ngrete sorowe and weymentacion in to his contrey. Whan the kynge Ban socoured the kynge Arthur from the\nkynge Rion, that so wolde a-born hym a-wey, he com\nto Arthur and asked hym yef he hadde eny harme.  And he\nseide, \"Nay.\"  Than seide Ban, \"Where is youre\nswerde?\"  And Arthur seide it was at erthe, \"ffor I caste it down as soone as\nthe shrewe com rennynge on me to gripe me in his armes; and I\nhaue wonne the richest iewell, and that I love more than the\nrichest Citee that I haue.\"  \"What thinge is that?\" seide the\nkynge Ban.  \"That shall ye se a-noon,\" quod Arthur.  Than he\nsette foot to grounde, and yede firste to Calibourne and putte it\nin the skaberke whan he hadde dried it clene, and than com to\nhis shelde, where-ynne stake the swerde of kynge Rion, and he\ndrough it oute and toke the shelde, and com to his horse and\nlepte vp, and than shewde the swerde to the kynge Ban, and it\nshone so bright that Arthur hadde ther-of grete ioye, and preide\ngod sende hym som a-uenture ther he myght it assay and prove\nyef it were so grete of bounte as it hadde bewtee.  And thei\nwere ner the Citee than thei wende, but er thei com ther hem\nfill soche a-uenture that ther was noon so wight ne hardy but he\nhadde I-nough to done.  But now resteth a litell of hem, and\nspeke of the kynge leodogan. Whan the kynge leodogan saugh that the Geauntes were so\ndiscounfited, he chaced hem full vigerously till it was\nderke nyght; and he and his men slough many.  Than fill it\nthat the kynge leodogan and Cleodalis his stiwarde departed from\ntheire peple, for the foreste was derke, that no man that thei hadden wiste not where thei were be-come; and whan the kynges\nmen saugh it was so derke nyght they be-gonne to returne; but\nthe knyghtes of the rounde table wolde not returne, ne the\nfelowes of kynge Arthur, but chace the Geauntes full harde, and\nmany of hem thei slowen; and the storye seith that the kynge\nleodogan and Cleodalis chaced so faste Ydras and Atalas\nlamnachour and Caulus and Dorilas, these were fer from her peple in the\nforest; and whan thei hadde longe fledde, thei ouer-toke xij Ml of\nher companye at were sory and wroth for theire losse and damage,\nand whan these foure saugh the socour, thei cried, \"Now at hem,\"\nand whan these be-helden and saugh thei were but tweyne that\nchaced foure kynges, thei ronne vpon hem full fiercely, and thei\ndrough hem to two okes that were grete and full of leves, and\nther-to thei sette here bakkes.  Ther was the kynge leodogan at\nerthe and hys horse slayn vndir hym; and whan Cleodalis saugh\nhym on foote he alight and sette the kinge on his horse, and bad\nhym gon hys wey and he wolde a-bide ther.  And whan the kynge\nsaugh the trouthe of his stiwarde, he be-gan to sighen full sore\nvndir his helme and repente in his herte of that he hadde hym sore\nforfeted, and thought in his herte that this bounte wolde he hym\nquyte yef he scape a-lyve, and alwey thei hem deffenden a-gein\nher enmyes that hem assailed full harde, but the Oke hem socoured\nsore that was at theire bakke.  But a-while resteth of hem and\nspeketh of Guyomar and Synados, that were cosins germain, that\nwele hadde don all the day in bataile. This Guyomar and Synados pursude so the sarazins thourgh\nthe foreste, that thei loste alle her peple, that thei cowde\nof hem neyther here ne seen, and hadden so chaced xij Geauntes\nfull harde, and the xij hadde longe fledde, till thei mette   . of\ntheire felowes that wente sore affraide, and these ne wiste of hem\nnothinge till thei were euen fallen vpon hem, and than these com\nso sharply that ech of hem bar oon to grounde; and whan the\nsarazins saugh thei were but tweyne, thei drough theire swerdes\nand assailed hem right harde.  And thei hem diffended full\nvigerously, ffor thei were full noble knyghtes and hardy; and a-noon\nther com to hem a-nother knyght, that was cleped ydiers, and whan he was come he knewe hem a-noon and helped hem\nvigerously.  But of hem also resteth a-while the tale, and telleth of\nthe auenture that fill to Antor, that hadde norisshed Arthur, and\nto kay the stiwarde, and Gifflet, and lucas the botiller, and to\nmarengis, and Gorgain his felowe, and to Blecys the blake, that\nwas in theire companye, and to Blioberis, and Galescowde, and to\nlait hardy, and Colegreuaunt, and kehedin le bel: these xij\nchaced faste the sarazins, and many thei slough, thourgh the\nforeste. So longe chaced these xij thourgh the foreste, that was derke\nfor shadowe of the bowes, and also of the nyght, that\nsodeynly thei fill vpon the kynge Ali patin, that hadde CC sarazins\nin his companye wele horsed, that were full angry for the damage\nof the kynge Rion, and for that thei wiste not where thei were\nbe-come; and whan these xij hadde hem so sodeynly ouertaken,\nthei rode in a-monge hem fercely, and thei returned and be-gonne\na bataile right stronge, ffor these xij were full worthi knyghtes\nand noble.  Ther was stronge fight and harde, that dured till\nmydnyght was paste er thei departed, and on that other side the\nknyghtes of the rounde table were departed in thre partees: in\nthat oon part were xij, in a-nother xx, and in that other\nxxv; and with the kynge Arthur were thre, that ledde hym\ntowarde Toraise, in talmelide, and alle the tother weren returned\nwhan thei hadde hem a-while conveyed.  And whan thei come\nbe-fore the Citee of Danablise, and eueriche ne fonde not his\ncompanye, thei trowed that thei were alle deed; and whan the\ntwo kynges were not founden, the kynge Arthur ne the kynge\nleodogan, thei made grete sorowe, and wende thei hadde ben alle\ndeed; but yet thei a-boode to heere som tidinges, and logged\nhem in the medowes, and wolde not entre in to the town, but\nwacched till it was day.  Here leveth now of hem and speketh\nof Merlin. Now, whan the Geauntes and the sarazins fledde oute of the\nfeilde discounfited and the chace was be-gonne, the booke\nseith that Merlin sewed a companye that were well x Ml , till thei\nfill in to a launde that was depe in the foreste.  This companye ledde the kynge Galad, that was lorde of the londe cleped\nPastures, and as soone as thei were entred in to this launde, Merlin\ncaste an enchauntement, that he made seme ther com rennynge\nso grete a water in her wey be-fore hem, that was so depe and\nbrode and ther-to blakke, that com down fro the sides of the\nmounteynes so rudely, that ther was noon so hardy but he ther-of\nhadde drede; and whan thei wolde haue turned a-gein, thei saugh\na-rise soche a storme and a wynde so grete, that thei wiste not\nwhiche wey to turne, and a-boode stille all nyght in this maner\nwise, that thei wente nother bakke ne forewarde; and why Merlin\nmade this enchauntement hit is right and reson that the trouthe\nbe declared whi was the cause. This was the trouthe, that in the marche of Tamelide and of\nBredigan west-warde towarde the londe of the kynge Rion\nwas a reame full riche, that the kynge Amant helde in his\nbaile.  In this reame werred the kynge Vterpendragon in his lif-tyme\nlonge, ffor that the kynge Amaunt wolde not be-come his liege\nman, and his londe was so stronge that litill he hym douted; but\nVterpendragon greved hym sore with his werre, and conquered\nvpon hym a Castell that was stronge and riche, and was clepede\nCarroie.  This Castell hadde in fee v C knyghtes, that eche yere\nthre monethes oughten ther to warde, whiche seison of the yere\nthat the lorde wolde hem somowne, and the lordship lasted xx\nmyle on euery side.  This Castell yaf Vterpendragon to the kynge\nBoors of Gannes in his lyve to hym and to his heires all the lordship,\nand as soone as the kynge Bohors hadde it in his baille, he yaf it\nto Guynebant, his brother, that was a goode clerke and a wise,\nand at armes wight and hardy yef nede were, and therfore was\nthe kynge Amaunt angry; and whan he herde that the kynge\nRion was entred in to the londe of kynge leodogan, and on that\nother side in to Bretaigne were entred the Saisnes, the kynge\nAmaunt be-thought hym that he myght come neuer in better\npoynt to conquere his Castell that he so longe hadde loste, and\nsente after peple and assembled vij Ml , and rode forth till he\ncom in to the launde ther as was the kynge Galad, and hys peple\nthat were x Ml , that a-bode ther for drede of the grete water that Merlin made to apere.  The friday erly in the witsonwike, that\nwas a feire morownynge and a softe, and yet was not the water\nne the enchauntement lefte, the sarazins lepte to horse and rode\nforth her wey, but thei hadde but litill wey riden, whan thei\nmette the kynge Amaunt, that rode towarde the Castell of Carroye\nwith all his hoste.  Whan the kynge Galad saugh the kynge\nAmaunt he ran vpon hym, for he wende that it hadde be the peple\nof kynge leodogan that hadde hem pursued; and thei were well\nhorsed on bothe partyes, and smyten to-geder fiercely, and be-gan\na grete bataille and fell, for ther were many goode knyghtes and\nsure, and the bataile be-twene hem dured all the day.  But more\nof hem speketh not the booke at this tyme, but returneth to kynge\nArthur and kynge leodogan, and his felowes Nascien, and\nAdragain, and hervy de rivell. Whan Arthur hadde take vp the swerde that was lefte in\nhis shelde and hadde shewed to his felowes thei were\ngladde, for moche thei hym preised and comended, and than thei\ntoke theire wey towarde Danablaise.  And whan thei wende haue\nben in the streight lane, thei wente oute of her weye, for thei\nfonde on the lifte side an olde wey that was moche and grene,\nand grete shadowe of grete wode full of leves, as in the moneth\nof may, and a litill was it derke, for the mone was not vp, that\nwas at fulle thre dayes be-fore; and whan thei hadde gon a-while,\nthei herkened and herde grete noyse of strokes in the foreste of a\nbataile, and thei drough that wey as the lane hem ledde, and as\nthei com nygh, thei vndirstode the voise of theire peple that yet\nwere fightinge with the Geauntes, that thei hadde chaced in the\nforeste.  Than thei drough towarde the noise that thei herde, and\nlefte her wey and gan ride faste, and the mone was risinge, and\nas thei com nygh thei saugh a grete bataile of thre knyghtes, that\nfull harde foughten agein   . sarazins.  And whan thei com so\nnygh that thei myght hem kenne, Arthur knewe it was Guyomar\nand ydier, but of Synados wiste noon of hem what he was, saf that\nthei saugh he was wight and hardy; and hem preised moche the\nvij felowes, that com nygh to the bataile, and lete renne theire\nhorse so faste, that thei made hem alle to fremysshe, and leide on grete strokes on bothe sides, and many thei sloughen and some\ncaste to grounde wounded sore, and Arthur assaied right well his\nswerde Marmyadoise, that he conquered of the kynge Rion, ffor\nthe storie witnesseth that he his owne body slough of hem\nx.  And whan the thre knyghtes saught that thei hadde so riche\nsocour, thei yaf hem a fressh assaute, and eche of hem thre bar\noon to the grounde, and in short tyme thei hurlled hem so, thei\nand the thre knyghtes that were com hem to socoure, that thei\nhaue alle slain saf v, that turned to flight down the wode, and\nthei after that were full talentif hem to sle, yef thei myght hem\ntake; but litill while hadde thei chaced these v, whan thei herde\nmedlinge, and harde strokes vpon sheldes, and vpon helmes, that\nall the wode ther-of resounded.  Than spake the kynge Ban to\nthe kynge Bohors, and seide that all nyght be-houeth hem to\ndisporte in bateillinge, and the kynge Arthur seide, \"That pleseth\nme well till that I haue well assaide my goode swerde.\" \"How, sir,\" quod the kynge Ban, haue ye not yet well it\nproved and assaied at thys firste enuaie?\" \"No,\" quod\nArthur, \"for thei were to fewe peple, and on that othir side ye\nand other so hem so arayed that I myght it not assaye at my\nvolunte.\"  Than at this wordes loughen alle the knyghtes, ffor\nwell hadde thei seyen his prowesse that he hadde don, and seide\nthat he sholde be a noble knyght yef he myght live to age.  And\nas thei spake thus, thei approched the bataile that was grete and\nfelenouse, and than thei saugh C sarazins that fought a-gein xij\nknyghtes, where-of foure of hem were on foote, and viij on horse,\nthat right well hem deffended, and thei that were on foote\ndeffended hem right well and stronglich, and than thei knewe\nwell, that thei were of her companye, that com with hem to\nTamelide alle xij.  And the foure that were on foote, that oon\nwas Antor, and that other Gosnain, and the thridde Gales, and the\nfourthe Blioberis, and the fifte ly lais \u00fee hardy, that was smyten\ndown in sight of hem alle, but vigerously thei hem\ndeffended.  And whan Arthur saugh Antor on foote hit nedeth not to aske, yef\nhe ther-fore were angry, for he shewed it well in grete haste, ffor\nhe priked in to the presse with swerde redy drawen, and smote so the firste that he mette that he slitte hym to the girdill, and\nafter the secunde that the hede fill to grounde, and than the\nthirde, and after the fourthe, and be-gan soche assaute a-monge\nhem that down wente all that he with his swerde raught.  And\nthan he preised well the goode swerde that was the kynge Rion,\nand seide that Calibourne ne a-vailed but litill a-gein this goode\nswerde, ffor it wrought well at his talent.  And also his felowes\nsmote in a-monge hem, that eche of hem slough oon at her\ncomynge in; and whan these saugh thei hadde soche socour, thei\nbe-gonne newe a-gein the bataile merveilous.  Ther was the\nstronge stour and sore bataile, ffor noble and hardy were the\nknyghtes that were come to the socour, and by theire prowesses\nwere the fyve knyghtes horsed that were on foote, and than thei\nyaf hem a sharpe shour that thei were disconfited and chaced oute\nof the place, and haue hem so araied, that there ne scaped but\nxiiij that alle ne were slayn and maymed.  And whan thei hadde\nhem a-while enchased, than thei returned a-gein full gladde and\nioyfull of the a-uenture that god hadde hem sente. At the end of this paragraph in the MS. are the following words\u2014\"sente withe swerde redy drawne,\" added in a later hand. Whan Arthur and his felowes hadde holpen and delyuered\nthe xij knyhtes, as ye haue herde, and thei were\nreturned a-gein, hit fill that thei mette Merlin with the Dragon in\nhis hande that com hem a-geins, and as soone as he saugh hem\ncomynge he gan to whowpe, \"A here, Arthur, ride faste and\nhaste yow a litill more and alle youre companye, ffor ye knowe\nnot the grete damage that is towarde, but god helpe, ffor the\nkynge leodogan and Cleodalis the stiwarde fighten a-gein moo than\nvij Ml Geauntes and sarazins, and thei be now smyten down of\ntheire horse, and shull a-noon be loste but ye hem socour.  Now\ncome on faste after me, for I go.\"  And whan thei herde what\nMerlin seide thei smote theire horse with spores, and the dragon\nthat Merlin bar yaf oute of his throte soche light that thei myght\nwell se alle here felowes though it hadde be the derkeste nyght\nin all the yere, and thei rode so faste be-fore and after, that thei\ncome to tweyne Okes wher vndir the two knyghtes foughten full sore, as thei that hadde I-nough of herte and of valour and\nforce.  But sore were thei oppressed, ffor bothe were thei on foote, and\nofte fill thei on knees.  When Merlin and the other companye\ncome to the medle that so hadden dured of the two knyghtes, tho\nwas the kynge leodogan fallen to the erthe, ffor he was so wery\nfor trauaile of strokes that he hadde yoven and receyved, that he\nmyght no lengere sustene, for all day hadde the kynge endured\ntraueile of strokes, and ther-to hadde he no myster, ffor he was\nof grete age. Whan the Geauntes saugh the kynge leodogan so wery that\nhe myght no lenger sustene on his feet for the traueile\nthat he hadde all the day endured in the bataile, so that he lay at\nthe erthe, and ther was no man that hadde seyn hym in that\nplite but he wolde haue hadde pite.  Whan the kynge was fallen,\nthe Geauntes spored theire horse that wey who that myght\nsonneste that noon a-bode other, ffor thei wende a-noon hym to\ntake or to sle at hir wille; but Cleodalis strode ouer hym with\nhis swerde in his hande that so well hym diffended that noon was\nso hardy to sette on hym hande; and thei hym assailed full\nharde, and launched at hym speres and swerdes, and perced his\nhauberke in many places, and wounded hym full sore; but for\nnoon hurte ne wounde that thei hym made wolde he not forsake\nhis lorde.  And at laste the kynge a-roos, and gan to helpe\nCleodalis with all his power, for he hadde ben a noble knyght in\nhis yowthe, and he hadde grete pite of hys stiward Cleodalis,\nthat so a-bandoned his body for the diffence of hym; and than\nhe seide a pitouse worde, \"Ha! Cleodalis,\" qoud he, \"I crye\nthe mercy of the trespace that I haue don a-gein the, ffor I se\nwell I am come to myn ende;\" and ther-with he fill on kne to\nthe grounde be-fore hym, and toke his swerde wepinge as he that\nto hym hadde forfeted, and praied to hym take of hym that was\nright.  And whan he saugh his lorde so meke a-gein hym, and\nthat he putte hym in his mercy, he wept tendirly and reised the\nkynge be the hande and claymed hym quyte of alle trespaces;\nand while he lifte vp the kynge a grete Geaunte smote Cleodalis\nwith a swerde vpon the helme that he bar hym down to the grounde, and than the kynge hym diffended sore and merveillously\nwell from them that wolde hym haue take; and thei hym assailed\nharde and hurte hym that he gretly a-peired, but soone thei made\nhym to falle down by Cleodalis; and whan Cleodalis saugh hym\ndown he lept vp on foote as lifly as he hadde noon harme ne\ndissese, and yet was he full dispitously wounded. Thus diffended the ton the tother whan thei fellen; and whan\nCleodalis was so mate that he myght no lenger helpe, than\ndiffended the kynge, and whan the kynge was so feinte that he\nmyght no lenger, he cried and seide to the stiward, \"Ha!\nCleodalis, feire frende, diffende youre body, for I may no\nlenger.\"  And he lept vp, and bad hym be sure and haue no drede while\nthat he myght lyve.  Thus contened these two goode men a-boute\nmydnyght, and than com Merlin prikinge and his companye; and\na-noon Merlin cried to his felowes, \"Now let se who is a knyght;\nhere may ye prove youre hardynesse and youre prowesse, and be\nnot dismayed though thei be many, for ye shull haue socour of a\npartye of youre felowes.\"  Than thei smyte in a-monge hem with\nso grete raundon as horse myght renne, and slough and maymed\ngrete plente, but soone were thei at grete myschef, but yet thei\nsmote hem so in her comynge In, that thei be come to the worthi\nmen vnder the Oke, that yet foughten as well as thei myght, but\nmoche was a-peired theire strengthe and her breth.  Than were\nthei harde rescowed and sette on horse who it grucched, and than\nwere thei xxv knyghtes full noble men and well helpinge, and\nmany thei kilde and maymed.  But whan Isdras and Acalas and\nColocallus saugh the grete damage that so small peple hem dide,\nthei helde ther-of grete dispite, and than thei cried vpon here\nmen, \"Now, gentill knyghtes, at hem; haue ye not shame that\nso fewe peple so longe agein vs endure that yet we be vij Ml fightinge men, and thei ne be but oon handefull of peple.  Now lete\nvs a-venge the damage that thei haue us don to oure\nfrendes.\"  Whan the sarazins vndirstoden this thei ronne vpon hem and\nharde thei hem assailed; and than thei hem diffended right wele,\nand gretly were thei to a-lowe and to preise.  Ther dide Arthur\nmerveilles, and the kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors and Nascien; these foure were paraunt a-bove alle the tother, ffor these\ndide soche prowesse with her owne bodyes that it was wonder;\nand the other xxj diden well also the ton for the tother that\nmerveile was it to wite how thei myght so moche suffer or\nendure.  And whan Merlin hadde brought hem in medle, he lefte hem\nand rode in to the foreste, and mette with other xij knyghtes and\nbrought hem to the bataile; and than be-helde Nascien and\nAdragains, and saugh thei were of her felowes of the rounde\ntable.  Than be-gan the stour full merveillouse; and Merlin rode\na-gein in to the foreste where hym liked, and the xxxvij knyghtes\na-bode stille a grete while, that moche prowesse dide of armes;\nand a litill a-fore day Merlin come a-gein with xx knyghtes in\nhis companye; and thei smote in to the medle a-noon as thei\nwere come, ffor well thei were a-raied of armes and of horse,\nbut well it shewed by theire armes that thei hadde not alwey\nleyen at reste. Whan thei come to the bataile her felowes were at grete\nmyschef, and thei ronne amonge hem with swerdes\ndrawen and slough and caste down in her comynge all that thei\nraught, and thei saugh this that were come firste how thei were\nof the rounde table.  Than com that oon a-gein the tother, ffor\nthei were full noble and hardy, and Merlin was a-monge hem,\nthat bar the dragon; and than he com to Arthur and to the\nkynge Ban and to the kynge Bohors, and cleped hem to hym, and\nthei com.  \"Will ye wite,\" quod Merlin, \"how these shull be\ndiscounfited?\"  And thei seide that thei wolde fayn knowe in\nwhat manere.  Quod Merlin, \"Ther ben but foure in this place\nthat hem holde to-gether.\"  \"And whiche ben thei?\" quod kynge\nBan.  \"Sue me,\" quod Merlin, \"and I shall hem yow\nshewen.\"  Than Merlin smote in to the presse so harde that he bar down\nwith his horse breste whom that he mette, and bar the dragon in\nhis hande, that yaf so grete light that oon myght well se a-nother;\nand whan Merlin mette the thre kynges he shewde hem to the\nkynge Arthur, and seide, \"Now may ye assaye the gode swerde\nthat ye haue conquered.\"  And he be-heilde hym that he hadde\ndesired gretly for to seen, and thought wele that it were thei that Merlin hadde spoken of; but neuer so soone myght he not\ncome, er Nascien mette with the kynge Colocaullus and smote\nhym with his swerde vpon the helme that he slitte his heede to\nthe teth, and he fill down deed.  \"Now let se,\" quod Merlin,\n\"what ye will do, for now is ther oon lesse.\"  And Arthur, that\nhilde the goode swerde drawen, smote the kynge ysdras, that he\nmade the heede falle to grounde; and the kynge Ban smote Acolas,\nthat the shulder disseuered from the body so depe that the longes\napered; and the kynge Bohors smote Dodrilas an Amyrall thourgh\nthe helme to the brayn.  And whan the other felowes saugh how\nthese foure hadde don so well, than thei yaf hem a fressh assaut,\nthat there was noon but he made a sarazin falle to grounde, owther\ndeed or wounded.  And whan the Geauntes saugh hem deed that\nwere lordes and her gouernours, and the grete damage that these\nhem diden, thei seide that a grete fole were he that wolde suffre\nto be slain; and than thei turned to flight thourgh the foreste\nthat noon ne a-bode other.  And thei wolde hem haue enchaced, but Merlin seide \"Nay, recche not hem nothinge yow to chace,\nffor soone shull thei mete with folke that shall do hem I-nough of\nsorowe and care.\"  And than thei gan to repeire a softe paas till\nthei come to the issu of the foreste, and than gan it to shewe day,\nwhan thei com to the tentes ther the cristin were logged, and the\nwacche hem knewe and com hem a-geins and made of hem grete\nioye, ffor well thei wende that alle hadde ben deed; and a-noon\nwas the tidinges knowe thourgh the hoste that com was the kynge\nArthur and his companye.  And the kynge leodogan made\nappareile her mete grete plente, for thei hadde fasted longe, but first\nthei slept and rested; and whan thei weren vp and redy thei ete\nand dranke grete plente, ffor I-nough thei hadde wher-of, and\nalso thei hadde it well deserued; and whan the clothes and the\nbordes weren vp, thei dide geder all the grete auoir that thei\nhadde conquered, and sette it all on an hepe; and Arthur it\ndeparted be the counseile of Merlin, that the kynge leodogan\nwolde not medle ther-in, for nothinge neuer after he hadde yoven\nhis doughter to kynge Arthur, and that he knewe hym and the\ntweyne noble kynges that with hym weren, he wolde nothinge hym entermete but hem to serue and honouren with all his\npower.  And whan Arthur hadde departed all the auoir that nothinge\nwas lefte, he lete enquere thourgh the hoste yef ther were eny\nyonge bachelere, that wolde ought gete or wynne and go with hym\nther as he wolde hem lede, and he wolde hem yeve so moche at\ntheire repaire, that neuer after sholde thei be power.  And than\nther com so many of oon and other, that it was a wonder, ffor\nmoche thei desired to be in his companye for the grete valour that\nwas in hym euer more; and than thei swore and seiden that thei\nsholde hym neuer faile.  And he with-hilde in to a xx ti Ml , and\nmoo he myght haue hadde yef he wolde, but he seide he wolde\nnot lete the reame be vnstuffed of peple, but thei myght hem\nwell deffende yef eny enmyes entred in to the londe; but thus\nmoche he seide, that yef nede were and that he sente for hem, that\nthei sholde come to hym.  And thei ansuerde, and seide thei wolde\nwith goode will, were it neuer in to so straunge londe thei wolde\nhym serue. And than departed thei a-sonder, and the kynge Arthur, and\nthe kynge Bohors, and the kynge leodogan, and the\ncompanye of the rounde table, rode forth to Toraise and the xx ti Ml sowdiours of Tamelide, and whan thei hadden riden a-while, the\nkynge Bohors toke leve and rode to the Castell Charroye, and\nledde with hym the xl felowes, that thei hadde brought in to\nTamelide, and as many knyghtes of that reame, that thei were\nwell v C , and so thei spedde her iourneyes that thei com to the\nCastell of Charroye with-oute eny encomber, and ther thei made\nof the kynge Bohors grete ioye, ffor longe hadde he not be ther\nbe-fore, and ther he a-bode viij dayes full.  But now resteth the tale\na-while of hym and of his felowes, and of the kynge Arthur and\nhis companye, and returne to speke of the kynge Amaunt, that\nfaught with the kynge Galad. Full grete was the bataile and the stour mortall, ther as the\nkynge Amaunt and the kynge Galad weren I-mette, ffor\nthe sarazins were x Ml ; but many ther were of goode knyghtes\nand hardy and yonge bachelers with the kynge Amaunt.  And\nthe bataile dured so all day, that alle the x Ml were disconfited ne hadde ben oon a-uenture, ffor the meyne of ysdras, that were\nwell v Ml , that all nyght hadde foughten with the kynge Arthur in\nthe foreste, happed to falle to hem, and that was for hem gret\nmyster, ffor the x Ml were so beten and slain, that ther was lefte\nbut v Ml .  Ther was stronge stour and mortall, for thei were at\ngrete myschef the peple of kynge Amaunt.  But yet this helped\nhem wele, for the sarazins weren wery for trauaile, and that all\nday be-fore hadde foughten in bataile, and waked all nyght, and\nther-fore thei were the more hevy and at mysese; but so fought\nthei on that oon part and on that other, that the kynge Galad\nturned to the flight all disconfited, and ne escaped past vij Ml that\nalle ne were slain and hewen, and of the peple of kynge Amaunt\nne lefte not right many.  Ther hadde the kynge Amaunt grete\nlosse of peple, and grete doell made thei that were lefte a-lyve\nfor her frendes.  That nyght logged Amaunt and his men by a\nlaunde side in the wode, and were full mate and pensif for her\nkyn and frendes, that thei saugh ly in myddes of the launde, and\nmade so grete sorowe, that of all that nyght thei neither ete ne\ndranke.\" On the morowe were the bodies sought, and leide on a\nmounteyne, and made grete diches in the erthe, and caste in the\ncorses, and while thei thus were at soiour, ther com tidinges how\nthe kynge Bohors was come to the Castell of Charroye for to se\nthe place, for longe hadde not he ben there, and than the kynge\nAmaunt enquered how moche peple he hadde brought in his\ncompanye, and it was tolde hym, that thei myght well be vj C , and\nthan he seide to his counseile, that he wolde not entre in to the\nlonde, for hym was lefte so small peple, but he wolde aspie to\na-bide hym in some place on the wey, ffor thei ben but v C and we\nben yet vij C , and yef thei come I hope to spede all other-wise\nthan and thei a-bide.  Thus devised the kynge Amaunt his volunte\nwhere-of he myght wele have a-biden yef hym hadde liked; but\nmany a man weneth to a-venge his shame that it doth\nencrece.  But now cesseth a litill while of the kynge Amaunt and of kynge\nBohors till a-nothir tyme, and speke of the kynge Arthur and his\ncompanye, that gon towarde the town of Toraise. Whan the kynge Arthur and his companye com to Toraise,\nthei were richely resceyved with grete honour; and\nther thei soiourned two dayes, and the thridde day com the\nkynge leodogan to the kynge Arthur, and hym somowned to\nspousen his doughter Gonnore; and Merlin seide that he moste\nfirste do a-nother grete werke; and the kynge asked what; and\nMerlin seide that he moste firste passe in to the reame of Benoyk,\nand tolde hym for what nede; but that was in counseile, for he\nwolde not haue the thinge knowen of no man that sholde go\nthider.  And whan he herde the nede, he praide hym to repeire\na-gein as sone as he myght.  And Merlin seide he neded not\nnothinge ther-of hym to prayen, and bad make hem redy, \"for\nto-morowe moste we remove.\"  Quod Arthur, \"Shall we not\na-bide the kynge Bohors, that is at the Castell of\nCharroye?\"  Quod Merlin, \"Ye shull a-byde hym at Bredigan, youre\ncastell.\"  And Arthur seide that all sholde be at his wille.  Than thei hem\nappareilleden, and on the morowe sette hem on here wey.  And\nso departed the kynge leodogan and the kynge Arthur, and kisten\nat the departynge; and Gonnore hym praide soone to come a-gein,\n\"ffor neuer,\" quod she , \"shall I be in ese of herte vn-to the\ntyme that I yow se a-gein.\"  And the kynge seide that he wolde\nhe were come a-gein oute of the contrey.  And the kynge  Ban\ntoke a messager, and sente to the Castell of Charroye to the kynge\nBohors his brother; and thus departeden oon from a-nother.  And\nthe kynge Arthur and Merlin wente be-fore, and the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table, and the xx Ml sowdiours that he hadde\nwith-holden in that londe.  And the kynge Ban sente to his brother\nBohors to come to hym to Bredigan, ffor thei were on the weye,\nand ther-fore he sholden hym haste as faste as he myght; and so\nspedde the messangier that he com to the kinge Bohors, and tolde\nhow his brother was in the weye after the hoste, that be-fore hym\nwente; and the kynge Bohors so dide also; and hym conueyed\nGuynebans his brother till he com in to the foreste perilouse, that\nafter was cleped the foreste saunz retour, as the booke shall\nreherse hastely.", "20": "CHAPTER XXI. ADVENTURES OF BAN AND GUYNEBANS; BOHORS' FIGHT WITH AMAUNT; MEETING OF THE CHILDREN WITH KING ARTHUR. Whan the kynge Ban and Guynebans his brother were entred\nin to the foreste, thei ne were but lx in her companye,\nand fill that thei entred in to a grete high wey, and rode till thei\ncom depe in to the foreste, and than thei fonde a-uenture full\nmerveillouse, ffor thei fonde a medowe that was closed a-boute\nwith wode, and fonde with-ynne the feirest daunses of the worlde\nof ladies, and of maydenes, and knyghtes, the feireste that euer hadde thei seyn in her lyve; and on the tother side thei sigh a\nscaffolde, and in that scaffolde sette a knyght that was of a l\nwynter age, and ther satte also the feirest lady of the\nworlde.  And whan the kynge saugh the lady of so grete bewte, he light\non foote, and Guynebans his brother, and alle the other wente fort\nto se it; and whan she saugh hem com, she roos a-geins hem as\nshe that was curteys and well lerned, and voyded hir wymple,\nffor well she wiste thei come for to see; and hir salude the kynge\nthat spake firste, and she salued hym a-gein full debonerly, and\nthan thei satte alle vpon the fresshe herbes and grene, and\nbehelden the feeste and the ioye and the carols that thei saugh\nbefore hem.  And Guynebans be-helde the lady with goode chere,\nand so moche he his herte and his entente, that she satte so nygh\nhis herte that he thought on no-thinge but vpon hir.  And than\nseide the maiden, that goode fortune hadde that lady that soche\nioye myght haue euer hir lif with-oute faillinge. Whan Guynebans vndirstode that how the lady seide, he\nseide that she sholde it haue, yef the lettynge were not in\nhire; and she seide that in hire sholde it neuer be letted.  \"Now\nI praye yow,\" quod she, \"telle me how.\"  \"Certes,\" quod\nGuynebans, \"yef ye will yeve me youre love, for alle dayes of youre\nlif, I shall make the carole endure in this manere, that alle men\nand wymen, that come this wey and se the carole thei shull a-bide and make ioye, till that a knyght come that neuer in his lyf falsed\nhis love, and with that also he moste be the beste knyght that\nshall be in his tyme.\"  And she seide that sholde she neuer see,\nbut praide hym to holde that he hadde hight.  \"Now telle me,\"\nquod Guynebans, \"hadde ye euer eny lorde?\"  And she seide,\n\"Nay;\" but that she was as clene mayden as whan she com oute\nof her moder wombe; \"and also,\" quod she, \"I am lady of the\nreame cleped the londe susteyne.\"  Than seide Guynebans that\nhe was redy to parforme the couenauntes ;   and she graunted\nas for hir parte as she that was of grete bewte.  And the olde\nknyght seide that he sholde do sette ther a cheyer, that euer\nmore sholde be redy for the knyght in to sitte, that sholde be so\ntrewe in lovynge whan he were come.  And the kynge Ban seide,\nsith it is come here-to that he sholde haue a riche crowne of\nhis, with the whiche the knyght sholde be crowned, for well he\nhadde it deserued.  Than assured to-geder Guynebans and the\nmayden for to holde couenauntes with goode herte and trewly\nwhile hir lif dured.  In soche manere, seide she, that yef\nGuynebans deyed firste be-fore hir, that the carole sholde not lette till\nthat he com, that neuer hadde be false in his lovynge.  Than caste\nGuynebans his enchauntements, and stablisshed the caroles like\nas ye haue herde, that neuer sholde cesse no tyme, till that he\ncom, saf the right hour of dyner and of soper, and the resonable\nhoures to slepe and reste.  And whan the carole was sette and\nstablisshed, than seide the mayden, that he sholde make yet\na-nother pley that neuer myght faile, and that all the worlde\nther-of myght speke after his deth.  Than Guynebans hym-self\nmade with his owne handes a Chekier of golde and Ivory half\nparted, ffor he was right sotill of soche crafte, as he wolde hym\nentirmete, and the pownes, and all the other meyne were golde\nand yvory fresshly entailled. Whan Guynebans hadde made redy the Cheker and the\nchesse, that oon myght well ther-with pleyen alle that\nwolden, he made soche a coniurison by his art, that alle tho that were sette for to pleyen, ther ne sholde be noon, but that the\nchesse sholde hym maten, wheder he wolde or noon, in that oon\nof the corners of the cheker; ne neuer sholde the same cheker be\nmated, till the beste knyght of the worlde dide it mate, and also\nhe moste be of soche grace, that neuer he falsed his love, and\nther-to hym be-hoveth to be kynges sones and quenes.  Thus as\nye haue herde hath Guynebans stablisshed the carole and the\nChekere, and after made he many a feire pley, and taught the\nmayden, wher-with she wrought many tymes, after that he was\ndeed; and after made he the castell Tornoyier, and the karoles\nthat Meranges fonde after at the Citee of Nameles, where as noon\narraunt knyght sholde not cesse to karole, till that a certein\nknyght com thider.  In soche manere were bothe karoles wrought,\nand whan Guynebans hadde made this thinges, departed the\nkynge Ban with all his companye, and than Guynebans hym\nconveyed on his wey, and soone after departed, and comaunded\nthe kynge to god, and returned a-gein to his lady, and ther was\nafter all his lif.  And the kynge rode till he com to Bredigan,\nwhere the kynge Arthur was, and a-noon as Merlin saugh hym\ncome. he lough right lowde, and the kynge Arthur asked whi he\ndide so laugh.  And than he toke the kynge Arthur, and the\nkynge Ban by the handes, and drough hem a-part, and Merlin\nasked of the kynge Ban, and coniured hym by the feith that he\nought vn-to hym, whi it was that he lough.  And Merlin seide\nit was for Guynebans.  And than he tolde to Arthur of alle the\npleyes and caroles that Gynebans hadde made for his love, and\nthan lough Arthur, and seide to the kynge Ban that this mariage\nwolde he haue stole hadde no Merlin I-be.  And thus thei laughed\nand iaped, and the kynge Ban asked of Merlin, yef he knewe\nwhat the knyght was, that sholde make the Carole to cesse, and\nMerlin seide that he was not yet nother gete ne born, and\nther-fore ne enquereth no more ther-after, for ye shull wite more at\nleiser.  Thus thei soiourned at Bredigan at ese and ioye, and\na-boode for the kynge Bohors. Whan the kynge Bohors hadde soiourned at the castell of\nCharroye viij days, the barouns of the contrey made him grete ioye, and on the ix th day brought hym on his weye\nffragein the Castelein more than half a myle, and than departed\nthat oon from the tother; and as soone as the kynge Bohors was\ndeparted fro the Castell, the kynge amaunt hadde witinge by\nasspie, that tolde hym how he yede to Bredigan, where the kynge\nhis brother and the kynge Arthur dide hym a-bide.  Than the\nkynge Amaunt made his peple lepe to horse, and were of hem\nvij C that were lefte of the bateile, and rode forth till thei come to\nthe foreste perilouse at the entre towarde the Castell of Charroye,\nther as the kynge Bohors sholde come; and on that other side\nlogged hym in tentes and pavilouns with-ynne the foreste, that he\nwere not parceyved till thei saugh the kynge Bohors come; and\non that other side the kynge Bohors com ridynge till he com ther\nas the kynge Amaunt was a-bidinge, that made his peple hem to\narme. Whan the kynge Bohors saugh the pavilouns, he asked\nwhat peple thei were; and oon seide that it was kynge Amaunt,\nthat was com thider hym for the espie; and whan he vndirstode\nthat, than he drough hym a litill a-side by a river and comaunded\nhys men hem to arme hastely.  Thus were bothe partes armed\nall nyght, and on the morowe as soone as thei saugh the day\nappere, bothe parties lepte to horse and rode eche a-gein other,\nand whan thei saugh that thei sholde mete, the kynge Bohors\nsente to the kynge Amaunt for to come speke with hym sool\nby hym-self, and he com with goode will, ffor he was a goode\nknyght and a trewe; and as soone as thei were mette, than seide\nthe kynge Amaunt, \"Sir, this is soth that ye haue sente for me\nto speke with yow, and I am comen for to shewe how ye do me\ngrete wronge of a castell of myn that ye haue me be-rafte, and\nther-fore I pray yow that my castell be to me a-gein delyuered,\nbe couenaunt that I shall be youre frende for euer more er eny\nmore debate ther-fore be made.\"  \"Sir,\" quod the kynge Bohors,\n\"as touchinge the Castell, I toke noon from yow, but he toke it\nto whom the fee be-longed, and that was Vterpendragon, of whos\nsoule god haue pite, whos man ye owe for to be and yelde hym\nservise.  But ye were so full of pride that ye deygned not to do\nhym seruise ne homage, and ther-fore he toke it fro yow, for ye wolde not be his man, and yaf it to me for to kepe, for many day\nI haue hym serued.  And yet shall I make to yow a feire plee:\ncom with me to Bredigan where the kynge Arthur me abideth,\nand do hym homage, as the barouns seyen that ye owe for to do,\nand I shall yelde yow the castell all quyte.\"  \"Will ye noon\nothirwise do?\" quod the kynge Amaunt.  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge\nBohors, \"no; for of yow I holde right nought, but be-come\ntrewe liege man to the kynge Arthur, and I shall yelde yow the\ncastell that I haue in my baillye.\"  \"That will I not do,\" quod\nthe kynge Amaunt, \"ffor neuer will I ben his man.\"  \"And\nseth ye will not leve my counseile, that I can no more\nsey.\"  Than seide Amaunt, \"Ye haue brought hider with yow a fewe\npeple, and also I haue here a fewe of myne, and yef we fight\nto-geder it may not be with-oute grete harme on bothe sides, but\nther-fore lete vs do in other manere.  Ye be here for the right of\nkynge Arthur that ye holde for lorde; now lete vs than fight\nto-geder body for body, by this couenaunt: that yef ye me\nconquere the Castell to be youre quyte, and I to go with yow to\nBredigan and do homage to the kynge Arthur for all my londe,\nI and alle my barouns; and yef it be so that I yow conquere,\nyelde me the Castell and go yowre-self quyte, for other thinge of\nyow will I not aske, and thus may ye eschewe alle periles and\nstintyn alle strives.\"  \"And yef oon of vs dye,\" quod the kynge\nBohors, \"what shall come ther-of thanne?\"  Quod Amaunt, \"Yef\nye me sle, my men shull go with yow, and do homage to the kynge\nArthur; and yef so be that ye be slain, the Castell to be myn,\nand alle youre men to be quyte, and go what wey thei will,\nand yef thei will be-come my men, I will right gladly hem\nreceyve.\" Than thei assured to holde these covenauntes, and made alle\nhir men to be sworn to holde the same with-oute\nfaile.  Than wente the two lordes in to a faire launde, and thei were\nwell armed at alle poyntes, and eche of hem helde a grete spere\nwith hedes of sharpe grounde stiell, and bothe were thei moche\nknyghtes and stronge and of high prowesse, but the kynge\nBohors was somwhat the larger man of bones.  And as soone as thei com in to the launde, Vlfin com to hym, a Bretell, and Kay,\nand Gefflet, and Antor, and alle xl knyghtes of her companye,\nand seide, \"Sir, what purpose ye to do? will ye fight with this\nkynge body for body?  Doth not so, but go we on hem alle\nto-geder, for thei shull not a-gein vs endure, for haue ye no doute,\nthough thei be moo than we, thei shull be disconfited.  Neuer\nmote the kynge Arthur vs holde but we hem conquere , and make\nhem alle come to youre mercy or thei shull alle be deed; and on\nthe tother side, yef we suffre yow to fight in this manere, we\nshull be blamed of youre brother, and of the kynge\nArthur.\"  \"Holde youre pees,\" quod the kynge Bohors, \"for sithe he hath\nme atised to bataile I will it neuer leve, for than sholde I neuer\nhaue honoure, and therfore speke no more ther-of, I praye yow,\nfor my love.\"  And whan thei saugh it wolde noon othirwise be\nthei it suffred. On the tother side bith come to kynge Amaunt, Gingabresell\nand his lorde Brandelis, and seiden, \"Sir, what is this\nthat ye will do? so wise a man as ye be, ought not soche thinge\nto vndir-take to put hym-self in a-uenture of deth for covetise of\nlonde, ne other auoir.\"  Quod Amaunt, \"God helpe me neuer\nyef I do euer other-wise, for owther I will all gete or all\nlese.\"  \"Now I shall telle yow, than,\" quod Geromelans, \"what ye shull\ndo: take the bateile a-gein the beste knyghtes of theym yonder,\nand we shull fight with hem, and so may we be of yow more\nsure.\"  \"Neuer noon other,\" quod the kynge Amaunt, \"shull\nfight saf he and I, for so haue I hym ensured and he me.\"  \"Now\nwite ye well, than,\" quod Geromelans, \"yef yow mys-happe, as\ngod diffende, we will make hym noon homage, ne the kynge\nArthur, ne no man that of yow eny londe doth holde.\"  Whan\nthe kynge Bohors vndirstode the contencion of the kynge and his\nnevewes, he cleped Vlfin and Geret de lamball, and seide, \"Go\nto the kynge Amaunte, and sey I sente hym to wite that I\nwolde he make no pleet, ne noyse to no man of his companye, of\nthat he hath me graunted, ffor yef it falle that I haue of hym\nthe better, I will that alle his men go quyte where so thei\nwill.\"  And thei wente and tolde to Amaunt as the kynge Bohors hadde hem comaunded; and whan Amaunt herde this he comended hym\nmoche.  Than he com in to the myddill of the launde, where the\nkynge Bohors a-bode redy, and a-noon as the kynge Amaunt was\ncomen, thei with-drough a-side of bothe parties, and thei moved a-noon as thei that thought longe it taried er the bataile were\nbe-gonne.  Thei leide theire speres be-fore theire brestes, and\nsmote theire horse with the spores, and mette vpon the sheldes\nand with helmes, and hurteled so to-geder, that eche of hem was\nso a-stoned, that hem semed that the fire fill oute of her\niyen.  And it fill that the kynge Amaunt fell of his horse to grounde so\nastonyed, that he wiste not whether it was nyght or day; and so\nhe lay longe while at the erthe.  And the kynge Bohors was also\nso sore astonyed of that harde encountre, that he lay longe while\nvpon the arson of his sadill; but well he kepte hym from fallinge,\nfor he was of grette prowesse, and a-roos lightly and drough oute\nhis swerde, that was of grete bounte, where-with his sone Lyonell\nafterwarde yaf many a grete stroke, as ye shull heren her-after\nrehersed whan tyme cometh. As soone as the kynge Bohors hadde oute his swerde he smote\nfaste a-boute hym, and wende to fynde the kynge\nAmaunt.  Than he be-helde and saugh he lay at the erthe vp-right, and he\nhelde the swerde in his honde all naked, and griped his shelde,\nand come to hym that yet lay on the grene, and putte the poynte\nof his swerde on his shelde and be-gan to pouke hym, and cleped,\n\"Rise vp, kynge Amaunt, for to longe haste thow slepte and the\nday passeth, and I haue moche for to ride, and ther-fore thow\ndoste no curteysie to tary me so longe.\"  After a longe while the\nkynge Amaunt com oute of swowne, and hadde herde the kynge\nBohors clepe, and vndirstode what he seide, and preised hym\nmoche in his herte for that he hadde so longe a-biden hym\nwith-oute smytinge, and that he was more curteyse and deboner than\nhe wolde haue ben to hym yef he hadde ben in his power.  Than\nhe lepte vpon his feet lyghtly and drough oute his suerde oute of\nscauberke that was full fyn, and was a-shamed for that he hadde\nfounde hym at erthe ligginge; he couered hym with his shelde,\nand com to the kynge Bohors and caste at hym a stroke, and he caste his shelde ther a-gein, and he smote so harde that he slitte\nit to the bokell; and the kynge Bohors yaf hym a-gein soche a\nstroke thourgh the helme that he slytte it in two partyes, that it\nfill down a-boute his sholderes that it toke a-wey his sight from\nhis hede.  Whan he felte hym-self so blynded he lepte bakke and\ncutte a-sonder the laces of his helme and caste it a-wey, and than\ncouered hym with his shelde, for sore he douted his heede,\nwhereon was no more but the coyfe of mayle.  Whan the kynge\nBohors saugh the kynge Amaunt that so hadde loste his helme,\nhe cleped to hym and seide, \"Kynge Amaunt, come make pees\nwith the kynge Arthur, and do hym his homage, for grete damage\nit were yef thow sholdest here thus dye, ffor thow seiste how it is\nthe be-fallen, and yet thou art of feire age, and me hevyeth sore\nthe to sle.\"  \"But thow,\" quod the kynge Amaunt, \"yelde the\nand putte the in my mercy.  Trowest thou me so soone to haue\nconquered, for myn helme that I have caste of, that dide me but\nnoye.  Now deffende the, for I the diffye,\" and with that the\nkynge Amaunt ran on hym right wroth, and wende to smyte\nhym on the heede, but the kynge Bohors, that moche cowde of\nskirmerie, resceyved the stroke on his shelde, and he smote so\nharde that a gret quarter fill on the launde.  Than launched oute\nthe kynge Bohors a grete stroke, and made semblaunt to smyte\nther as he wolde not, and Amaunt caste ther agein his shelde,\nand the kynge Bohors with-drough his stroke a-nother wey,\nand smote the kynge Amaunt on the heede, that he cleft hym\ndown to the sholderes, and he fill deed to the erthe\nvp-right.  Whan the kynge Bohors saugh the kynge Amaunt dye, he was\nright sory, and seide he hadde leuer haue take hym, quyk,\nand that he sholde haue made his pees with the kynge\nArthur.  And whan Guygebresill, and Brandelis, and Guyromelans saugh\nthe kynge Amaunt was deed, thei turned with CC knyghtes,\nand seide that neuer sholde thei love the kynge Arthur, ne\nno man that to hym belonged; and CCC be lefte, and seide\nthei wolde go with the kynge Bohors to the kynge Arthur\nand do theire homage, ffor a better lorde than he myght thei\nnoon haue. Whan the kynge Amaunt was deed the kynge Bohors cleped\nhys companye, and seide that gladly wolde he ther make\nan hospital where-ynne a man myght euer after serue oure lorde\ngod for the soule of hym as longe as the wolde dured, and that\noure lordes body myght be sacred ther-ynne, and his seruyse seide\nand don, for the victorye that god hadde hym yoven.  Ther was\na clerke that many a day hadde hym serued, and he com be-fore\nthe kynge and asked of hym this yefte, and seyde he wolde gladly\na-bide there yef hym liked; and the kynge hym graunted, and yaf\nhym rentes, and lefte with hym of his auoir grete plente for to\nmake the hospitall, and ther lefte the clerke in this manere, that\nwas after a goode man and a holy of lif.  And whan the kynge\nBohors hadde made entiere the kynge Amaunt, and by-sette the\nrentes to the clerke, he rode forth till that thei com to Bredigan,\nwhere that he fonde the kynge Arthur, and the kynge Ban, his\nbrother, and Merlin, that to hym made right grete ioye.  As soone as the\nkynge Bohors was a-light, he seide to the kynge Arthur, \"Sir,\"\nquod he, \"here be a party of the knyghtes of the kynge Amaunt,\nthat beth come to yow in my condite, and sey that thei will do\nhomage and holde theire londes of yow, and thei be worthi men\nand riche and high Barouns, as I am do to vndirstonde, of the\nbeste of that londe.  Now, take theire homages, and hem resceyveth\nas ye owe to do.\"  And the kynge Arthur seide \"thei be welcome,\nand wite thei right well, that neuer will I do to hem but well\nwhile that thei will me love, ffor thei love me and I will love\n hem, and yef thei me hate I shall hem haten.\"  And these com\nforth and dide hym homage a-bouten CCC; and whan thei hadde\ndon theire homage the kynge Arthur asked hem tidinges of the\nkynge Amaunt, and what man he was in his contrey; and thei\ngonne to wepe sore, and seiden how he was deed. \"How,\" qoud Arthur, \"sey ye trouthe that he is\ndeed?\"  and thei seide, \"Ye, with-oute faile;\" and than thei\ntolde all the trouthe how the kynge Amaunt departed oute of his\nlonde for to go to the Castell of Charroye, and how thei wente\nbe-fore in to the wey, ther the kynge Bohors sholde come for to\nfight with hym, and how thei foughten body for body, and how the kynge Amaunt was deed, and tolde hym all theire traueyle,\nthat nothinge lefte thei vn-tolde that thei cowde on\nthenke.  Whan the kynge Arthur and the kynge Ban herden of the\nprowesse that the kynge Bohors hadde don thei were gladde, and\npreised hym moche and comenden; and alle men seiden a-noon\nas thei it wisten, that neuer hadde thei herde of two so noble\nmen as were the two bretheren, and seide well that yef thei two\nne hadde not ben, the kynge Arthur hadde all loste.  Thus thei\nsoiourned at Bredigan thre dayes full, and than sente the kynge\nto enquere for workemen and labourers with mattokkes and\nshoveles till he hadde well v C .  Than thei wente to the tresour,\nas Merlin hem taught, in the foreste, and lete digge in the erthe\nand fonde the tresour that neuer er was seyn, and toke it oute of\nthe erthe, and charged Cartes and Chariettes in tonnes, that thei\nhadde brought thider grete plente; and whan thei hadde all the\ntresour charged, thei made it to be condited to logres, where as\nArthurs nevewes dide a-bide.  And Merlin made hem digge depe\nvndir an Oke till thei fonde a vessell of lether, and ther-in xij\nthe beste swerdes and the feirest that eny man nede to\nseche.  These ledde the kynge Arthur to logres with his tresour, till that\nthei were come to Court, that thei sholde on be emploide.  And\nas soone as the children herde speke that the kynge Arthur\nhir oncle was comynge, thei lepte on theire horse and rode agein\nhym alle to-geder, that noon ne lefte but wente alle gladde and\nmyrie that neuer peple myght make more ioye.  And whan thei\ncom nygh, Merlin toke the kynge Arthur a-part and the two\nkynges, and made hem a-light vnder a feire tre, for to a-bide the\nchildren that com, and comaunded her hoste to ride all wey forth\ntill that thei come to logres, and take theire logginges, and ese\nhem all by leiser.  And whan thei herde the comaundement of\nthe kynge thei passed forth with-oute more a-bidinge, and mette\nwith the cheldren, that com with grete Chyuachie.  And whan\nthei mette the routes, thei asked where was the kynge Arthur;\nand thei hem shewde the tre ther he was a-light; and the\nchilderen hem dressed that wey that moche hem dide haste.  And\nGawein wente be-fore, that thei helde for maister and lorde, and thei hadde right, for he was the beste taught and the moste\ncurteise that euer was, and in whom was lefte vilonye, and the wisiste\nthat myght be whan he com to Chiualrie. Whan thei com to the tree ther the kynge was a-light,\nand these other two kynges with hym, and the knyghtes\nof the rounde table; and as soone as the children hem saugh thei\na-light a-foote from theire horse and wente a-foote ther as these\nknyghtes were sette vpon the fresshe herbes in the shadowe of\nthe foreste; and hem a-venteed and keeled, for it hadde be hoote\nall the day, and the hadde riden all the day armed, for doute of\nthe saisnes that were in the londe, and it was a-boute the ende of\nmaye.  Whan the knyghtes of the rounde table saugh the children\napproche nygh, that eche hadde take other hande in hande\ngodely, and alle were thei well clothed, and richely a-raied and\nfull of grete bewte, and semed well that thei were alle come of\ngode issue, and it be-com hem well, that thei com so entreprised,\nand thei helde it a grete debonerte that thei helde to-geder so\nfeire.  And whan the knyghtes hem saugh come, thei roos a-geins\nhem; and whan thei com nygh Gawein hem salued, that was of\nthe chief and the eldeste, and than he seide, \"Feire lordinges,\nwe seche the kynge Arthur, wherefore we praye yow that ye will\nvs shewen where he is, that we may hym knowen.\"  At this\nworde ansuerde Nascien, and salued hym a-gein debonerly, and\nseide, \"My feire sones, lo, hym yonde, ther tho noble men ben\nsette, and he is also the yongeste of alle,\" and shewde hym with\nhis fynger.  And whan Gawein hym saugh he paste forth, and seide,\n\"Sir, gramercy,\" and com that wey ther the kynge was and his\nfelowes; and thei stode vpon foote, as soone as thei saugh the\nchildren come. Whan Gawein saugh his oncle and his felowes, he and alle\nthe children kneled down and salued the kynge and his\ncompanye, for hym and his felowes that were with hym\nI-comen.  \"Sir,\" quod Gawein, \"I am come to yow, I and my brethern\nand my cosins, as to my liege lorde, and these other be come also\nfor the goode that thei here speken of yow, and for to seche oure\narmes of yow, and that it plese yow for to make vs knyghtes, and shull gladly yow serue, as we owe to do, yef oure seruise\nmay yow plese, and I sey not but that thei haue yow serued, ffor\nsomme ther ben here that, while ye haue ben oute of contrey, haue\ndeffended youre londe as wele as it hadde ben their owne a-gein\nalle youre enmyes, and have be in helpinge to alle hem that ye\nlefte it to kepe, and seth thei come, haue thei suffred many a\ngrete trauaile, and I will well that ye it wite, for to a goode man\nther sholde be reported honour and bounte whan he hath don,\nand of a shrewe oweth oon consele, for he hath no herte it to\nguerdone, ner the iyen power a gode man to be-holde, ne to\nknowe the haluendell of the bounte that in hym is.\"  Whan\nthe kynge vndirstode the childe that so wisely spake, he toke\nhym by the hand, and a-noon comaunded hem alle to a-rise;\nand thei did his comaundement.  And than the kynge a-resond\nhem, and asked of Gawein what thei were.  \"Sir,\" seide Gawein,\n\"er ye knowe more by vs wolde we wite youre volunte, and after\nthat demaunde vs that yow plesith, and we shull telle yow gladly\nthat we knowen.\"  Whan the two kynges herde the wordes of\nthe childe, thei helde hym right wise, and seide to the kynge\nArthur that he seide right.  And than spake the kynge Arthur,\nand seide, \"Ffeire frendes, I will with-holde yow with right\ngladde chere, and will make yow knyghtes, bothe yow and youre\ncompanye of myn owne, and ye be right welcome, and I will\nthat fro hens-forth that ye be my frendes and my felowes and of\nmy prive counseile and lordes of my court.\"  And whan the\nchilderen herde how the kynge spake, thei kneled and hym\nthonked; and the kynge toke hem by the hondes, and seide to\nGawein, \"Ffeire frende, now telle me what ye be, and of youre\nfelowes telle me the verite, ffor longe me thinketh it to wite.\" \"Sir,\" quod the childe, \"men clepe me by my right name,\nGawein, the sone of kynge loot, of leoneys and of\nOrcanye, and these thre that I holde by the hondes beth my\nbrethern, and the name of that oon is Agrauayn, and the tother\nis Gaheret, and the thridde Gaheryes; and oure moder hath do\nvs to vndirstonde that she is youre suster on hir moder side; and\nthise gentilmen ben oure cosins germain, as oure auntes sones, and the name of the lesse, that is shorte and fatte, is Galashin,\nand is sone to kynge Ventre, and this other, that is longe and\nyonge, is sone to kynge Vrien, and his name is Ewein, and this\nGentilman is his brother on his fader side, and is cleped also\nEwein, and these tweyne other, that ye se holde to-geder, thei be\ngentilmen of high lynage, ffor this feire broun is sone to the\nkynge Belinans, of South walis, and is nygh cosin to Galashin;\nand these other tweyne be nevewes to the kynge of Strangore\nand ben nygh sibbe to Galashin; and these other tweyne ben\nnevewes also to the kynge of Strangore, and the name of that\noon is Kay destranx, and the tother Kehedin; and these other\ntweyne, that ther stonde to-geder, aperteyne to the kynge loot,\nmy fader, and be Erles sones, and oon is cleped Ewein white\nhande, and the tother Ewein esclins, and the tother Ewein Cyuell,\nand the tother Ewein de lyonell; and this other gentilman, that\nis of so grete bewte, that is so moche and semly and well shapen\nof body and of alle membres, is nevew to the Emperour of\nCostantynnoble, and his name is Seigramor, and is come with vs\nbe his debonerte and his fraunchise to take armes, and that ye\nhym make knyght, and he will yow gladly serue with gode will,\nand will that he and I be felowes in armes while hym liketh to\na-bide in this contrey; and these other gentilmen that ye seen\naboute vs where-of be so grete plente ben alle frendes and\nkynnesmen, and haue lefte her londes and hir honours for to come serue\nyow for the grete love that the haue to yow.\" Whan the kynge Arthur hadde herde Gawein thus speke, he\nleide his arme a-boute his nekke, and seide, \"He is right\nwell-come,\" and hym kiste These three words are obliterated in the MS. and made of hem grete ioye, and\nthan his brethern and his cosins, and to segramore he made\nmerveilouse ioye; and whan he hadde welcomed hem alle, than he seide\nto Gawein, \"Gawein, feire nevewe, com hider, and that I yow\nenffeffe ye will take the Constabilrie of myn housolde and of all the lordship of my londe after me, and fro hens-forth to be lorde\nand comaunder of alle hem that ben in my londe, for I will it so be.\"  And Gawein kneled, and seide, \"Sir, gramercy;\" and the\nkynge hym feffed with his right glove, and than he reised hym\nvpon his feet, and than lept to theire horse, and rode forth to\nlogres.  And whan the kynge entred in to the Citee his suster\ncom a-gein hym, the wif of kynge loot of Orcanye, and with hir\ncom Morgne le fee, hir suster, that was so grete a clergesse.  And\nwhan the kynge hem knewe he made of hem grete ioye, for longe\ntyme hadde he not hem sein; and thei kissed as brother and\nsuster.  And thus thei come to the maister paleys, that was\nhanged with clothes of silke, and strowed with fressh herbes softe\nand swote smellinge, and maden grete ioye thourgh the town all\nday on ende and all nyght, so that no man may reherse the ioye,\nand the gladnesse of all the peple.  The same nyght the kynge\ncomaunded the children to go wake in the cheiff mynster till on\nthe morrowe be-fore messe, that no lenger he wolde a-bide.  And\nthe storie seith this was the quynsyme after Pentecoste; and ther\nwas the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and lxj knyghtes of\nthe rounde table with these children all day, that hem in no wise\nwolde leven. Whan it com be-fore the tyme of high messe, Arthur toke\nCalibourne, his gode swerde, that he drough oute of the\nston, and by the counseile of Merlin ther-with he girde Gawein,\nhis nevewe, and than he sette on the spore on the right hele, and\nthe kynge Ban vpon the lifte hele, and after that the kynge\nArthur yaf hym the acolee, and bad god make hym a gode\nknyght, and after he a-dubbed his thre brethern also, and yaf\neche of hem a suerde of tho that were founde in the tresour that\nMerlin taught; and than the tweye sones of kynge Vrien, and\nthan Galashin, and Dodinell, and Kay, and Kehedin, and to\neueriche of these he yaf a swerde of the tresour; and than the\nkynge a-dubbe Seigramor, with soche garmentes as he hadde\nbrought from Costantynnoble, for he was come well a-raide of\nalle thinges that be-hoveth to a newe knyght; and the kynge\ngirde hym with a gode swerde, that he hadde brought out of\nConstantynnoble, that his graunsire the kynge Adrian hadde hym\nyoven; and than he sette on his right spore, and the kynge Bohors his lifte spore, and than the kynge Arthur yaf hym the\nacolee; and than he dubbed the iiij cosins, Ewein White honde,\nand Ewein Esclyn, and Ewein Cyuell, and Ewein de lyonell, and\nAlain and Acon, and to ech of these v he yaf a swerde of tho that\nwere of the tresour; but the storie seith that Dodynell hadde\nnoon, but he hadde the swerde that was the kynges Amaunt,\nand the kynge Bohors hym it yaf, for that he was somdell of\nhys kyn. Whan these children were thus a-dubbed, than eche of hem\na-dubbed soche companye as thei wolde lede of soche\nas thei hadde brought with hem; and whan thei were alle redy thei\nwente to high messe, that the archebisshop sange, and whan masse\nwas don thei com a-gein to the paleise to mete, and ther helde\nArthur grete court and grete feste, and it nedith not to speke of\nthe meesse ne the seruise that thei hadde that day, for it were\nbut losse of tyme; and after mete wolde these yonge bachelers\nhaue reised a quyntayn in the medowes, but the kynge hem\ndiffended by the counseile of Merlin, for that the contrey was so\ntrouble and full of werre, and the cristin sore turmented with\nsaisnes that were entred in the londe.  Thus lefte the enuysenx\nof these yonge bachillers and newe knyghtes at this tyme, and\nsoiourned in the town iij dayes.  And the kynge departed grete\nrichesse to yonge bachelers that he with-heilde, that of alle parties\nwere come grete plentee, ffor ther com so many of oon and other\nthat thei were lx Ml what on horsebak and on foote, with-oute\nhem that he hadde brought out of the reame of Tamelide.  And\nin the mene-while that thei soiourned in the town, Morgne le fee\na-queynted hir with Merlin, and was with hym so prive, and so\nmoche she was with hym that she knewe what he was, and many\nmerveilles he hir taught of astronomye and of egramauncye, and\nshe helde it right wele.  And on the thridde day spake Merlin to\nthe kynge, and badde hym appareile for to move, ffor Pounces\nand Antony and ffrolle ben entred now in to the reame of\nBenoyk, and also the peple of the kynge of Gaule, and also\nClaudas the kynge de la desert.  And Arthur seide he was redy\nto go whan hym lyked, for he a-bode but his comaundement. Than seide Merlin, \"Comaunde alle youre hoste to be redy\narmed for to move at mydnyght, and take with yow of\nthis londe xx Ml , and xx Ml of the reame of Tamelide, and xx Ml ye\nshull leve in this town, ffor this reame may not be lefte\nwith-oute peple, and lete Doo of Cardoell of hem haue the gouernaunce;\"\nand thus ended her counseile.  And than the kynge comaunded\nGawein as Merlin hadde seide, and a-noon Gawein dide his\ncomaundement, and made hem redy appareilled; and hem\ndeparted and disseuered a-sonder, and hem he logged in the medowes\nof logres alle that sholde with hem go.  And whan he hadde do\nthus he com to the kynge and to Merlin, that he saugh in\ncounseile to-geder, and seide how all was redy.  And whan Merlin\nhym saugh, he bad the kynge aske hym what was the knyght\nthat ledde hym to socour his moder in the medow of\nglocedon.  And he hym turned and seide, \"Sir, how knowe ye this, and\nwho hath this to yow I-tolde.\"  \"Certes,\" quod the kynge, \"he\nthat tolde me knoweth alle these thinges well I-nough.\"  \"So\nhelpe me god, sir,\" seide Gawein, \"I knowe not what he was,\nfor I saugh hym neuer be-fore ne after.\"  \"Now,\" quod Merlin,\naske hym yef he knewe hym that brought hym the letter from\nhis cosin Ewein, the sone of kynge Vrien.\"  And whan Gawein\nsaugh and be-helde hym that satte by the kynge, he asked whi\nhe made the kynge hym so demaunde; and than he be-thought\nhym a-gein wisely, and remembred the wordes that Doo of\nCardoell hadde to hym seide.  And the kynge asked yef he hym\nkenned.  And he seide, \"Nay; but oon dide me for to\nvndirstonde that it was Merlin, but trewly I knowe hym not; and\nmany other bountees and seruyses hath he me don, ffor\nSeigramor, the emperoures nevew, he made me delyuer from pereile of\ndeth, and my moder, and my cosin Ewein, and also oure-self at\nthe castell of Arondell, and he is the man of the worlde that I\nwolde faynest knowe this day.\"  \"Ye shull knowe hym I-nough,\"\nquod Merlin, \"whan hym liketh.\"  Than be-gan the kynge to\nlaugh right lowde, and seide, \"Gawein, feire nevew, sitte down\nhere by me, and I shall telle yow that I knowe.\"  And he sette\nhym down be the kynge, and ther were no mo but thei thre. Than seide the kynge to Gawein, \"Feire nevew, lo, here the\ngode man by whom ye wente to the Castell of Arondell, where\nthat ye fought with the saisnes that day that Dodynell the sauage\nand Kay destranx and his neveu com oute of her contrey; and\nther-fore now thonke hym of the servises that he hath yow don,\nand well ye owe so to do, and to love hym for his gode herte that\nhe hath to yow.\" \"Sir,\" seide Gawein, \"I can not I-nowgh hym quyte as he\nis of worthynesse, but thus moche I sey, that I am all\nhis and at his comaundement, and he is so wise that knowe I\nwell that he knoweth all my corage that I haue to hym.\"  And\nhe seide, \"Ye,\" that he knewe well his herte, and that he wolde\nwith hym ben a-queynted and be oon of his privees; but he bad\nhym that he sholde not telle no creature of nothinge that he seide\nto hym were he neuer so pryve ne frendly; \"and ye shull se me,\"\nquod he, \"in so many gises that I will not be knowe of no man,\nffor moche is the enuye for covetyse in this worlde.\"  And Gawein\nseide that neuer wolde he speke ther-of to no creature of the\nerthe.\"  Thus was Merlin aud sir Gawein a-queynted be-fore his\nOncle; and whan thei hadde longe spoke to-geder, than seide\nMerlin, \"Feire frende, go take youre leve of youre moder, and\nthan goith to the hoste, and make youre peple go to horse-bak\na-noon after mydnyght, and than goith forth youre wey towarde\nDover to the portes, and do appareille vesselles and assemble\nshippes at the ryvage, so that youre vncle, whan he cometh and\nthe two kynges in his companye, that beth worthy men, may\nentere with-oute lenger lettinge; and, for godes sake, loke ye do\nhem worship and honour, ffor though thei be the kynge Arthurs\nmen, yet ben thei comen of higher lynage than is he; and loke ye\nlete no man knowe what wey that ye shull go.\"  And Gawein\nseide it sholde be don as he hadde devised.  Than departed\nGawein, and toke leve of his moder, that was right wise and moche hym loved, and comaunded hym to god to diffende hym from\neuyll.  And he departed and com to the hoste, he and his brethern,\nand sir Ewein, his cosin, that moche hym loved, and Galashin, and\nDodinell, and Seigramor, and Ewein a-voutres, and the foure cosins that alle were cleped Ewein, and Kay destranx, and\nKehedin, his nevew, these ne departed gladly a-sonder; these hadde\nthe hoste in gouernaunce, as sir Gawein hem assigned, so that alle\nwere at the comaundement of my lorde sir Gawein.  And a-noon\nafter mydnyght Gawein made trusse sommers and other cariage,\nand made goode wacche a-boute the hoste, that ther ne ascaped\nnoon aspie; and thei hit kepten that the booke hath rehersed, and\nthan thei rode forth a softe paas till thei come to the port of\nDover.  And the kynge Arthur a-bode at logres, and Merlin, and\nthe kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and the xlj knyghtes that\nthei ledde in to Tamelide, and the knyghtes of the rounde\ntable.  And sir Gawein made serche all the ryvages, and take shippes\nand assembled a grete navie.  And whan Merlin knewe that all\nwas redy, he sente to the kynge, and made hym move be nyght,\nand seide er thei moved, that thei sholde a-ryve at the Rochell, and\nbadde hem do make her men rowe hem vp thider, \"and whan ye\nbeth a-rived, loke that ye move not till that ye se me a-gein.\"\nQuod the kinge, \"Shull ye not than come with vs?\"  \"No,\"\nquod Merlin, \"but ye shull ly ther but oon nyght, whan ye shull\nse me with yow.\"  With that departed that oon from that other,\nand Merlin wente in to Northumbirlonde to Blase, his maister, that\nof hym was right gladde, for hertely he hym loved, and asked\nhym how he hadde don seth he departed; and he hym tolde alle\nthe thinges as thei were be-fallen, and Blase hem wrote in his\nbooke; and whan Merlin com to that he be-hoved to telle of the\ndamesell that he loved paramours; and Blase was ther-of right\nhevy, for he douted she wolde hym disseyve and that she sholde\nlese his grete witte, and he gan hym to chastise; and he hym\ntolde soche prophesies as were for to come, and of other that\nsholde falle in other londes, as ye shull here here-after, and alle\nblase wrote in his boke; but now returne we to speke of the\nkynge Arthur.", "21": "CHAPTER XXII. BATTLE BEFORE THE CASTLE OF TREBES. Now seith the storye, that the firste day of Iuyn departed\nthe kynge Arthur from Logres, and in that mery seson\nrode Arthur forth, and the two kynges with hym, till thei come\nto Dover, and entred in to the shippes with-oute more tariynge,\nand hadde goode wynde and softe, and goode maroners hem for\nto gide, till thei come to the Rochell with-oute eny trouble or\nannoye, and logged hem in tentes and pavelouns with-oute the\ntowon, and abode Merlyn, and he com on the morowe at mydday as\nhe hadde promysed the kynge Arthur, and the thre kynges made\nto hym grete ioye, and namely Gawein that hym loved so well,\nand Merlin loved hym for the grete trouthe that he knewe in hym,\nand ther thei soiourned, and rested and maden goode waicche on\nthe weyes and passages, that noon wente ne com that eny tidinges\nmyght brynge to theire enmyes.  But now resteth a while of hem,\nand returne to speke of Leonce, the lorde Paerne, and Pharyen of\nTrebes that were so goode men and trewe to theire lorde. Whan Merlin was departed from Leonce of Paerne, and hadde\ntolde hym that Pounce and Antony and her companye\ncom with xx Ml men of armes, and ffrolle a Duke of Almayne with\nxx Ml , Leonces sente for peple fer and nygh of kyn and frendes and\nsowdiours, till he hadde x Ml of the reame of Benoyk of horsmen\nwith-outen fote-men with whiche he stuffed his forteresses, and\nPharien on that other side com oute of the reame of Gannes with\nx Ml horsmen, with-outen the peple on foote whiche he lefte to\nkepe the Citees and Castelles, and brought viteles on alle parteis\nin to stronge townes, and closed the prayes from theire enmyes\nthat nought myght thei wynne on forreye, and whan thei hadde spedde so all theire ordenaunce, Pharien drough hym to Gannes\nwith all his hoste, and Leonces in to Benoyk with all his hoste,\nand a-bide so in this manere till tydinges com to hem, that her\nenmyes were entred into the londe that sette on fire ouer all\nther as thei myght eny harme do; but litill thei founde in the\ncontrey to take to, ffor all was turned from theire power into\nstronke fortresses, and therfore Claudas de la desert was full of\nsorowe and hevynesse, for well he supposed ther-by that thei\nhadde some warnynge in some manere of her comynge.  But yet\nther-fore ne lefte not the forreyours to renne thourgh the londe,\nbut litill cowde thei fynde, and whan thei hadde ronne vp and\ndowon thei repeired agein to the grete hoste, and than toke\ncounseile what thei sholde do, and than thei a-corded to sette seige\nbe-fore the castell of Trebes, and thider thei rode and loigged hem\nin the medowes ther-by, but it was fer of, ffor the castell stode\non an high hill, and at the foote of the castell was the maras, depe\non alle sides, and ther-to was noon entre saf a litill cawchie that\nwas narowe and straite of half a myle of lengthe.  In these\nmedowes loigged hem Pounces and Antonyes on that oon side, and\non that othir side ffrole the Duke of Almayne, and on that othir\nside Claudas de la deserte, and on the fourth parte the peple of\nthe kynge of Gaule; that Randolf, the stiwarde of Gaule, dide\ncondite, whiche was a bolde knyght and an hardy, and eche of\nthese hadde xx Ml men at his baner.  Thus was the castell of\nTrebes beseged on foure parties, and kepte so cloos that noon\nmyght entre ne come oute, but that he were a-noon taken and\nwell thei wende to take the castell be famyn, ffor of noon assaute\nhadde thei no drede, for noon myght come ther-to for the maras\nthat was so nygh, and thus thei be-seged longe the quene Helayne\nand hir suster that were with-ynne, and hadde grete drede leste\nthei sholde haue be taken some maner treson; and many tymes\nthei wepten for theire lordes, that so longe hadde ben from hem\nand thei hadde herde of hem no tidinges.  And Grascien hem\ncounforted wele and badde hem be nothinge dismayed, ffor\nwithynne shorte tyme thei sholde have socoure, and seide he dide but\na-wayte vpon the hour that theire tweye lordes were comynge. In this maner dide Grascien hem counforte, and his son Banyns,\nto a-voide the hevynesse of the two quenes. This Banyn was a bolde squyer and hardy, and nygh cosin\nto Leonce the lorde of Paerne, that was cosin to the two\nkynges, and whan he knewe that the Castell was be-seged, he\nsente to Antyaume the stiwarde, that he sholde come speke with\nhym.  And he come a-noon in all haste, and than Leonce badde\nhym appareile his men, ffor this nyght, quod he, be-hoveth vs to\nride, and ye and youre peple shull a-bide me in the foreste of\nbriogne at the welle in the myddell of the launde, and loke ye\ndemene yow so, that noon knowe what wey we shull ride, and\nsette soche warde a-boute the hoste, that noon departe to telle eny\ntidinges to oure enmyes, and he seide this sholde be do so that in\nhym sholde be no defaute.  With that departed Antyaume the\nstiwarde, and dide as Leonce hadde hym comaunded.  And Leonce\ntoke his nevew and sente hym to Gannes to Pharien and badde\nhym come in to the foreste of Briogne, in to the place that was\nassigned in soche as he knewe was myster; and this spedde hym\nso that he dide his message well and feire.  And whan Pharien\nthat Leonce was meved on his wey, he arraied hym hastely and\ngarnyyshed the town with soche peple as he saugh was nede, and\nrode forth be the moste vn-cowthe weyes that he knewe, and\nhadde in his companye well x Ml , and also Leonce rode forth, he\nand Antyaume, till thei com into a grete valey, all closed with\nwode, in the foreste of Briogne, as Merlin hadde hym\nassigned.  And the hoste was so well kepte that noon issed oute; and ther\nthei a-bode till that Pharien com with his peple; and ther thei\ndide a-bide till on the monday be-fore the feste of seynt John,\nthat moste be on the sonday next after.  And whan Merlin knewe\nthat thei were redy, and that thei abode but the socour that he\nhadde hem promysed.  Then he it seide to the kynge Arthur,\nand to kynge Ban, and to his bro\u00fe\ner, and to Gawein, these\nv were of oon counseile.  And than seide Arthur to Merlin,\n\"What shull we do now in this?\"  Quod Merlin, \"I will a-noon\nright that ye devide youre peple who shall go be-fore, and who\nshall go after.\"  Quod the kynge, \"Devise it ye, for ye knowe beste what is for oure moste spede.\"  \"With gode will,\" seide\nMerlin, \"but this may not be taried.\" Than Merlin firste of all called Gawein and seide, \"Goode\nfrende, take x Ml men of soche as yow like beste, saf only\nthe knyghtes, of the rounde table for hem shull ye not haue, but\nye shull haue the xl knyghtes that youre vncle, the kynge, and\nthe kynge Ban brought oute of Tamelide; and ye shull haue also\nthe newe knyghtes and take with yow as many of other that ye\nbe x Ml in all; and drawe yow in to a parte of the felde, and take\nyoure baner to Vlfin to bere, whiche is a noble knyght and right\ntrewe, and do this a-noon right.\"  Whan Gawein herde the\ncomaundement of Merlin he departed, he and his felisship and Vlfin,\nand stode a-side with x Ml on a part by hem-self.  And than Merlin\ncalled the kynge Ban and seide, \"Kynge Ban, com forth gentill\nkynght, for ye shull lede the secunde bataile, and ther shull be\nx Ml in youre companye, and we shull se how well ye shull do for\nthe socoure of youre londe, and how ye will yow a-venge vpon\nClaudas for the damage that he doth in youre reame, and doth\npurchese euery day.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge Ban, \"so be it as\nye will devise, and yef ever I shall haue ioye, it is thourgh god\nand yow, and by my lorde the kynge Arthur.\"  Quod Merlin,\n\"Go, dissever youre peple, and a-raie hem a-noon for to ride\na-gein her enmyes.\" Than the kynge Ban dissevered oute x Ml men on a part of yonge knyghtes and noble men of armes.  After\nthat Merlin cleped the kynge Bohors, and seide, \"Sir, ye shull\nlede the thirdde bataile, and in youre companye shull be the foure\nhundre knyghtes of the londe of the kynge Amaunt, and of hem\nof Carmelide, so that ye be x Ml men well araied, and whan tyme\nis sette yow on the wey delyuerly, and loke that in yow faile no\nchyualrie, ffor now shall it be sene how ye will do for to delyver\nyoure enmyes oute of youre londe.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge\nBohors, \"we shull do as will vouchesafe, the beste that we may;\"\nand than the kynge Bohors dissevered his peple, and made hem\nto be armed and lepe to horse. Then seide Merlin to the kynge Arthur, \"Sir,\" quod he,\n\"ye shull lede the fourthe bataile, and in youre companye shull be the knyghtes of the rounde table, ffor thise shull\nnot faile yow for no drede of deth.\"  Than the kynge comaunded\nNascien, and Adragain, and Hervy de rivell, to arme and aray\nhem; and thei so diden in all haste.  Than toke Merlin the\ndragon and cleped kay the stiward, and seide, \"Sir, ye shull\nbere the baner of the kynge Arthur, for it is youre right; and\nloke that in yow be shewed knyghthode, and wote ye what ye\nshull do.  Ever whan ye come vpon youre enmyes loke that ye\nride streight to the grete baner.\"  And Kay toke the baner and\nseide, \"Sir, with goode will.\"  Whan these wardes were departed\nand dissevered, it was wele a-boute mydday, and thei made hem\nredy and sette hem to mete; and whan thei hadde eten, the lordes\nyode to counseile, for to aske Merlin what thei sholde do.  Quod\nMerlin, \"I shall telle yow this nyght at the firste somme ye shull\nmeve so that to-morow at even ye be at Trebes; and thei ly ther\nat sege in foure places, ffor euery prince holdith his siege by\nhym-self; and in euery part is xx Ml men and euerich of oure\nwardes shall go smyte on euery hoste, so that thei be assailed on\nalle foure partes.  But thei make gode waicche and stronge,\nand ther-fore we moste worke wisely.\"  \"How, Merlin,\"\nquod Arthur, \"have thei than moche more peple than we\nhaue?\"  \"Ye, Sir,\" quod Merlin, \"more be the haluendell; but ye shull\nhaue feire socour of xx Ml men that shull come to yow all be tyme,\nffor thei loigge but foure myle from the hoste, with-ynne the\nforeste of brioke.\"  \"And how shull thei knowe oure\ncomynge?\"  quod the kynge.  \"Sir,\" seide Merlin, \"I shall go for to fecche\nhem.\"  \"Who shall than condite oure hoste?\"  quod the\nkynge.  \"Blioberis,\" seide Merlin, \"shall go be-fore that well knoweth\nthe passages by the wey that I shall hym tecche, and in the\ndawnynge of the day loke ye sette on alle to-geder ther as ye\nshull here an horne blowe right high and lowde, and ye shall se\na grete flame of fier renne a-bove in the heir on high, and ther-of\ntake goode hede; ffor than shall the socour be redy that I shall\nyow sende.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge, \"whan shull ye meve\nthidirward?\"  \"A-noon right,\" quod Merlin, \"for in this may\nbe no tariynge, and ther-fore to god I yow comaunde.\" With that departed Merlin from the kynge Arthur, and\na-noon, as he was oute of the hoste, he vanysshed a-wey\nso sodeynly that thei wiste not were he be com, and er it was\npassed noone of the day he com into the hoste of Leonces of\nPaerne, that a-boode nothinge elles but tidinges that he sholde\nlepe to horse; and than com Merlin be-fore hym ther as he and\nPharien were, and Antyaume and Grascien.  And than seide\nMerlin, \"Leonces, what a-bidest thow?  whi got thow not to\nhorse, thow and thy peple?  ffor thow canst not come so soone\nthider, but thow shalt fynde ther the kynge Arthur with all his\nhoste.\"  And whan he vndirstode that, he made hym grete ioye,\nand seide that he was welcome, and so seide all the companye;\nand a-noon thei asked tidinges of theire lordes, and he seide that\nin short tyme thei sholde hem well seen, \"ffor thei ride now a\ngrete spede; but devise a-noon youre wardes and I shall lede\nyow to the hoste.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Leonces, \"gramercy, ffor now\nknowe I well that we shull spede well while ye be in oure\ncompanye.\"  With that wente the foure felowes, and departed her\npeple into foure parties, and the stiwarde toke v Ml and dissevered\nhem on a part, and Grascien other v Ml , and Pharien other v Ml ,\nand Leonces toke theym that was lefte, that were well v Ml and\nmoo, and made hem to be well armed and a-rayed.  But now\ncesseth a while of Merlin, and of leonces, and speketh of the kynge\nArthur and his companye. Now seith the storye that as soone as the kynge Arthur and\nMerlin were departed; the same hour Arthur dide meve\non his iourney euery warde after other, and Blioberis rode in the\nwarde of sir Gawein all be-fore, as he that beste knewe the\npassages.  Ther myght oon haue seyn many a riche garnement and\nmany a fressh banere of riche colour wave in the wynde, and the\nseson was myri and softe, and the contre feire and delitable,\nffor many feire medowes and forestes ther weren, in whiche these\nbriddes singen with lusty notes and cler, and than reioyse the\ncorages of these yonge lusty bachelers that to conquere loos and\npris and honour haue lefte theire londes and her contreyes, and\nthe swete songe of these briddes remembred their armous whiche thei were wonte to haue the presence, and some dide sighe full\nofte, and so thei ride forth all the nyght till it was cleir day, and\nwhan thei be-heilde a-boute hem and saugh, thei knewe not in\nwhat parte thei weren; ffor so moche thei entended to theire\nmyry thoughtes that hem plesed that all other thinge was leide\na-side.  With that thei be come into a feire launde full of floures\nvpon the river of leire, and this launde was full of floures and\nswete herbes and grasse that the horse wente ther-ynne vp to the\nbelyes, and ther thei resten all the hoste of Arthur all the day\nvnto euesonge tyme, and ete and dranke thei that ther-to haue\nnede, and slepe at her ese for the place was plesaunte and\ndelitable, and than thei hem armed more and lesse and lepte to horse, ffor thei hadde but vij myle for to ride to the hoste ther as was\nClaudas.  Ther sholde ye haue sein many fressh lusty men of\narmes vpon stronge startelinge stedis, and swyfte rennynge well\ncovered vndir stiell, and many a riche cote of armes of silke\nembrowded of dyvers colours, and many a grete spere with\ntrenchaunt hedes of sharp grounde steill, and many an helme and\nmany a shelde glistred a-gein the sonne, and rode so cloos oon\nafter a-nother that whan thei were renged that oon myght have\ncaste a glove vpon theire helmes that sholde not have falle to\ngrounde, er thei hadde ride a butte lengthe.  And Blioberis rode\nin the vaungarde with sir Gawein, and the kynge Ban in the\nsecounde warde with x Ml men of armes, and rode a softe paas,\ntheire sheldes be-fore theire brestes, with goode talente to assaile\ntheire enmyes and hem-self to diffende, and rode half a myle after\nthe forwarde.  Whan the kynge Bohors saugh his brother forth\nthan he dressed hym and his peple after vpon her wey, and hadde\nmany a bolde knyght and hardy, and that was well seene that\nday in the bataile be-fore the castell of Trebes.  And he cowde\nhem lede and condite and hem helpe and socour in euery nede,\nwhan the kynge Bohors was departed and dissevered.  Than\nArthur and his peple made hem redy to folowen after, and whan\nthey were on horse ye sholde have sein many a riche garnement\nand many a bolde knyght that neuer wolde faile the kynge Arthur\nfor no drede of deth.  And Kay rode with the baner in his hande that Merlin hadde hym delyuered; and thus thei ride streite and\ncloos after the kynge Bohors the space of half a myle, and thus\nthei rode all the nyght till a litill be-fore the day that thei were\noute of the foreste of brioke, and were come into the playn and\ncom alle after a longe while be the river vnder leyer vnder the\nwode side, where as thei resten vnder the Olyves till thei sie the\nsigne that Merlin hadde hem tolde of the braundon of fier that\nsholde renne-vp in the heir; and that thei herde the noyse of the\nhorne that sholde blowe; and thei approched so nygh the hoste\nthat it was but v bowe draught be-twene; and thei saugh in the\nhoste was grete plente of lightes and moche peple, and thei herde\nthe horse neye and the mules crie often, and thei were so nygh\nthat ech hoste herde the noyse of other, and thei that kepte\nwaicche at the siege sente oute men on horsbakke to aspie what\npeple it were, and thei yeden oute and saugh their armes and\nreturned agein to the hoste, and tolde how thei hadde founde grete\nplente of men of armes.  Whan thei of the hoste herde these\ntidinges thei ronne to arme hem, and issed out of the loges and\nrenged hem in the playnes euerich at his baner, and eche man,\nlete other haue witinge that a grete armee was come vpon theym\nand thei wiste not what peple.  And Pounces and Antonye, that\nmoche cowde of werre, issed oute of the hoste all armed in to the\nforeste of Bryoke, in to the wodes evese ther as thei sholde come,\nand comaunded her peple hem for to sue, and thei so dide\ndelyuerly as soone as thei were armed.  And ffrolle the Duke of\nAlmayne come oute after and made his stablie vpon a litill river\nthat is cleped Aroaise, and Randolf the senescall of the kynge of\nGaule come by the gardins, and Claudas the kynge de la desert sette\nhym towarde the cauchie towarde the maras that com out strongly\nfrom the loigges, and from pavelouns and gadered to the baners.

But after\nmydday was passed was no mannys doinge like vnto Gawein, ffor\nhe smote a-down man and horse be stroke of spere and suerde;\nand also dide well sir Ewein the sone of kynge Vrien and Ewein\na-voutres, and Ewein white hande, and Galashin the sone of\nkynge Ventre of Garlot; and Gaheries dide so well that euery\nman hilde hym the beste knyght after sir Gawein, and also\ndide well Agrauain and Gueheret and Segramor and alle the\nother felowes. On that othir side faught the kynge Ban full harde with the\nkynge Claudas and his peple, and ther was stronge bataile\nand many were ther throwen down to the grounde vpon either side; and happed so that the kynge Ban and Claudas metten in\nmyddell of the renges that were grete and perilouse, and as soone\nas eche hadde sight of other, thei ronne to-geder with swerdes\ndrawen, and Claudas was a noble knyght and a sure and moche\nand stronge, but he was euer enviouse a-gein alle tho that were\na-bove hym, and he smote the kynge Ban so harde vpon the helme\nthat the sparkeles estincheles. of fire fly oute brynnynge bright and astoned\nhym so sore that he enclyned on his horse son cheval. nekke; but with\ngrete vigour a-roos the kynge Ban and smote at Claudas to hitte\nhym on the parmi le. helme, and he saugh the stroke come and wevyd\na-side, and he smote so the horse nekke passinge and kutte col del cheual si le colpe. a-sonder the chyne, that he fill to grounde; but a-noon he lepe\non foote ryght hastely , moult iustement. but yet er he myght a-rise the kynge\nBan yaf hym soche two strokes vpon the helme that nere he que par poi quil. made hym to falle an knees and handes to the erthe, that the\nblode braste oute of his hede , parmi la bouce et parmi le nes. but the kynge Claudas was of\ngrete force and hym kepte so that he fill not but covered his\nheede si iete lescu sor sa teste. with his shelde, and com to the kynge Ban and be-gan\nbe-twene hem sore stronge bataile that was full crewell and\nfell and longe endurynge.

But his men\nhym socoured strongly, whereof he hadde mo than the kynge\nBan by the haluendell; and so were the peple of kynge Ban\ngretly ouer-charged, ffor thei were but x Ml , and thei with the\nkynge Claudas were yet xviij Ml , and not-with-stondinge thei\nfought so on bothe parties that the two kynges were remounted,\nand than be-gan the chaple full dolerouse and crewell and full\nmortall, but nedes moste the peple of kynge Ban refuse place,\nand yef he hym-self ne were alle hadde ben discounfited and\ndriven oute of the feilde, but he sustened the bataile so that noon\nmyght hym remeve more than it hadde ben a-dongon, and thus thei contened longe in this maner till that mydday was\npassed. On that othar side faught the kynge Bohors and Pounce and\nAntonye at the tentes and pavelouns, so that moche peple\nwere loste of hem that were there lefte, ffor ther thei loste the\nlyves; and whan Pounce and Antonye saugh the damage so grete\nthat so sodeinly was hem be-fallen he was wonder wroth and\nsorowfull; and whan he hadde assembled his men by the foreste\nwhere as thei dide a-reste, thei repeired toward the tentes where\nthei made this occision of hem that thei founden, and whan the\nkynge Bohors saugh hym come he rode a-gein hym full boldely,\nhis shelde aboute his nekke, with a grete growe spere of aissh\nwith a sharp heede of stiell, and whan Pounce saugh hym come\nhe launched in to the felde a-gein hym and smote the horse with\nthe spores a-gein hym in soche haste as he that trowed to haue\ntaried to longe, and mette to-geder with all the myght of bothe\nhorse that thei perced the sheldes, and Pounce brake his spere\nvpon the kynge Bohors, and the kynge smote hym so rudely that\nhe made the shelde and the arme close to his side and sente the\nspere heede thourgh shelde and side and made hym a grete\nwounde so that the reade blode railed oute after, and he shof\nther-on so harde that he bar hym to the erthe vp-right, and ther\nhe lay longe astoned that noon wiste wheder he were deed or a-lyve, mort ou uif. and whan his men saugh hym falle thei hadde grete drede\nleste he were deed quil ne fust mors. and ronne to the rescouse bothe gret and\nsmall, and the meyne of kynge Bohors come hem agens and hem resceyved lor uienent al encontre et les rechouient. at the spere poynte and ther was grete turment\nand mortall occision, for on oon parte were but x Ml and on that\nother side were xx Ml , fol. 155. car il furent dune part xx M et dautre part x M . and Pounce and Antonye was rescewed\nand si fu poince antoines rescous et. sette on horse, and his men founde hym somdell wounded in the left side, but he had no wound that was like unto his el coste senestre, mais il nauoit nu plaie que perilleuse fust a garir. deth, but he was more sorowfull for that he had been remeved out of his sadell than he was fu cheus que. for greef of his\nwounde, ffor neuer be-fore that tyme had he fought with\nany knyght that myght make hym remeve oute of his sadell, car onques mais nauoit widiet le archons pour le cop dun chevalier. and ther-for he wold right faine be a-venged of that shame si vengeroit moult uolentiers sa honte. yef he myght come in place, and than al sodeynly he droughe si traist. his swerde and rode in a-monge the turnement that longe\ntyme endured and at the laste it et lors auint. fill so that Pounce\nmette with the kynge Bohors that of hym-self shewde\nmervelouse dedes of armes, and as soone as he hym saugh he\nremembred how he hadde hym vn-horsed and wounded, and\na-noon he ran vpon hym with his swerde drawen and smote the\nkynge vpon the helme that he made hym to enclyne on his sadell\nbowe be-fore, and whan Pounce wolde have recovered a-nother\nstroke, the kynge spored his horse in to the stour and than\nreturned the horse hede and com with his swerde in his hande;\nand also Pounce com a-gein hym that moche hym hated, and thei\nhewen vpon helmes grete strokes that bothe were astonyed.  But\ntheire strokes were not alle I-like, ffor Pounce smothe the kynge\nvpon the helme that he enclyned vpon his horse crowpe, and the\nkynge redressed hym and yaf hym soche a buffet vpon the lefte\ntemple that the blode braste oute of mouthe and nose, and\nther-with he hurteled so harde on hym with strengthe of his\nhorse that Pounce fell to grounde and was so astonyed that he\nknewe not wheder it were nyght or day, and the kynge rode\nouer hym on horse bakke all armed so often, that he was all\nfor brosed and swowned for anguyssh, and the kynge hadde\ngrete talent to a-light for to smyte of his heede, but he hadde\nhym not a-right at his volunte.

Ther was Pounce remounted full egirly; but sore was he\ndiffouled and beten.  Than the stour be-gan to renewe, and\nthe peple of kynge Bohors were at grete myschef, for there\nenmyes were double so many as thei were.  But in this manere\nthei contened till mydday was passed, and on a-nother part the\nkynge Arthur faught full fiercely agein Randolf the Senescall,\nand the ffrensshemen, ffor he fonde hem in pavilouns moo than\nvij Ml that alle were to-hewen and slayn; and whan Randolf\nsaugh the grete losse and the damage, he was full sory, and in\ngrete ire com hym a-geins with xiij Ml men that weren lefte, and\nthei were bolde and hardy and desirouse to ben a-venged of the\ndeth of her frendes that thei saugh slayn be-fore theire iyen and iex si.

And whan these com on ther was so grete toile and romour\nof noyse that wonder it was to heere, and ther-with\na-roos so grete a duste, that the cleir sky wax all derk, and Kay\nhem pursude with the dragon in honde that Merlin hadde take\nhym to kepe, and hit caste oute of his throte many tymes so grete\nflames of fiere up in to the heire so horible that alle theire hertes\ntrembled of hem that neuer hadde seyn it be-fore, and seide oon to\na-nother that the worlde was nygh at an ende; and, neuertheles,\nthe dragon had grete significacion in hym-self, ffor it be-tokened\nthe kynge Arthur and his power; and the flame of fiere that\ncom oute of the throte be-tokened the grete martire of peple\nthat sholde be in his tyme, and the taile that was so tortuouse\nbe-tokened the grete treson of the peple, be whom he was after\nbe-traied that dide a-rise a-gein hym by mordred his sone that he\nbe-gat on his suster, the wif of kynge loot as ye haue herde\nrehersed be-fore, ffor whan Arthur after passed ouer see to fight\nwith the Emperour of Rome, and to take the reame of Gannes\nand of Benoyk for the wratthe of launcelot, that hadde hym\nlefte for a maltalent that was be-twene hem two for his wif, the\nquene Gonnere, that he was so moche with a-queynted as the tale\nshall declare here-after; but of alle these maters we shull cesse\nat this tyme till that the mater falle ther-to here-after that it\nshall clerly be expounded. Now seith the boke that grete was the bataile be-fore the\nCastell of Trebes of the peple of Randolf, and the meyne\nof kynge Arthur.  But Randolfes men haue for-sake place, and\nwere driven vpon the peple of Pounce and Antonye that full\nshort hilde the kynge Bohors and his men that grete nede hadde of\nsocour; and whan Pounce and Antonye sangh come theym that\nfledden, he com hem a-geins and cried his ensigne, and returned\nand ran firste upon the men of kynge Bohors; and whan these\nsaugh hem comynge thei relien and closed hem to-geder, and lete\nrenne at the meyne of Pounce Antonye; and the kynge Bohors\nwas so ouercharged that he was nygh discounfited and dryven\noute of the felde.  But as Kay com that moche hem counforted,\nand tho be-gan a stronge stour and mortall, and many were ther deed on bothe sides; and than thei hilde hem somwhat\nperingall; and also on that other side faught sir Gawein and ffrolle of\nAlmayne that he made hem resorte vpon the kynge Claudas that\nfaught a-gein the kynge Ban of Benoyk, that was at grete\nmyschef; and whan these foure batailes were come to-geder that\noon sustened longe that other, and grete was the martire and\nthe noise of strokes of suerdes and gleives vpon helmes.  But\nther dide Gawein wondirfull dedis with his handes, ffor neuer\nhad eny man seyn be-fore oo man a-lone do soche merveiles as he\ndide that day; and the storie seith that it was passed myd-day,\nand it fill that Gawein mette with the kynge Claudas that\nfaught with the kynge Ban, he and a hundred with hym, and\nthe kynge Ban hadde no moo with hym but xix, and ther-fore\nwas he at grete myschef; and whan Gawein com he made alle\nthe renges to tremble and fremyssh; and whan he saugh the\nkynge Ban in soche distresse he rode in a-monge hem, with his\nsuerde in hande, that was of grete bounte; and it happed that he\nmette firste with Claudas that sore hym peyned to greve the\nkynge Ban and his peple, and Sir Gawein lifte vp his swerde\nfor to smyte the king Claudas vpon the helme, and he hym\ncouered with his shelde; and Gawein hym smote so harde that\nhe made it to fle in two parties, and the suerde descended upon\nthe hynder arson of his sadell and slitte the horse a-sonder, that\nbothe fill to grounde, the horse and his maister; and so he rode\nforth and no lenger hym a-bode for that he knewe hym not,\nand mette so with Mysteres, that was a knyght of Claudas, and\nhe smote hym on the shulder that he slitte hym to the breste;\nand than he smote Antorilas that the heed fill in to the felde;\nand after he leide oute grete strokes on euery side, so harde that\nxx of hem hath he slayn be-fore the feet of kynge Claudas, and\nso he hym stired that noon durst hym a-bide a stroke. Whan the kynge Ban saugh the socour that god hadde hym\nsente, and he saugh the merveile of the yonge knyght;\nhe thonked and worshiped oure lorde, and than he com to hym\nand seide, \"Gawein, swete frende, ye be welcome at this grete\nnede, ffor, so helpe me god, the kynge Arthur hath well be-sette the lordship that he hath yow yoven to lede and gouerne his\npeple, ffor to a better than to yow myght he not haue yoven in\nall this worlde to olde ne yonge; and I praye yow that ye\nwolde graunte me youre companye this day fro\nhens-forth.\"  \"Sir,\" quod Gawein debonerly, \"I graunte it yow with gode herte,\nand I thanke yow of youre requeste.

Full grete prowesse dide Arthur and his companye of the\nrounde table; and the kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors\nwere nothinge at soiour, ne sir Gawein and his felowes, but\ndide soche occision of peple that alle the felde were couered\nof deed peple and wounded; and ther was so grete noyse,\nand so grete cry, that foure myle oon myght here the sound\nof hornes and trumpes; and whan thei of Trebes herde the\ncry and the shoute of peple, thei merveiled sore what it myght\nbe, and wente vpon the walles for to se the merveiles; and\nthe tidinges ther-of com to the two queenes that thei also\nbecome to the walles of the tower and be-helden oute of the\nwyndowes on high down in to the meedes and saugh the greteste\nnombre of peple that euer thei hadde seyn; and sye the dragon\nthat Kay bare, that caste thourgh his mouthe so grete flames of fire that all the heire that was thikke of duste wax all reade\nther as the dragon wente; and whan the ladyes and the peple\nof the town saugh that baner that neuer thei hadde seyen\nbe-forn; thei hem blesseden for the wonder that thei hadden, and\nthan thei dide enquere, and asked what peple thei were, and\nto whom that baner be-longed, and whan the messager com\nto the bataile he mette with a knyght of the ream of logres\nthat dide of his helme for to take a-newe, for his was all to\nrente, and the knyghtes name was Bretell; and the squyer com\nto hym and hym salude, and Bretell him ansuerde a-gein full\ndebonerly.  \"Sir,\" seide the squyer, \"I praye yow entirely\nthat ye will telle me what peple ye be, that fight so with the\npeple of this hoste, yef it yow not displese for to telle;\"\n\"ffeire frende,\" seide Bretell, \"now maist thow sey to hem\nther with-ynne the Castell that yow haue hider sente.

But thei of the Castell\nhadde but litill while be-holden the bateile, whan thei saugh\ncome oute of the foreste of brioke foure baners that com full\nsofte oon after another the space of a bowe draught, and whan\nthe baners approched ner, thei knewe the baner of Antyaume\nthe senescall of Benoyk; and the seconde, Grascien of Trebes;\nand the thridde, Pharien; and the fourthe, Leonce of Paerne;\nand whan thei of the Castell saugh hem thei weren full gladde,\nand fayn wolde haue issed oute yef thei myght haue hadde\nlicence; ffor ther-ynne were gode knyghtes and worthi men;\nbut it was hem deffended as dere as thei loved theire lyves, and\nAntyaume approched faste; and the kynge Ban be-helde and\nsaugh comynge these batailes, and knewe hem well, and shewde\nhem to sir Gawein.  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"nowe in shorte tyme\nshull oure enmyes be put bakke, and fayn to take flight for I\nse ther my baners that brynge vs riche socour, and thei be\nmoche to alowe;\" \"and where ben thei?\" seide Gawein.  \"Sir,\"\nseide the kynge Ban, \"lo hem yonder,\" and shewde hym with\nhis swerde, and whan that hem saugh he knewe well ther was\ngret strength of peple.

Ther was the signe cried lowde of the kynge Ban,\nand of the kynge Bohors of Gannes, and ther was many leide\ndeed to the grounde of men and of horse, whan that Grascien\ncom so harde vpon hem that thei moste nede forsake place and\nspredde a-brode in the felde, and than be-gan the bataile so fell\nmortall that many a fre modres childe lay stiked, and slayn\nthat litill hadde it deserued, where-of holy cherche was lessed\nfull sore of xx ti thousande peple that ther was slain of oon, and\nother and all that was for the vntrouthe of the kynge Claudas,\nthat after er he dyed he hadde euell myschef; ffor he starf in\ngrete age disherited as the story witnesseth; that Bohors toke\nso grete vengaunce after that Launcelot hadde the reame of\nLogres in hande, after the deth of kynge Ban, and the deth of\nkynge Arthur; ffor he toke the heed all white hoor in the\nforeste of Darmauntes, where he mette hym in gise of a\npalmer; ffor he was departed oute of the reame with-oute\nknowinge of eny man with thre knyves wher-with he wolde\nhaue morthered in treson, Bohors, and Lyonell, his brother,\nthat were so noble and hardy, as the tale shall shewe yow\nheere-after; and ye shull here how thei were kept and\nnorisshed by Nymyane, the lady de lak that Launcelot brought\nvp tenderly till he was a knyght.  But now of these maters\ncesseth at this tyme, and repeire to speke of the bateile,\nhow the hostes fighten in the playn felde be-fore the castell\nof Trebes. Full grete was the bataile and the stour mortall, where as\nthese wardes of Benoyk were entred, and medled with\ntheire enmyes a-gein the peple of ffrolle, Duke of Almayne, and\nagein the peple of Pounce Antonye, that alle were entermedled\nwith the peple of Arthur, that foughten full harde on that oo\npart and the tother; but whan thei were spradde a-brode in the\nfelde oon cowde not well sey who hadde the better, ffor thei\non Claudas side were yet xxxv Ml of fightinge men, and thei\non kynge Arthurs side were xxviij Ml , and so thei helde hem\nsom-what peringall; ffor the thre hundred knyghtes were\ndrawen oute on a part, and a-mended theire helmes, and\nrefresshed theire bodyes, and as soone as thei were departed the\npeple of Claudas recouered, and drof hem bakke of the reame\nof Logres more than thre bowe shote fro the castell, and of fin\nforce made hem forsake place, and the tentes and pavilouns that\nthei hadden take, and sesed; but in short tyme after the dedes\nwente all other wise, while that the Romayns, and the\nAlmaynes, and the peple of Gaule, and of la desert peyned hem\nto discounfite theym of the reame of logres and of litill\nBretayne, that moche hadde I-hadde the worse, and all day\nbe-fore hadde the better.  Thei merveiled sore where theire\nprowesse were be-come; but thei were not ther that hadde don\nthe merveiles in armes all the day be-fore, and therfore were\nthei gretly discounforted; ffor thei knewe of hem no tidinges,\nand eche man hym peyned sore to diffende his body, for well\nthei wende that thei hadde be deed that were wonte in euery\nnede hem to recouer, and while thei were in this turment\nCom Pharien of Gannes, with v Ml men of armes, and whan\nClaudas saugh hem come, he knewe hem wele be the baner that\nofte hadde hym greved in many dedes.  Than he seuered a part\nof his peple, and seide to Pounce Antonye and to ffrolle that\nthei sholde haue mynde to do well, and breke her enmyes; \"and\nI shall go a-geins hem that I se newe comen, and yef I may\ndo so moche that I may putte hem to flight, we shall delyuer\nvs wele of the surpluys; and I do yow to wite that it is the man that moste in this worlde hath me greved that hem doth\ngyde, and yef it myght so be that he were take or slayn, thei\nhadde loste oon of her beste membres.\"  With that departed the\nkynge Claudas with x Ml men of armes, and rode agein Pharien\nwith her sheldes be-fore her brestes, with  speres in fewtre and\nhelmes enclyned; and Pharien com ageins hem boldely as he\nthat was vigerouse, and of grete herte, and a wise werreour,\nand also a trewe knyght and moche of stature; and whan thei\napproched nygh thei lete renne to-geder as faste as horse\nmyght hem beren, and at that metynge were many throwe\nto the grounde that neuer roos after; but at grete myschef were\nthe peple of pharien; ffor Claudas hadde x Ml , and he hadde but\nv Ml ; but yet ther was stronge bataile, and sore fightinge; ffor\nPhariens men were newe comen, and Claudas men were\nsomewhat trauayled, so that thei loste more than dide Pharien, and\nyef thei hadde not be so many thei hadden alle be slain or\ndiscounfited; but in the ende Pharien be-houed to drawe bakke\ntowarde the foreste fro whens he was comen, and whan Claudas\nsaugh hem goinge he wende well all hadde ben venquysed, and\nkepte hem so short that thei hadde no power to recouer; and\nthat made Pharien so wo that ner he yede oute of witte, and\nhe cried, Gannes ofte, and many tymes the signe of kynge\nBohors; but it a-vayled nought, but the preised knyghtes wente\ngentilmanly, of whom he hadde plente; ffor thei a-bode with\nPharien be-hynde hem that fledden, and yaf many grete strokes\nthat oon for the tother, but in the fin were thei euell ledde,\ntill that leonce the lorde of Paerne hem socoured right\nvigerousely; and Claudas and his men were so anguysshous vpon\nhem that thei desired for to discounfite, that er thei wiste Leonce\nsmote in a-monge hem so harde that mo than a thousande he\nthrewe to grounde, that fewe of hem a-roos after, for many of\nhem were deth wounded, and than thei that fledde recouered\na-gein vigerously, as thei hadde not smyten no stroke of all the\nday.  Ther was the bataile crewell and mortall on bothe sides,\nand on that othir side full harde foughten the peple of the\nreame of longres a-gein the thre princes, and grete slaughter ther was on bothe parties; but sore were thei of the reame of logres\ndiscounfited, whan thei saugh not hem that sholde hem gouerne,\nand gyde, and yef ther hadde not ben many goode and worthy\nmen alle hadde thei be discounfited, and driven oute of the\nfelde; and Merlin that all this knewe wiste that thei were thus\nentirprised, he com thider as the kynge Ban, and the kynge\nBohors, and sir Gawein and his felowes were enbusshed, and\nto hem he seide, \"What, sirs, be ye come in to this countre to\nbe-holde the turmentis, and the prowesses of the knyghtes of\nthis cuntrey.  Now trewly ye be worthy to haue grete blame\nfor youre peple haue moche losse hadde seth ye wente from\nthe bataile, and sore thei ben affraide that thei may not yow\nseen ne here of no tidinges, and for goddes love loke youre\nsoiour be so dere to hem yolden that thei that ascape from\nyoure handes may sey that thei of the reame of logres be nother\nknaues ne harlottes, but worthi men and goode knyghtes; and\nye, sir,\" quod he to kynge Arthur and to kynge Bohors, \"is this\nthe werre and the helpe, that ye do to youre frendes that haue\nputte hem-self in a-uenture of deth for youre sake in many\na nede, as ye well knowe ther as alle other haue yow failed,\nand ye be come hider to hide yow for cowardise; and wite\nit well it shall be to yow grete reprof of moche peple, and\nof yowre love more than eny other, that is, of Gonnore, the\ndoughter of kynge Leodogon of Carmelide, whan she knoweth\nhow ye haue spedde.\" Whan the kynge vndirstode the worde of Merlin, he\nbowed down the heed for shame; but he spakke no\nworde er he hadde yoven a grete sigh, and he hadde grete\ndrede lest Merlin were toward hym wroth.  After that, Merlin\nyede to Gawein, and his felowes, and seide, \"Sirs, where be\nnow the grete prowesses that ye were wonte to atise oon to\nanother er ye were knyghtes, and than afterwarde ye seiden\nye wolde come turney with youre enmyes, and se how thei\ncowde bere armes; and now ye seyn hem goode knyghtes and\nsure, and for the drede that ye haue of hem be ye come hider\nyow to hiden, and ye ne haue nother herte ne hardynesse hem to a-bide.\"  And than he seide to kynge Ban and his\nbrother, \"And ye lordynges what be ye come to seche in this\ncontrey that sholde be wise and goode knyghtes and hardy; and\nwell ye haue it proved that men knewe well I-nough longe\ntyme past, but whi haue ye trowed these cowardes that ben\nhere that haue made yow here to hiden, whan ye sholde delyuer\nhem that for yow ben in a-venture of deth, for to helpe delyuer\nyoure londe of youre enmyes; ffor thei may well sey whan\nthei come in to her contrey, that thei haue be in sory seruise\nwhan ye haue hem lefte in her moste nede that thei hadde of\nyowe.\"  \"Trewly, sir,\" seide the kynge Ban, \"we ne did it\nbut for good.\"  Quod Merlin, \"How-so-euer ye do, euell\nhaue ye wrought, and therfore loke that the damage that\nthei yow haue don be right, dere I solde that thei that yow\nascape haue no cause for to a-vaunten.\"  \"Certes, sir,\" seide\nGawein, \"as for me, I knowe well I haue don right euell,\nnot for than I shall lete hem well wite that I am not hidde,\nyef in me be so moche valoure, though I sholde be deed or\nall to hewen, and er I departe that shall thei knowe bothe\nthe more and the lesse.

Whan Merlin hadde take the dragon out of Kayes hande he\nrode formeste vpon a blakke horse that was stronge and swyfte,\nand whan he approched nygh the bateile he drof in a-monge\nhem so harde, that alle thei fremysshed and brunt ther as\nPounce Antony faught, that sore hym peyned for to discounfite\nhem of Logres, and well he wende that alle the beste knyghtes\nhadde be slain, and therfore were thei full of hevynesse in the\ncastell of Tebres, and ronne to armes moo than xxvii squyers,\nand issed oute alle on horsbakke, and Banyns hem ledde that\nwas godsone to kynge Ban, and sone to Grascien of Trebes,\nand he was yet but xx ti yere of age, and was of grete\nhardynesse, and a-noon smyten in to the bataile and dide right well\nas of squyers for knyghtes were ther noon, and yef that thei\nhadde not come so soone the other were euen at discounfiture. Than com Merlin and his companye, that were mo than\na thousande, what oon and other, and he bar the dragon\nin his hande that yaf thourgh his throte so grete braundon of\nfier that the eir that was blakke of the duste and powder be\ncom all reade; and thei that neuer hadde it sein be-fore seide\nit shewde well that oure lorde was wroth with hem whan he\nmade soche a signe to a-pere, and than gan the chaunce to\nchaunge fro hem that hadde the better; ffor as soone as thei\nwere comen, thei dide soche maistries of armes, that alle were\na-basshed that weren hem a-geins, ffor ther dide the kynge\nArthur wondres, for he caste his shelde at his bakke, and hilde\nhis swerde in bothe hondes that was of grete bounte, and slough\nso many that noon myght a-gein hym endure; and the boke\nseith that he slough mo than two hundred, where-of was grete\nharme to cristin that ther were so many deed, and all that was for the reprof that Merlin hym yaf, and he hilde the\nreyne of his bridill in his lefte arme, and lete hym go ther\nas he wolde, and also the kynge Ban and the Bohors dide\nmerveiles; ffor sore thei hem peyned to be a-venged of her\nenmyes, and were goode knyghtes and hardy, and euer hadde\nbe a-bove alle the knyghtes that hadde I-ben in theire tyme. Now seith the booke that the kynge Arthur was so depe\npaste in to the bateile, that they wiste not where he\nwas be-come, and so was the kynge Ban and his brother, and\nwhan the knyghtes of the rounde table it wisten their gan\nmake soche a disray a-monge hem that noon a-bode other, and\nso dide the xl knyghtes that ye haue herde rehersed, and the\nxvij yonge knyghtes, and be-gonne so sharpe medle, eche for\nother, that noon wiste which wey that thei turned, and ofte\neche of hem loste other that day, and many tymes thei metten\nagein; at that returne dide Segramor wondres a-monge his enmyes,\nfor the storye seith that he was oon of the beste knyghtes of\nthe hoste; and so dide Galashin that often was he shewed, and\nmustred with the fynger on bothe sides, and so dide Ewein\nthat no man nede sech a beter knyght, and the thre brethern\nof Gawein that all day helde to-geder that for nothinge wolde\ndeparte, and wonderly well were thei preised; and on that other\nside foughten the knyghtes of the rounde table that noon\nmyght haue don better, and Adragain and Nascien and Hervy\nde revill made the renges to tremble ther as thei wente and\ncom; but ouer alle other dide sir Gawein well that was so\ndepe in a-monge his enmyes that noon cowde sey where he\nwas seth he from hem departed; and thei sought hym sore vp\nand down on euery side, and Gawein serched so the renges\nthat he mette Randolf the Senescall of Gaule, that a-noon he\nran vpon hym, for he was a goode knyght and hardy, and\nGawein hym smote in entirpassinge thourgh the helme to the\nsculle, and the horse bar hym forth and the suerde descended\non the horse chyne, and kutte it a-sonder, that bothe fill on\noon hepe; and than happed he mette Dodinell the sauage,\nand Kehedin the litill, in his wey that were smyten down of her horse, and Pounce Antony kepte hem right short, and whan\nGawein saugh hem at soche myschef he turned that wey, and\nmade soche stightlynge a-monge hem that alle dide resorte\nbakke wheder thei wolde or noon, and these lept lightly to\ntheire horse, ffor their fonde I-nowe in the place, and than thei\nhelde hem a-boute Gawein as longe as thei myght; but soone\nthei haue hym loste that thei ne wiste where he was be-come. Grete was the stour and harde bataile be-fore the castell\nof Trebes, for the knyghtes of the rounde table dide\nmaistres as thei yede sechinge the kynge Arthur thourgh the\nbateile, but thei cowde hym not fynde for he was so fer from\nhem meddelinge with ffrolle and Pounce Antony, that hadde\nin her companye vij C knyghtes of the beste of her hoste, and\nther the kynge Arthur hadde with hem sharpe medle; but\nnoon ne durste abide his strokes, and yet he was with-outen\nshelde, and he griped his suerde in bothe hondes, and whom\nthat he raught a full stroke was so harde smyten that noon\narmure was his warante fro deth, and whan Pounce Antony\nand ffrolle hym sien, a-noon thei ronne vpon hym, and he faught\nwith hem full harde, and many he slough and maymed a-boute\nhym, and than fill that Gawein com that way with suerde in\nhonde, and thei than fledde on euery side, for his strokes\ndurste not thei abide were thei neuer so hardy, and whan he\nsaugh Arthur, his oncle, that faught with Pounce and ffrolle,\nand with hem xx knyghtes, and ffrolle hadde hym smyten\nwith a spere be-twene the shuldres that he made hym to\nenclyne on his horse nekke, and yef the spere hadde holden\nhe hadde fallen to grounde; and whan Gawein saugh the stroke\nthat he hadde yoven his vncle he was ny wode for ire, than\nhe putte vp his suerde and spronge in a-monge the Almaynes,\nand raced a spere from a knyghtes hondes so felly that he\nfill to grounde, and ther-with rode to ffrolle, and whan he\nsaugh hym come he glenched for the stroke and girde in to\nthe thikkest presse, and Gawein hym chaced that lightly wolde\nnot hym leve; but ffrolles knyghtes smote be-twene hem two,\nbut Gawein hym smot so rudely thourgh the shelde and the hauberke a-gein the lifte shulder that the heed and the shafte\nshewed on that other side, and he swowned for peyne that\nhe felte, and his men assembled a-boute hym, and grete doell\nmade, for well thei wende he were deed delyuered. Whan ffrolle was vp of swownynge he made the tronchon\nto be pulde oute, and to bynde his wounde that sore\nbledde, and lept on his horse as well as he myght for sore it\nhym greved, and as soone as Gawein saugh hym falle he\nreturned to his vncle that full harde faught with Pounce Antony,\nand with the peple of Randolf, that was remounted; and\nRandolf peyned to a-venge the stroke that he hadde of\nGawein.  Ther-with com Gawein in a-monge hem, and smote a-boute\nhym on bothe sides, that he hath delyuered his vncle and\ndide soche maistres that noon durste his strokes a-bide, ne holde\nplace a-gein hem two; than fill that Gawein mette Pounce\nAntony, and hym soche a stroke on the sholder that the\nswerde kutte the boon, and in the ffalinge he hurte hym sore,\nand than he smote Randolf thourgh the helme in to the flesshe\nthat he fill to grounde all blody, that alle men wende he\nhadde ben deed; and that the batailes ruseden and were driven\nvpon the bataile of kynge Claudas that faught with leonce\nof Paerne and Pharien, and whan alle these baners and alle\nthese bateiles were assembled, thei smyte thourgh the bateile\nof Arthur alle entermedled; and ther than was grete harme\non bothe sides, ffor thei that fledden stynted at the bataile\nof Claudas, and whan Arthur saugh hem thus go he cleped\nGawein, and seide, \"feire nevew, holde yow a-boute me, ffor\nme semeth that thei be goynge, and therfore kepe yow with\nme.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Gawein, \"thei haue right to go, for the\nabidinge here for hem is not goode.  But lete vs go faste after\nand helpe thei were discounfited.\"  \"In all haste than,\" seide\nthe kynge; and while thei helde this talkynge, the Ban and the\nkynge Bohors com on with swerdes naked in her handes, all\nblody, and chaced and slough all that thei myght a-reche\nbefore hem; and of this happed well to Randolf and to Pounce,\nthat thei were horsed a-gein er the chace was be-gonne; and whan these foure frendes were mette thei made grete ioye,\nand than be-gan the chace after the other that fledden, and\nhem fill than a-uenture that thei mette thre of her folowes of\nthe rounde table that well hadde don all the day, and that oon\nwas Nascien, and that other Adragain, and the thridde hervy\nde Rivell, and than were thei vij full noble knyghtes and\nhardy; and it was past noone, and the sonne was high and\nhoot whan the chace be-gan, and kay fonde the kynges shelde\non the grounde liggynge, and he it saugh he hadde grete drede\nthat the kynge were deed, and made a squyer take the shelde,\nand badde hym folowe after hym, for he wolde loke yef he\ncowde finde kynge Arthur.

Grete was the bateile in the medowes be-fore Trebes ther\nas Claudas was vn-horsed, and remounted a-gein, and\nthan fill that her bateiles sparbled a-brode, and that oon smote\nin a-monge that other, and tho departed Pounce Antony, and\nffrolle the Duke of Almayne, and Randolf of Gaule, and the\nkynge Claudas so euyll araied, that vn-nethe myght thei ride,\nand the other were not alle in hele, and whan thei saugh the\nlosse and the damage vpon hem so grete thei were nygh wood\nfor anger, and asked what wey thei sholden goo.  \"Sirs,\"\nseide Claudas, \"I rede we go to the desert, for that is the\nbeste repeire that we haue; and the nexte, and we shull go\nby the foreste in the shadowe vndir molait, and olde wey that\nI knowe; but I am so euell a-raied that euell may I endure\nto ride,\" and while thei spake thus com alle the bateiles\nto-broken that oon vpon the tother.

THE DREAM OF THE WIFE OF KING BAN; THE DREAM OF JULIUS CESAR, EMPEROR OF ROME. Thus were the foure princes discounfited, as ye haue herde\nbe the witte of Merlin, and whan thei hadde chaced\nhem to the nyght, thei returned with grete plente of prisoners,\nand com be-fore the castell of Trebes, where thei were loigged in\ntentes and pavilouns of thiers that were discounfited, and made\ngrete ioye and feste all the nyght, for thei fonde the loigginges\nwell stuffed of all that neded to man, that nothinge failed, and\nwhan thei were herberowed that nyght wacched the hoste Pharien\nand Grascien, that thei were not assailled of somme maner peple,\nand the kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors ledde the kynge\nArthur and sir Gawein and the knyghtes of the rounde table,\nand the xl knyghtes that ye haue herde named, and the newe\nknyghtes in to the castell of Trebes where he made to hem\ngrete ioye and feste, and were well iijC knyghtes of the contrey;\nand that nyght were thei well serued of all that\nbe-hoved.  But who that was gladde or noon ther was noon like to the\nioye of the two queenes that were sustres, whan thei saugh\ntheire two lordes that thei hadde so longe desired for to seen,\nand thei were yonge ladyes, and of grete bewte; and gretly\nthei hem peyned to honour the kynge Arthur, and alle his\ncompanye, wher-to sholde I tarie to reherse theire seruise and\nthe ese of softe beddes that thei hadde that nyght, ffor thei\nwere serued richely as worthi men, and after soper thei wente\nto reste for ther-to hadde thei nede, ffor thei were wery for\ntrauaile that thei hadde that day suffred; and Arthur and\nGawein, and Segramor, and Ewein, and Dodinell, and Kay,\nand Antor lay in a feire chamber by hem-self, and with hem was Merlin that from hem that nyght wolde not departe;\nand the knyghtes of the rounde table, and the newe knyghtes,\nand the xl felowes layn in other chambers.  And whan the\nkynge Ban and the kynge Bohors hadde hem loigged at ese\nthei wente to bedde with their wiffes, and lefte grete torches\nbrennynge be-fore hem in chambres.  That nyght shewed the\ntwo kynges grete love to theire wiffes.  That nyght the queene\nHeleyne conceyved a childe by her lorde the kynge Ban, and\nwhan thei were on slepe the wiff of kynge Ban fill in to a\nmerveilouse drem that longe endured, that sore she was\na-feerde whan she dide a-wake, ffor she semed that she was on\na high mountayn, and saugh a-boute her grete plente of bestes\nof all maner kendes, that were in a feire pasture of grene grasse;\nand whan thei hadde longe tyme fedde hem on the herbes,\nther roos a-monge hem a grete noyse, that thei ronne that oon\nvpon the tother to dryve oute of the pasture, and thei turned\nin to two pastures; and the two partes wente on oon side and\nhem ledde a grete lyon full huge and merveillouse, and on\nthat other side where as were not so many by the haluendell\nwas a grete crowned lyon maister leder, but he was not so\ngrete as the tother.  This lyon crowned hadde in his companye\nxviij lyonsewes crowned, whereof eche of hem hadde lordshippe\nand domynacion ouer the tother bestes that were turned to\nthe lyon crowned; and that other lyon that was not crowned\nhadde with hym xxx ti lyonsewes that alle were crowned, whereof\neche of hem hadde domynacion of a parte of the bestes that\nwere drawe toward the lyon that was vncrowned, and whan\nthese beestes were thus disseuered and departed, she loked\ntoward the crowned lyon, and saugh iiij C boles that alle were\nteyed be the nekkes be-fore a grove, and ete at a rakke small\ngrasse and herbes that was newe mowen; and for the lyon\nvn-crowned semed thei hadde better pasture with the crowned\nlyon than hadde he, he ran upon hym for envye for to\nbereve hym his pasture, and toke a partie of his bestes that he\nmade thre grete hepes, and thei lepe to fight with the crowned\nlyon that hadde his bestes departed in to xviij mouncels, and in eche mouncell was a lyonsewe that hadde lordshippe ouer hem\nto gouerne hem and gide, and the iiij C boles that weren full\nfierce and full prowde and the xviij mouncels were with the\ncrowned lyon, and smote be-twene hem the grettest bateile that\nshe euer hadde seyn or herde speke; but in the fyn the bestes\nwith the crowned lyon be-houed to turne bakke, and the\ncrowned lyon was sore a-dredde to lese his pasture; and while\nthese beestes fought thus, as ye haue herde, the lady semed\nthat a grete leopart full fierce and the moste prowde that euer\nwas seyn, com oute of hir right thigh, and wente through\na grete valey that was right depe, and whan he was entred\nin to the valey, the lady semed that a grete blaste toke a-wey\nher sight that she wiste not where he was be-come; and whan\nshe hadde hym loste he turned toward the beestes that yet\nwere fightinge, and saugh that the crowned lyon and his bestes\nhadde moche the werse, and whan the leopart com oute of\na grete foreste that was sauage, he be-hilde the bataile of the\nbeestes full longe; and whan he saugh the crowned lyon hadde\nthe werse, he yede to helpe hym, and ran vpon the beestes\nof the lyon vn-crowned that faught with hem so fiercely, that\nhe made hem resorte bakke, and as longe as he was a-gein\nhem myght thei neuer haue the better of the bataile, and\nwhan the lyon that was vn-crowned saugh he myght not haue\nthe better while he was a-gein hym, he made departe the\nbataile and a-queynte hym with the leopart, till he drough hym\non his partye, and ledde hym with hym.  And the thridde\nday be-gan a-gein the bateile of the beestes as it hadde be\nby-forn, and the leopart was with the lyon that was\nvn-crowned; and the beestes fought so to-geder, that the crowned\nlyon turned to discounfiture, and he made signe to the lyon\nwith-oute crowne that he sholde go crye mercy, and he so\ndide, and so was made the pees be-twene the two lyouns in\nsoche maner that neuer after were in no wratthe to-geder; and\nthan the lady be-hilde the leopart to wite yef she cowde hym\nknowe be eny wey, and at the laste hir thought it was the\nsame that com oute of hir thigh that was so woxen and a-mended, and hir thought that alle the beestes of the bloy\nBreteyne to hym enclyned, and all thei of Gannes and of Benoyk,\nand whan he hadde alle the lordship of these beestes she knewe\nnot where he was be-comen. Thus she a-boode all nyght in this a-vision till it was day,\nand than she a-woke all affraied of the merveile of hir\ndreme; and when the kynge Ban saugh hir so affraied he asked\nhir what her eyled.  And she tolde hym hir dreme as she\nhadde seyn in hir slepe, and whan she hadde all tolde, the\nkynge seide ther-of sholde come but goode with goddes\ngrace.  Than thei a-roos and wente to the firste masse bothe the kynge\nand his wif as erly as thei myght; but thei wolde not a-wake\nthe kynge Arthur so erly, ne his companye that slepten sanourly\nfor the grete trauaile that thei hadde the day be-fore, and the\nkynge Ban praied oure lorde with goode herte that he wolde\nyeve hym the deth soche tyme as he wolde it aske.  And this\nprayour made he many tymes, till on a nyght in his slepe\na voyse seide that his  prayour sholde be trewe, and that he\nsholde haue the deth as soone as he wolde it aske the same\nday; but ones be-fore sholde he synne dedly in a-voutre er he\ndyed, but ther-of no to be dismayed, for he sholde ther-of well\na-corde with oure lorde, and he was right a goode man in his\nfeith and creaunce. In this dreme that the kynge Ban was, hym thought whan\nthe voyse departed that it caste soche a crye as it hadde\nben a thunder the grettest and merveillouse that euer he hadde\nherde, and he sprange ther-with so sore ther as he hilde the\nqueene in his armes, that nere he hadde fallen oute of the\nbedde that was grete and large; and the queene was ther-with\nso affraied that she myght speke no worde in a longe while,\nand the kynge hym-self so that he wiste not where he\nwas.  And whan the kynge was come a-gein in to his memorie, he\na-roos and wente to cherche and was shriven, and than herde\nthe servyse of oure lorde, and euer after as longe as he lyved\nwas he confessed euery viij dayes, and was hoseled with the\nblissed sacrement, and so dide the kynge Bohors, his brother, that was a full goode man, and of holy lyvinge.  Thus was\nthe kynge Arthur in the reame of Benoyk, he and his men\na moneth, and ronne euery day in to Claudas londes, and\nwasted it so that longe tyme after myght he haue no power\nto a-rise vpon the kynge Ban; but after he a-roos a-geins hym\nby the force of Pounce Antony, and by the force of the kynge\nof Gaule, as ye shull heren here-after, and turmented so these\ntwo brethern that he lefte hem noo foote londe, that thei died\nin pouerte vpon the grounde, and theire yonge wiffes lefte\nwith-oute comfort that after were nonnes veilled in the abbey\nof the royall mynster for drede of Claudas.  Ne neuer after\nmyght thei haue socour of the kynge Arthur, for he hadde so\nmoche to done in his contrey that he myght not come at that\ntyme, and so the heires that thei be-gat were longe tyme after\ndisherited.  But in the ende kynge Arthur hem ther-to restored,\nand drof Claudas oute of the londe, and yaf hem the reame of\nGaule, as the booke shall reherse.  But now we shall reste to\nspeke these thinges till tyme com ther-to and returne to telle\nhow Merlin departed from the kynge Arthur, and how he\ncertified the kynge Ban and his wif of dyuers dremes that\nthei hadden mette. Upon a day com the kynge Ban to Merlin, and seide, \"Sir,\nI am gretly in dispeir of a vision that is be-falle to\nme and to my wif, wherefore I haue grete nede of counseile;\nand ye be the wisest man that now liveth, and ther-fore yef\nit plese yow telle me what it be-tokeneth.\"  \"Certes, sir,\"\nseid Merlin, \"in these two a-visions there is grete significacion,\nand it is no wonder though ye thereof be dredfull.\"  Than\nasked the kynge Arthur what a-visiouns ben thei, and Merlin\nhym tolde euen as the kynge hadde mette in his dreme, that\nthe kynge hym-self knewe well he seide trouthe.  Whan the\nkynge Arthur and the kynge Bohors and sir Gawein herde the\nfierce wordes that Merlin hadde seide, thei merveiled sore what\nhit myght signyfie, and thoughten I-nough of many thinges,\nand than seide the kynge Arthur, \"ye haue tolde what were\nthe dremes.  Now, yef it plese yow, telle vs the be-tokenynges, for it is a thinge that I wolde fayn knowe.\"  \"Sir,\" seide\nMerlin, \"of all will I not to yow declare; ne I ought not to\ndo.  But I shall telle yow a partye that to yow apendeth,\" and than\nhe gan to sey, \"Kynge Ban,\" quod Merlin, \"hit is trouthe that the\nlyon that is not crowned be-tokeneth a prince that\nis right riche and mighty of londes, and of frendes that shall conquere xxix reames by force, and make come in his\ncompanye alle these xxix kynges crowned; and that other lyon that\nshe saugh I-crowned that hadde the xviij lyonsewes signyfieth\na kinge that is right myghty that shall have xviij kynges vnder\nhym, that alle shall be his liege men; and the iiij C booles that\nshe saugh be-tokeneth iiij C knyghtes, that alle shull be assured\nthat oon to the tother eche of hem to helpe, and not faile for\nno drede of deth, and alle shull thei be the kynges men, and\nthis prince that I spake of firste shall come vpon this kynge\nfor to conquere his londe.  But he shall hym diffende as longe\nas he may, and whan this prince hath the better of this kynge,\nthan shall come a knyght vn-knowen that longe hath be loste\nand helpe this kynge that the prince may not hym chace oute\nof the felde ne discounfite; and this leopart signyfieth this\nknyght, ffor like as the leopart fierce and prowde a-bove alle\nother bestes, so shall he be the beste knyght that shall be in\nhys tyme, and by that knyght shall the pees be made be-twene\nthe prince and the kynge that so sore shull haue\nfoughten.  Now,\" quod Merlin, \"haue ye herde your a-vision and the\ntokenynge, and now I moste departe for moche haue I to do in\nother places,\" and whan thei hadde I-herde the merveile of the\ndreme that Merlin hadde tolde, thei were more a-baisshed and\nmore pensef than thei were be-fore; and than Arthur asked yef\nhe wolde declare eny othir wise to theire vndirstondinge, and\nhe seide, \"Nay.\" With that departed Merlin oute of the kynge Bans house,\nwhere-as the kynge Arthur was with grete companye\nof knyghtes, and this was on the feeste of seynt John; and Merlin\nwente to his love that a-boode hym at the welle, for to holde the couenaunt that she hadde with hym I-made, and whan she\nhym saugh she made to hym grete chere, and ledde hym in to\nthe chambres so prively that he was not a-perceyved of no man;\nand she asked and enquered hym of many thinges, and he her\ntaught all her askynge for the grete love that he hadde to\nhir; and whan she saugh he loved hir so wele, she asked hym\nhow she myght make a frende for to slepe and not to a-wake\ntill that she wolde, and Merlin knewe well all hir thought, and\nneuertheles he asked her whi she enquered and ye he wiste it\nwele I-nough.  Quod she, \"for I wolde make my fader a-slepe\nalle the tymes that I wolde speke with yow, whos name is\nDionas, and my moder, that thei aparceyve neuer of yow ne me,\nffor witeth it well thei wolden me sle yef thei parceyved of vs\ntwo ought.\"  These wordes seide the mayden ofte to Merlin,\nand it fill on a day that thei were in a gardin by the fountayne\nhem to disporte, and were sette vpon an ympe, and the mayden\nmade hym to slepe in hir lappe, and hilde her so with hym\nthat Merlyn loved hir merveillously wele.  Than the maiden\nrequired hym so that he taught hir to make oon slepe, and he\nknewe hir menynge right wele; but neuertheles he it hir taugght,\nbothe that and many other thinges ffor so wolde oure lorde; and\nhe taught hir iij names that she wrote for to helpe hir-self at\nalle tymes whan she sholde with hym ly, that were full of grete\nforce, ffor neuer as longe as thei were vpon hir, ne myght neuer\nman touche her flessly; and fro thens-forth she tysed euer Merlin\nto come speke with hir, for he ne hadde no power to dele with\nhir a-gein her will, and ther-fore it is seide that woman hath\nan art more than the deuell.  Thus Merlin a-bode viij dayes\nfull with the damesell; but we fynde not in no writinge that\neuer he required eny vilonye of hir ne of noon other; but she\nit douted sore whan she knewe what he was, and ther-fore she\ngarnysshed hire so a-gein hym; and in tho viij dayes he taught\nhir many wonderfull thinges that eny mortall herte cowde\nthinke of, thinges paste and of thinges that were don and seide,\nand a partye of that was to come; and she putte hem in\nwritinge, and than Merlin departed from hire and com to Benoyk, where the kynge Arthur rested, that gladde were whan\nthei saugh Merlin. After that Merlin was repeired fro Benoyk as ye haue herde,\nGawein with a grete companye of knyghtes and men\nof armes rode in to Claudas londes, and brake the bourghes and\ntownes, and sette fire all a-boute, that alle the mene peple fledde\nthe contrey, and these ronne be-fore the yates of de la desert and\ndistroyed alle that thei myght fynde, and Claudas ne noon of\nhys companye ne durste not meve, and than departed from\nClaudas, Pounce Antonye, and ffrolle of Almayne, and Randolf\nthe senescall of Gaule sory and wroth for the losse and damage\nthat thei hadden, and swore that neuer sholde thei love the\nkynge Ban; and as soone as thei myght be a-venged thei sholde\nyelde hym his guerdon as for soche seruise.  But some weneth\nto a-venge hym of his shame, and he doth it encrece.  Thus\nlefte Claudas pore in the Citee de la desert, ffor he cowde not\nhaue iij Ml men on horsbak, but after he recouerd all his londe\nand was riche, as the storye shall declare here-after, be the\nhelpe of the kynge of Gaule and of Pounce Antonye, that\nrepeired from Rome with grete power; but it was in euell\nhour, for he was slayn by the handes of kynge Ban be-fore\nTrebes.  But Claudas hadde so moche peple that he leide sege\nbe-fore the Castell as ye shull here afterward, whan tyme\ncometh ther-to. Whan Gawein and his companye hadde wasted the londe\nand the contrey, and taken alle the richesse, he\nreturned to Benoyk to his vncle; and Merlin was come from his\nlove and boode after Gawein, and whan he was come thei were\ngladde whan thei hym syen, and for the grete richesse that thei\nbroughten, and ioyfull weren of the victorie that thei hadden;\nand on the morowen thei toke theire wey towarde Gannes, a\nCitee plentevouse of all goodes, and ther thei were right well\ncome, for it was right, and the kynge Bohors peyned hym to do\nhem honour and well to serue, as he that full well cowde it do;\nand ther thei soiourned two dayes, and the thridde day thei\nrode forth to the Rochell, and ther entred the see.  Whan the kynge Arthur, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and\nsir Gawein sholde entre in to the shippes thei toke Merlin in\ncounseile, and Merlin hem comaunded that as soone as thei were\na-rived at the porte, in no wise that thei tarye not but two\ndayes.  But hastely go theire wey in to the reame of Carmelide,\nand lede with hem but thre thousande men of armes, and that\nthei be chosen of the beste of the hoste.  \"Ffeire frende,\" quod\nArthur, \"shull ye not come with vs; thenke ye not to be at\noure mariage.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Merlin, \"I haue a thinge for to\ndo that I moste nede performe er I come in to the bloy\nBreteyne.  But ye shull but litill space be in the reame of Carmelide, er\nI shall be with yow;\" with that departed that oon from that\nother, and Arthur and hys companye wente towarde the see, but\nther-of moste we reste a-while, and speke of Merlin and his\nauenturis. As soone as Merlin was departed from Arthur, he wente\nin to the forestes of Rome that were thikke and depe,\nand in that tyme Julyus Cesar was Emperour; but it was not\nthat Julyus Cesar that the deed knyght slough in his pavilion\nof Perce.  But it was that Julius that Gawein, the nevew of\nkynge Arthur, slough in bateile vnder logres at the grete\ndisconfiture that after was be-twene hym and the kynge Arthur\nthat hym diffied, and what the cause was that Merlin wente\nthat wey, it is reson it be declared.  This is throuthe that this\nJulyus cezar hadde a wif that was of grete bewte, and she hadde\nwith hir xij yonge men araied in gise of wymen, with whom\nshe lay at alle tymes that the Emperour was oute of hir\ncompanye, ffor she was the most lecherouse woman of all Rome;\nand for the dredde that theire beerdes sholde growe she lete\na-noynte her chynnes with certeyn oynementes made for the\nnones, and thei were clothed in longe traylinge robes, and theire\nheer longe waxen, in gise of maydenes and tressed at theire\nbakkes, that alle that hem saugh wende wele thei were wymen;\nand longe thei endured with the Empresse vn-knowen.  In this tyme that the Emperesse ledde this lif, it fill that a mayden\ncom to the Emperours court that was the doughter of a prince,\nand the name of this prince was matan, Duke of Almayne; this\nmayden com in semblannce of a squyer, and this matan the\nDuke ffrolle hadde disherited and driven out of his londe, and\nshe com to serue the Emperour, ffor she wiste not where her\nfader ne moder were be comen, and she was moche and semly,\nand well shapen and demened hir well in all maners that a man\nought, saf only eny vylonye, and neuer was she knowen but for\na man by no semblante, and so a-boode with the Emperour, and\nwas of grete prowesse, and peyned tendirly to serue well the\nEmperour and plesed hym so well that she was lorde and gouernour\nof hym and his housolde; and the Emperour hir loved so well that\nhe made hir knyght atte a feeste of seint John with other yonge squyers, wher-of were mo than CC, and after made hir stiward\nof all his londe.  Than the newe knyghtes reised a quyntayne\nin the mede of noiron, and be-gonne the bourdinge grete and\nhuge, and many ther were that dide right wele, but noon so\nwell as dide Grisandoll, for so she lete hir be cleped; but in\nbapteme her name was Anable.  This bourdinge endured all day\non ende till euesonge that thei departed, and Grisandols bar\na-wey the pris a-monge alle other, and whan the Emperour saugh\nGrisandoll of so grete prowesse, he made hym stiward of all his\nlonde and comaunder a-bove alle that ther weren, and Grisandols\nwas well beloved of riche and pore.  And vpon a nyght after it\nfill that the Emperour lay in his chamber with the Emperesse;\nand whan he was a-slepe he hadde a vision that hym thought\nhe saugh a sowe in his court that was right grete be-fore his\npaleys, and he hadde neuer seyn noon so grete ne so huge, and\nshe hadde so grete bristelis on her bakke that it trayled on the\ngrounde a fadome large, and hadde vpon hir heed a cercle that\nsemed of fyn golde, and whan the Emperour a-vised hym wele\nhym thought that he hadde seyn hir other tymes, and that he\nhadde hir norisshed vp; but he durste not sey of trouthe that\nshe were hys, and while he entended to a-vise hym on this\nthinge he saugh come oute of his chamber xij lyonsewes, and com in to the courte to the sowe, and assailed hir oon after\na-nother, whan the Emperour saugh this merveile he asked his\nBarouns what sholde he do with this sowe by whom these\nlyonsewes hadde thus leyn, and thei seide she was not worthi to be\nconuersaunt a-monge peple, ne that no man sholde ete nothinge\nthat of hir come, and Iuged hir to be brente, and also the\nlyonsewes to-geder; and than a-wooke the Emperour sore affraied\nand pensif of this a-vision.  Ne neuer to man ne to wif wolde\nhe it telle, for he was full of grete wisdom.  On the morowe as\nsoone as he myght se the day, he a-roos and yede to the mynster\nto here messe, and whan he was come a-gein he fonde the barouns\nassembled, and hadde herde messe at the mynster and the\nmete was all redy; and whan thei hadde waisshen thei satte to\nmete, and were well serued.  Than fill that the Emperour fill\nin to a grete stodye, wher-fore all the courte was pensif and\nstille, and ther was noon that durste sey a worde for sore thei\ndredde for to wrathe the Emperour.  But now we moste turne\na litill to Merlin that was come in to the foreste of Romayne\nto certefie these thinges and these a-visiouns. While that the Emperour satte at his mete a-monge his\nBarouns thus pensif, Merlin come in to the entre of\nRome and caste an enchauntement merveilouse, ffor he be-com\nan herte the gretteste and the moste merveilouse that eny man\nhadde seyn, and hadde oon of his feet be-fore white, and hadde\nv braunches in the top, the grettest that euer hadde be seyn,\nand than he ran thourgh Rome so faste as all the worlde hadde\nhym chaced, and whan the peple saugh hym so renne, and\nsaugh how it was an herte the noyse a-roos, and the cry on\nalle partyes, and ronne after grete and small with staves and\naxes, and other wepen, and chaced hym thourgh the town, and\nhe com to the maister gate of the paleys where-as the Emperour\nsatte at his mete, and whan thei that serued herde the noyse\nof the peple, thei ronne to the wyndowes to herkene what it\nmyght be, and a-noon thei saugh come rennynge the herte and\nall the peple after; and whan the herte com to the maister paleys\nhe drof in at the yate sodeynly, and than he ran thourgh the tables a bandon and tombled mete and drynke all on an hepe,\nand be-gan ther-in a grete trouble of pottis and disshes; and\nwhan the herte hadde longe turned ther-ynne he com be-fore the\nEmperour, and kneled and seide, \"Julius cezar, Emperour of\nRome, wheron thinkest thow, lete be thi stodyinge for it\na-vaileth nought, ffor neuer of thyne a-vision shalt thow not\nknowe the trouthe be-fore that man that is sauage the certefie,\nand for nought is it that thow stodyest ther-on eny more.\"\nThan the herte hym dressed and saugh the yate of the paleyse\ncloos, and he caste his enchauntement that alle the dores and\nyates of the paleise opened so rudely that thei fly alle in peces,\nand the herte lept oute and fledde thourgh the town, and the\nchace be-gan a-gein after hym longe till that he com oute in\nto the playn feeldes; and than he dide vanysshe that noon sey\nwhere he be-com, and than thei returned a-gein, and whan the\nEmperour wiste the herte was ascaped he was wroth and lete\ncrye thourgh the londe that who that myght brynge the sauage\nman or the herte sholde haue his feire doughter to wif, and half\nhis reame, yef that he were gentill of birthe, and after his deth\nhaue all; and lepe to horse many a vailaunt knyght and squyer\nof pris, and serched and sought thourgh many contrees, but all\nwas for nought, ffor neuer cowde thei heere no tidinges of that\nthei sought, and whan thei myght no more do thei returned\na-gein.  But euer Grisandols serched thourgh the forestes, oon\nhour foreward, another bakke that so endured viij dayes full;\nand on a day as Grisandol was a-light vnder an oke for to praye\noure lorde to helpe and to spede for to fynde that he sought, and\nas he was in his prayours the herte that hadde ben at Rome\ncom be-fore hym and seide, \"Auenable, thow chacest folye,\nffor thow maist not spede of thy queste in no maner, but I shall\ntelle the what thow shalt do.  Purchese flessh newe and salt,\nand mylke and hony, and hoot breed newe bake, and bringe\nwith the foure felowes, and a boy to turne the spite till it be\nI-nough rosted, and com in to this foreste by the moste vn-couthe\nweyes that thow canste fynde, and sette a table by the fier,\nand the breed, and the mylke, and the hony vpon the table, and hide the and thi companye a litile thens, and doute the\nnought that the sauage man will come.\" Than ran the herte a-grete walope thourgh the foreste, and\nGrisandol lept to horse and thought well on that the\nherte hadde seide and thought in his corage that it was somme\nspirituell thinge that by hir right name hadde hir cleped, and\nthought well that of this thinge sholde come some merveile;\nand Grisandol rode forth to a town nygh the foreste vij myle,\nand toke ther that was myster, and com in to the foreste ther\nas he hadde spoke with the herte as soone as he myght, and\nroode in to the deepe of the foreste, where-as he fonde a grett\noke full of leves, and the place semed delitable, and he a-light\nand sette theire horse fer thens, and made a grete fier, and sette\nthe flesshe to roste, and the smoke and the sauour spredde\nthourgh the foreste, that oon myght fele the sauour right fer;\nand than sette the table be the fier, and whan all was redy thei\nhidde hem in a bussh.  And Merlin that all this knewe and that\nmade all this to be don couertly that he were not knowen drough\nthat wey that he were not knowen with a grete staffe in his nekke\nsmytinge grete strokes from oke to oke, and was blakke and\nrough for rympled and longe berde, and bar-foote, and clothed\nin a rough pilche; and so he com to the fier, ther as the flessh\nwas rosted, and whan the boy saugh hym come he was so a-ferde\nthat he fledde nygh oute of his witte; and he this com to the\nfier and be-gan to chacche and frote a-boute the fier, and saugh\nthe mete and than loked all a-boute hym and be-gan to rore\nlowde as a man wood oute of mynde, and than be-heilde, and\nsaugh the cloth spredde and soche mete ther-on as ye haue\nherde, and after he be-heilde towarde the fier, and saugh the\nflesshe that the knaue hadde rosted that was tho I-nough, and\nraced it of with his hondes madly, and rente it a-sonder in peces,\nand wette it in mylke, and after in the hony, and ete as a wood\nman that nought ther lefte of the flessh; and than he eete of the\nhoot breed and hony that he was full and swollen grete, and\nsomwhat was it colde, and he lay down by the fier and slepte;\nand whan Grisandol saugh he was on slepe she and hir felowes com as softely as thei myght, and stale a-wey his staffe, and\nthan thei bounde hym with a cheyne of Iren streytely a-boute\nthe flankes, and than delyuered hym to oon of the companye by\nthe tother ende of the cheyne; and whan he was so well bounde\nhe a-wooke and lept vp lightly, and made semblaunt to take his\nstaff as a wilde man, and Grisandolus griped hym in his armes\nright sore and hilde hym stille, and whan he saugh hym so\nbounde and taken, he hilde hym as shamefaste and mate; and\nthan the horse were brought forth and he was sette vpon oon\nof hem, and bounden to the sadell with two bondes, and a man\nsette be-hynde hym that was bounde to hym and enbraced hym\nby the myddill, and so thei rode forth her wey, and the sauage\nman loked on Grisandolus that rode by hym, and be-gan to\nlaugh right harde, and whan Grisandolus saugh hym laughe he\napproched ner and rode side by side, and a-queynted with hym\nthe beste that he myght, and enquered and asked many thinges,\nbut he ne wolde nought ansuere, and Grisandol asked why he\nlough, but he wolde not telle.  Saf that he seide, \"Creature\nformed of nature chaunged in to other forme fro hens-forth\nbe-gilynge alle thinges venimouse as serpent , holde thi pees, for\nnought will I telle the till that I com be-fore the Emperoure.\" With that the sauage man hilde his pees and spake no\nmore, and rode forth to-geder, and Grisandolus of\nthis that he hadde seide spake to his companye, and thei seide\nthat he was wiser than he shewed, and that som grete merveile\nsholde falle in the londe.  Thus thei ride spekynge of many\nthinges till thei passede be-fore an abbey, and saugh be-fore the\nyate moche pore peple a-bidinge almesse, and than the sauage\nman lowgh right lowde; and than Grisandol com toward hym\nand swetly praide hym to telle wherefore he lough, and he loked\nproudly on trauerse, and seide, \"Ymage repaired and disnatured\nfro kynde, holde thy pees, ne enquere no mo thinges for nought\nwill I telle the but be-fore the Emperour;\" and whan Grisandolus\nthis vndirstde, he lete hym be at that tyme and no more thinge\nhym asked, and here-of spake thei in many maners.  Thus thei\nride forth all day till nyght, and on the morowe till the hour of prime, and fill that thei passed by-fore a chapell where a preste\nwas toward masse, and fonde a knyght and a squyer heringe the\nseruyse; and whan Grisandolus saugh this, thei a-light alle the\ncompanye, and entred in to here the masse, and whan the\nknyght that was in the chapell saugh the man bounde with\nchaynes he hadde merveile what it myght be, and while the\nknyght be-heilde the man that was sauage, the squyer that was\nin an angle be-hynde the chapel dore come a-gein his lorde, and\nlifte vp his hande and yaf hym soche a flap that alle thei in the\nchapell myght it here, and than returned thider as he com fro\nall shamefaste of that he hadde don, and whan he was come in\nto his place he ne rofte no-thinge, for the shame lasted no lenger;\nbut while he was in returnynge, and whan the sauage man\nsaugh this, he be-gan to laugh right harde, and the knyght that\nwas so smyten was so a-baisshed that he wiste not what to sey\nbut suffred; and Grisandolus and the other companye merveiled\nsore what it myght be.  A-noon after the squyer com a-gein to\nhis lorde, and yaf hym soche a-nother stroke as he dide be-fore,\nand wente a-gein in to his place, and the sauage man hym\nbe-hilde and be-gan to laughe right harde, and yef the knyght\nbe-fore were a-baisshed, he was than moche more, and the\nsquyer that hadde hym smyten returned sorowfull and pensif to\nthe place that he com fro, and hilde hym-self foule disceyved of\nthat he hadde don, and whan he was in his place he rought\nneuer, and Grisandolus, and the companye merveiled right sore,\nand herden oute the seruise be leyser, and in the mene while that\nthei thoughten vpon these thinges that thei hadde seyn, the\nsquyer com the thridde tyme and smote his lorde sorer than he\nhadde don be-fore, and ther-at lowgh the wilde man sore, and\nbe that was the masse at an ende, and than Grisandolus and\nalle wente oute of the chapell, and the squyer that hadde\nsmyten his lorde com after and asked Grisandolus what man it\nwas that thei hadde so bounde, and thei seide that thei were\nwith Julius cezar, Emperour of Rome, and ledde to hym that\nsauage man that thei hadde founded in the foreste, for to\ncertefie of a vision that was shewed hym slepinge.  \"But, sir,\" seide Grisandolus, \"tell me wherefore hath this squyer yow\nsmyten thre tymes, and ye ne spake no worde a-gein, haue ye\nsoche a custome,\" and the knyght ansuerde that he sholde it\nwite in tyme comynge. Than the knyght cleped his squyer and asked hym be-fore\nGrisandolus wherefore he hadde hym smyten, and he\nwas shamefaste, and seide he wiste neuer, but so it fill in his\ncorage, and the knyght hym asked yef he hadde now eny talent\nhym for to smyte, and the squyer seide he hadde leuer be deed,\n\"but that,\" quod he, \"it fill in my mynde that I myght not kepe\nme ther-fro,\" and Grisandolus lough of the merveile.  Than seide\nthe knyght that he wolde go to court with hem for to here what\nthe sauage man wolde sey, and with that thei rode forth on her\nwey, and Grisandolus by the sauage mannes side, and whan thei\nhadde a-while riden, he asked the wilde man wherfore he lough\nso thre tymes whan the squyer smote his lorde, and he loked on\nhir a trauerse, and seide, \"Ymage repeyred semblaunce of\ncreature wherby men ben slayn and diffouled rasour trenchaunt\nffountayne coraunt that neuer is full of no springes holde thy pees,\nand nothinge of me enquere, but be-fore the Emperour, for nought\nwill I telle the,\" and whan that Grisandolus vndirstode the\nfell wordes that he spake, he was all a-baisshed and pensef,\nand durste not no more enquere, and rode forth till thei come\nto Rome, and whan thei entred in to the town, and the peple\nhem parceyved thei wente all a-geins hym for to se the man that\nwas sauage, and the noyse was grete of the peple that folowed,\nand be-hilde his facion as longe as thei myght, and so thei\nconveyed hym to the paleise, and whan the Emperour herde the\ntidinges he com hem a-geins, and mette with hem comynge vpon\nthe greces, and than com Grisandolus be-fore the Emperour, and\nseide, \"Sir, haue here the man that is sauage that I to yow\nhere yelde, and kepe ye hym fro hens-forth for moche peyne haue\nI hadde with hym,\" and the Emperour seide he wolde hem well\nguerdon, and the man sholde be well kepte, and than he sente\nto seche a smyth to bynde hym in chaynes and feteres, and the\nsauage man badde hym ther-of not to entermete, \"ffor wite it right well,\" quod he, \"I will not go with-oute youre leve,\" and\nthe Emperour hym asked how he ther-of sholde be sure, and\nhe seide he wolde hym asure by his cristyndome.  Quod the\nEmperour, \"Art thow than cristin?\"  and he seide, \"Ye\nwithoute faile.\"  \"How were thow than baptized,\" seide the\nEmperour, \"whan thow art so wilde.\"  \"That shall I telle\nyow,\" quod he, \"This is the trouthe that my moder on a day\ncom from the market of a town, and it was late whan she entred\nin to the foreste of brocheland, and wente oute her way so fer\nthat the same nyght be-hoved hir to lye in the foreste, and\nwhan she saugh she was so a-lone be hir-self she was a-feerde and lay down vnder an oke and fill a-slepe, and than com\na sauage man oute of the foreste and by hir lay, be-cause she\nwas sool by hir-self.  Durste she not hym diffende, ffor a woman\na-loone is feerfull, and that nyght was I be-geten on my moder,\nand whan she was repeired hom, she was full pensif longe tyme,\ntill that she knewe verily that she was with childe, and bar\nme so till I was born in to this worlde and was baptised in\na fonte, and dide me norishe till I was grete, and as soone as\nI cowde lyve with-outen hir, I wente in to the grete forestes\nfor by the nature of my fader be-houeth me thider to repeire,\nand for that he was sauage I am thus wilde.

On the fourthe day after the sauage man was comen, where\nthat the lordes were assembled in the maister paleise, and\nthe Emperour brought in this sauage man and made hym to\nsitte down by hym, and whan the barouns hadde I-nough hym\nbeholden thei asked why he hadde for hem sente, and he tolde hem\nfor a vision that hym be-fill in his slepynge, \"ffor I will that it\nbe expowned be-fore yow,\" and thei seide that the significacion\nwolde thei gladly heren.  Than the Emperour comaunded this\nman to telle the cause why that he was sought, and he ansuerde\nand seide that he wolde nothinge telle till that the Emperesse\nand hir xij maydones were comen, and she com a-noon with\ngladde semblaunce as she that yaf no force of nothinge that\nmyght be-falle, whan the Emperesse and hir xij maydones were\ncome a-monge the barouns, the lordes roos a-gein hir and dide\nhir reuerence, and as soone as the sauage man hir saugh\ncomynge he turned his heed in trauerse and be-gan to laughe\nas in scorne, and whan he hadde a-while laughed he loked on\nthe Emperour stadfastly, and than on Grisandolus, and than on\nthe Emperesse, and than on hir xij Maydenys that weren with\nhir, and than he turned toward the barouns, and be-gan to\nlaughe right lowde as it were in dispite, whan the Emperour\nsaugh hym so laughe he preied hym to telle that he hadde in\ncouenaunt, and whi that he lough now and other tymes, with\nthat he stode vp and seide to the Emperour so lowde that all\nmyght it heren.  \"Sir, yef ye me graunte as trewe Emperour\nbe-fore youre barouns that ben here that I shall not be the werse\nne no harme to me therfore shall come, and that ye will yeve\nme leve as soone as I haue yow certefied of youre a-vision I\nshall telle yow the trewe significacion,\" and the Emperour hym\nansuerde and graunted that noon harme ne annoye to hym sholde\nbe don, ne that he sholde come hym no magre to telle hym that\nhe was so desirouse for to heren, and that he sholde haue leve\nto go whan hym liste.  \"But I praye the telle me myn a-vision in audience of alle my barouns what it was, and than shall I the\nbetter be-leve the significacion whan thow haste me tolde, of\nthat I neuer spake to no creature,\" and he ansuerde as for that\nsholde hym not greve, and ther-fore wolde he not lette and\nthan he be-gan the a-vision. \"Sir,\" seide the sauage man to the Emperour, \"it fill on\na nyght that ye lay by youre wif that is here, and\nwhan ye were a-slepe ye thought ye saugh be-fore yow a sowe\nthat was feire and smothe, and the heer that she hadde on her\nbakke was so longe that it trailed to grounde more than a\nfadome, and on hir heed she hadde a cercle of goolde bright\nshynynge, and yow semed that ye hadde norisshed that sowe\nin youre house, but ye cowde it not verily knowe, and ther-with\nyow semed that ye hadde hir othir tymes sein, and whan ye\nhadde longe thought on this thinge ye saugh come oute of youre\nchamber xij lyonsewes full feire and smothe; and thei com by\nthe halle thourgh the courte to the sowe and lay by hir oon\nafter a-nother, and whan thei hadde do that thei wolde thei\nwente a-gein in to youre chamber; than com ye to youre barouns\nand hem asked what sholde be do with this sowe, that ye saugh\nthus demened, and the barouns and alle the peple seide she was\nnothinge trewe, and thei Iuged to be brent, bothe the sowe and\nthe xij lyonsewes, and than was the fier made redy grete and\nmerveillouse in this courte, and ther-ynne was the sowe brente\nand the xij lyonsewes.

Thus toke Emperour vengaunce of his wif, and\ngrete was the renomede that peple of hym spake whan it\nwas knowen. Whan the Emperesse was brente, and thei that she hadde\nmade hir maydenes, the barouns returned a-gein to the\nEmperour, and seide oon to a-nother that the sauage man was\nright wise and avisee, ffor yet shall he sey some other thinges\nwher-of shall come some grete merveile vs, and to all the worlde;\nand the Emperour hym-self seide that he hadde seide his a-vision\nas it was in trouthe.  Thus wiste the Emperour the lyvinge of\nhis wif, and than the Emperour hym called, and asked yef he\nwolde sey eny more, and he seide, \"Ye yef he asked hym\nwhereof.\"  \"I wolde wite,\" quod he, \"wherefore thow didist\nlaughe whan thow were in the foreste , and loked on Grisandolus,\nand also whan thow were ledde be-fore an abbey, and in the\nchapell whan the squyer smote his lorde, and why thow seidest\ntho wordes to my stiwarde whan he asked why thow loughe,\nand after tell me what be-tokeneth the laughter here-ynne\nwhan thow saugh the Emperesse come.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the\nsauage man, \"I shall telle yow I-nowgh.  I do yow to wite that\nthe firste laughter that I made was for that a woman hadde me\ntaken by her engyn, that no man cowde not do; and wite ye well\nthat Grisandolus is the beste maiden and the trewest with-ynne\nyoure reame, and therefore was it that I lough; and the laughter\nthat I made be-fore the abbey, was for ther is vnder erthe\nbe-fore the yate the grettest tresour hidde that eny man knoweth,\nand therfore I lough for that it was vnder feet of hem that\na-boode after the almesse, ffor more richesse is in that tresour\nthan alle the monkes beth worth, and all the abbey, and all that\nther-to be-longeth, and the pore peple that ther-on stoden cowde\nit not take; and Avenable youre stywarde, that Grisandolus doth\nher clepen, saugh that I lowgh and asked me wherefore, and\nthe couerte wordes that I to hir spake was for that she was\nchaunged in to the fourme of man, and hadde take a-nothir\nhabite than hir owne; and alle the wordes that I spake thei ben\ntrewe, ffor by woman is many a man disceyved, and therefore\nI cleped hir disceyaunt for by women ben many townes sonken\nand brent, and many a riche londe wasted and exiled, and moche\npeple slayn; but I sey it not for noon euell that is in hir, and thow thy-self maist well perceyve that be women be many\nworthi men shamed and wratthed that longe haue loued to-geder,\nyef it were not for debate of women; but now rech the not for\nthy wif, that thou haste distroied, ffor she hath it well deserued,\nand haue therfore no mystrust to other, for as longe as the\nworlde endureth it doth but apeire, and all that cometh to hem\nbe the grete synne of luxure that in hem is closeth; ffor woman\nis of that nature, and of that disire, that whan she hath the\nmoste worthi man of the worlde to hir lorde, she weneth she\nhaue the werste, and wite ye fro whens his cometh of the grete\nfragelite that is in hem; and the foule corage and the foule\nthought that thei haue where thei may beste hir volunte\nacomplish; but therfore be not wroth, for ther ben in the worlde\nthat ben full trewe, and yef thow haue be desceyved of thyn,\nyet shall thow haue soche oon that is worthy to be Emperesse,\nand to resceyve that high dignite, and yef thow wilt it be-leve\nthow shalt wynne ther-on more than thowe shalt lese.  But the\nprophesie seith that the grete dragon shall come fro Rome that\nwolde distroie the reame of the grete Breteyne and put it in his\nsubieccion; and the fierce lyon crowned maugre the diffence of\nthe turtill that the dragon hath norisshed vndir his wynges, and\nas soone as the grete dragon shall meve to go to the grete\nBreteigne, the lyon crowned shall come hym a-geins, and shull\nfight so to-geder, that a fierce bole that is prowde, whiche the\nlyon shall bringe with hym shall smyte so the dragon with oon\nof his hornes that he shall falle down deed, and therby shall be\ndelyuered the grete lyon.  But I will not telle the significacion\nof these wordes, for I owe it nought to do, but all this shall falle\nin thy tyme, and therfore be well ware of euell counseile, for\ngrete part longeth to the.  The tother laughter that I made in\nthe chapell was not for the buffetes that the squyer yaf his\nlorde, but for the be-tokenynges that ther-ynne ben.  In the\nsame place ther the squyer stode was entred, and yet ther is\nvndir his feet a merveillouse tresour.  The firste buffet that the\nsquyer yaf his lorde signifieth that for avoure the worlde becometh so prowde, that he douteth nother god ne his soule, no more than the squyer douted to smyte his maister, but the riche\nwolde oppresse the pore vnder theire feet; and that make these\nvntrewe riche peple whan enythinge cometh to hem be\nmyschaunce thei swere and stare and sey maugre haue god for\nhis yeftes, and wite ye what maketh this nothinge but pride of\nrichesse.  The seconde buffet be-tokeneth the riche vserer that\ndeliteth in his richesse and goth scornynge his pore nyghebours\nthat be nedy whan thei come to hym ought for to borough, and\nthe vserer so leneth hem litill and litill that at laste thei moste\nselle theire heritage to hym that so longe hath it coveyted.  The\nthridde buffet signifieth these false pletours, men of lawe, that\nsellen and a-peire theire neyghbours be-hinde here bakke for\ncouetise and envye of that thei se hem thrive, and for thei be not\nin her daungier, ffor whan these laweers sen that her neighbours\ndon hem not grete reverence and servise, thei thenken and\na-spien how thei may hem a-noyen in eny wise, and to make\nhem lese that thei haue, and therfore men seyn an olde sawe,\nwho hath a goode neighbour hath goode morowe.  Now haue ye\nherde the significaciouns why the buffetes were yoven, but the\nsquyer delited nothinge ther-ynne whan that he smote his\nmaister, but he wiste not fro whens this corage to hym\ncom.  But god that is almyghty wolde haue it to be shewed in\nexsample that men sholde not be prowde for worldly richesse,\nfor to the couetouse theire richesse doth hem but harme that\nslepen in auerice, and for-yete god and don the werkes of the\ndeuell, that ledeth hem to euerlastinge deth, and all is for the\ngrete delite that thei haue in richesse.  But now shall I telle\nyow whi I lough to day whan I saugh the Emperesse comynge\nand hir lechours, I do yow to wite that it was but for dispite,\nffor I saugh that she was youre wif, and hadde oon of the\nworthiest men of the worlde that eny man knoweth of youre\nyowthe, and she hadde take these xij harlottes and wende euer\nfor to haue ledde this foly all hir lif; and ther-fore hadde I grete\ndispite for the love of yow and of youre doughter, ffor she is\nyoure doughter with-oute doute, and draweth litill after hir\nmoder.  Now haue ye herde alle the laughtres and wherefore thei were, and therfore may I go yef it be youre\nplesier.\"  \"Now a-bide a litill,\" seide the Emperour, \"and telle vs the\ntrouthe of Grisandolus, and also we shull sende to digge after\nthe tresour for I will wite yef it be trewe,\" and he ther-to dide\nassent; than the Emperour comaunded that Grisandolus were\nsought, and so she was founden oon of the feirest maydenes that\nneded to enquere in eny londe, and whan the Emperour knewe\nthat Grisandolus, his stiwarde, that longe hadde hym serued was\na woman, he blissed hym for the wonder that he ther-of\nhadde.  Than he asked the sauage man counseile what he sholde do of\nthat he hadde promysed to yeve his doughter, and half his\nreame, ffor loth he was to falsen his promyse of couenaunt.  \"I\nshall telle yow,\" quod the man, \"what ye shull do yef ye will\ndo my counseile, and wite it well, it is the beste that eny man\ncan yeven.\"  \"Sey on, than,\" seide Emperour, \"ffor what\ncounseile that thow yevest I shall it well be-leve, for I haue\nfounde thy seyinge trewe.\"  Than seide the sauage man, \"Ye\nshall take Avenable to be yowre wif, and wite ye whos doughter\nshe is.  She is doughter to the Duke matan that the Duke\nffrolle hath disherited and driven oute of his londe for envye\nwith grete wronge, and he and his wif be fledde, and his sone,\nthat is a feire yonge squyer, in to Province in to a riche town\nthat is called monpellier; and sende to seche hem and yelde hem\nher heritage that thei haue loste with wronge, and make the\nmariage of youre doughter and Auenables brother that is so feire,\nand ye may her no better be setten.\"  And whan the Barouns\nvndirstode that the sauage man seide, thei spoke moche a-monge\nhem, and seiden in the ende that the Emperour myght do no\nbetter after theire advis; and than the Emperour asked his name,\nand what he was, and the hert that so pertly spake vnto hym,\nand than seide he, \"Sir, of that enquere no more, ffor it is a\nthinge the more ye desire to knowe the lesse shall ye\nwiten.\"  \"Ffor sothe,\" seide the Emperour, \"now suppose I well what\nit may be, but shull ye telle us eny more.\"  \"Ye,\" quod he,\n\"I tolde yow right now of the lyon crowned and of the lyon volage, but now shall I telle yow in other manere, for that ye\nshull be better remembred whan tyme cometh.  Emperour of\nRome,\" quod he, \"this is trewe prophesie that the grete boor\nof Rome that is signified by the grete dragon, shall go a-gein\nthe lyon crowned of the bloy Breteyne a-gein the counseile of\nthe turtell that hath an heed of golde and longe hath ben his\nlove.  But the boor shall be so full of pride that he will nothir\nbe-leve, but shall go with so grete pride with all his generacion\nin to the parties of Gaule to fight with the crowned lyon that\nshall come a-geins hym with alle his beestes.  Ther shall be\ngrete slaughter of beestes on bothe sides.  Than shall oon of\nthe fawnes of the lyon crowned sle the grete boor, and ther-fore\nI praye the yef thow wilt ought do for me er I departe that\nthow do nothinge a-gein the volunte of thy wif, after that day\nthat thow haste her wedded, and wite well yef thow do thus\nthow shalt haue profite, and now I take my leve for here haue\nI no more to do.\"  And the Emperour be-taught hym to god seth\nit myght no better be, and ther-with he wente on his wey, and\nwhan he com to the halle dore he wrote letteres on the lyntell\nof the dore in grewe that seide, \"Be it knowe to alle tho that\nthese letteres reden, that the sauage man that spake to the\nEmperour and expounded his dreme, hit was Merlin of\nNorthumberlande, and the hert brancus with xv braunches that spake to\nhym in his halle at mete a-monge alle his knyghtes, and was\nchaced thourgh the Citee of Rome, that spake to Auenable in the\nforeste whan he tolde hir how she sholde fynde the man sauage;\nand lete the Emperour well wite that Merlin is maister\ncounseller to kynge Arthur of the grete Breteyne.\"  And than he\ndeparted and spake no mo wordes.  Whan this sauage man was\ndeparted from the Emperour, he sente in to Province to seche\nthe fader and the moder of Auenable and Patrik hir brother, in\nthe town of monpeller, whider as thei were fledde; and a-noon\nthei com gladde and ioyfull of the auenture that god hadde hem\nsente, and whan thei were comen thei hadde grete ioye of theire\ndoughter that thei wende neuer to haue seyn.  Than thei a-bide\nwith the Emperour longe tyme, and the Emperour restored hem to here herytage that ffrolle hadde hem be-rafte.  But as ffrolle\nmyght he it a-gein seide, ffor he was of grete power, and so\nendured the werre longe tyme.  But in the ende the Emperour\nmade the pees, and than he maried his doughter to Patrik, and\nhym-self toke Auenable to his wif, and grete was the ioye and\nthe feeste that the Barouns maden, for moche was she be-loved\nbothe of riche and pore, and as the Emperour was in ioye and\ndeduyt of his newe spouse, ther com a massage to hym oute\nof Greece for a discorde that was be-twene the barouns of Greese\nand the Emperour Adrian, that sholde hem Iustise, ffor the\nEmperour Adrian myght vn-ethe ride for febilnesse of age, and\nwhan the messagers hadde spoke to the Emperour and don all\nthat he sholde, he toke his leve to go, and as he caste vp his yie\nvpon the halle dore and saugh the letteres that Merlin hadde\nwriten in griewe, and a-noon he redde hem lightly, and than\nhe gan to laughe right harde, and shewed hem to the Emperour,\nand seide, \"Sir, is this trewe that these lettres seyn.\"  \"What\nsey thei,\" quod the Emperour, \"wote ye neuer.\"  Quod the\nmessager, \"Thei seyn that he that tolde yow the vntrouthe of\nyoure wif, and youre dreme expowned, and spake to yow in\ngise of an herte, that it was Merlin of Northumbirlande, the\nmaister counseller of kynge Arthur of Breteyne, by whos\ncounseile ye haue spoused youre wif Auenable.\"  And whan the\nEmperour vndirstode these wordes he merveiled sore; and than\nbe-fill a grete merveile, whereof alle that were ther-ynne hadde\nwonder, and the Emperour hym-self; ffor as soone as the\nEmperour herde what the letteres mente, a-noon the letteres\nvanysshed so sodeynly that no man wiste how, and ther-of\nhadde thei grete wonder, and moche it was spoken of thourgh\nthe contrey.  But now cesseth the tale of the Emperour of\nRome that a-bode in his paleise gladde and myry with his wif\nAuenable, and ledde goode lif longe tyme, for bothe were thei\nyonge peple, ffor the Emperour was but xxviij yere of age at\nthat hour, and his wif was xxij, and yef thei ledde myri lif, yet\nPatrik and ffoldate, the doughter of the Emperour, lyved in more\ndelite.  But now returneth the tale a-gein to speke of Merlin.", "23": "CHAPTER XXIV. BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWELVE KINGS AND THE SAISNES BEFORE THE CITY OF CLARENCE. Here seith the book that as soone as Merlin was departed\nfrom Julius sezar, the Emperour of Rome, to whom he\nhadde tolde his a-vision, he toke his wey in to the grete Breteyne,\nand com in to Northumbirlande to Blaase his maister, that gladde\nwas whan that he hym saugh, but he was but litill while in\ncomynge, ffor he com theder in half a day and oon nyght ffor\nhe was full of grete art, and than he tolde hym all these thinges\nthat were be-falle in Rome, and after he tolde hym how xij\nkynges and a Duke were assembled with xl Ml men for to go\nfight with the saisnes be-fore the Citee of Clarence, and tolde\nhym of the grete bateile that hadde be vnder the Castell of\nTrebes in the reame of Benoyk of the kynge Arthur a-gein the\nAlmaynes, and a-gein the Romayns, and a-gein the frenshe men\nof Gaule and of la desert, and how alle were discounfited, and\nhow the kynge Ban hadde geten his wif with childe, soche oon\nthat shall surmounte alle the knyghtes that shull be in his\ntyme; and whan he hadde all tolde, and Blaase hadde all writen\nin his book, where thourgh we haue yet the knowynge\nther-of.  But now we moste reste of Merlin and of Blaase till a-nother\ntyme, and speke of the xij princes that were assembled as ye\nhaue herde be-fore for to fight with the saisnes. Whan these xij kynges and this Duke weren assembled\nwith as moche peple as thei myght haue, thei toke\ncounseile, and ordeyned her wardes, and than rode forth by\nnyght that thei were not seyn of no peple.  The firste warde\nledde Aguysans, the kynge de Cent chiualiers, that was a full\nnoble knyght, vaillaunt and hardy, and right stronge as of his\nyowthe, and hadde in his companye vij Ml men of armes.  The\nseconde warde ledde the kynge Tradiliuauns of North-Wales\nthat was a full goode man and a trewe, and with hym vij Ml men of armes.  The thridde warde ledde the kynge Belynans of\nSouth wales, his brother, that was also a noble knyght with\nvij Ml men of armes.  The fourthe warde ledde the kynge Carados\nbrenbas with v Ml men.  The fithe warde ledde the kynge Brangore with vij Ml men, and the vj e ledde the Duke Escam\nof Cambenyk with vij Ml men.  The seuenthe warde ledde the\nkynge Clarion, of Northumbirlonde, with vij Ml men.  The viij\nwarde ledde the kynge ydiers of Cornewaile, that was a feire\nknyght and an amerouse, and welbeloued a-monge ladyes with\nvij Ml men, and the ix e ledde the kynge Vrien that was a noble\nknyght, and a sure of his body; but sory he was and wroth for\nhis sones that he hadde loste, and full sore was he greved in the\nwerre so that he hadde not but iij Ml men of armes that he\nbrought in his companye, but thei were bolde and hardy.  The\ntenthe warde ledde the kynge Aguysans of Scotlonde, that was\nwonte to be so riche a londe, and so plentevouse of goode men,\nbut he hath loste many in the werre that he hadde but thre Ml men of armes.  The xj e warde ledde the kynge Loot of Orkanye,\nand hadde all loste bothe wif, and childeren, and all his feire\nmeyne, wherfore he was so sorowfull that he hadde leuer dye\nthan lyve, ffor so was he greved with the werre that his peple\nwas but small, but tho were orped knyghtes, and the beste of\nall the hoste for to endure and suffre traueile of armes.  The\nxij the warde ledde the kynge Ventres of Garlot, that was a full\nnoble knyght and a sure, and he was full wroth in herte for his\nsone that hadde hym lefte that he loved so hertely, and hadde\ngretly be greved with saisnes, that he hadde in his companye\nbut two thousande men and thre hundred, what on horsebak and\non foote; and whan her peple were disseuered and her wardes\ndevided, the barouns assembled and asked oon of a-nother how\nthei sholden don, and than thei a-corded to go fight be-fore the\ntown of Clarence, and that thei sholde not ride but by myght\nand smyte sodeynly in to the hoste on all partes, ffor better is it\nfor vs to dye with worship than to lyve in shame; and with that departed the counseile of the barouns, and eche wente to his\npavelon; and whan thei hadde souped thei comaunded her\npeple to arme hem and make redy for to ride; and a-noon thei\nwere appareilled thourgh the hoste and rode forth on her\nwey.  And ther was a spie of the kynges Hardogabran that hadde herde\nall the doynge of the barouns.  This aspie paste oute of the\nhoste previly, and com to the sege that was be-fore Clarence\ngrete and merveilouse, and tolde to the kynge Hardogabran all\nthe aray that he hadde seyn, and how that the cristin com\nwith grete spede; and whan that the saisnes vndirstoden that\nthe cristin were comynge, thei asked how moche peple thei\nmyght be in all, and he seide that thei were not xl Ml , and than\nthe saisnes ne sette nought ther-by, ne deyned not to arme the\nfourthe part of hem.  But neuertheles the kynge Hardogabran\nmade the hoste to be waicched bothe day and nyght; and also\nther were xx kynges that after that thei herde that the cristin\nwere comynge, thei wolde neuer be disgarnysshed of her\narmes.  But now we moste returne to the cristin that com ridinge. These xii princes ride so by nyght till that thei com nygh\nthe hoste a litill be-fore day, and the weder was\nsomwhat trouble and wyndy, and be-gan for to reyne; and thei in\nthe hoste were the hevyer of slepe, and thei toke noon hedde\nthat eny peple sholde come on hem at soche tyme, and whan\nthe cristin saugh theire herberowe that noon ne come oute ne\nmade no noyse, a-noon thei right theire armour; and whan thei\nwere redy thei departed theire peple in to thre parties, and in\nthat oon part was the kynge Clarion, and in that other part was\nthe kynge Ventres of Garlot, and Carados, and Brangores, and\nTradilyuans, and Belynans his brother; and in the thridde\npartie was the kynge Aguysas, and the kynge Vrien, and as\nsoone as thei were disseuered thei rode a softe paas, theire hedes\nenclyned vnder theire helmes, and whan thei com nygh the\ntentes, thei lete theire horse go as faste as thei myght renne, and\nkutte a-sonder cordes and ropes of the loiggynges, and threwe\ndown tentes and pavelouns, and slowh and maymed alle that thei\na-raught at her comynge, and than a-roos the noyse and the showte so grete that all the foreste resounded.  Ther was grete\nmartire and grete occision of saisnes, er the men of armes that\nsholde haue waicched the hoste were horsed, and whan thei\nsaugh hem so surprised thei lepe to horse and rode to the kynge\nHardogabrans tente, and blewe hornes on euery parte, and\nassembled to-geder bothe armed and vn-armed, and the xx kynges\nlepe to horse, and eche hadde x Ml men at his baner, and ronne\nagein the cristen, and smote thourgh sheldes and hauberkes,\nthat many ther were slayn on bothe partyes; and the xij princes\nsuffred sore traueile, for thei were full noble knyghtes, and well\nhem helped Segurades, and Drias the lorde of salerne, and Mares,\nand Dorilas, and Brandins de la dolerouse garde, and Bruyns\nsaunz pitee.  These dide so well that neuer knyghtes myght\ndo better, and on that other part were to-geder the Castelein of\nGazell, and the lorde of blakeston, and the lorde of mares, and\nthe lorde of wyndesore, and Aliers, and Gaudius, and the nevew\nof kynge Vrien, these ought not to be forgeten, for a-gein hem\nmyght noon armour endure were it neuer so harde.  These x\nknyghtes drough to the xij princes as soone as thei saugh hem\nat the logges where thei stode stifly, and foughten harde and\nsore, and so many slough the cristin that the horse wente in\nblode vp to the pastrouns.  But the saisnes were so many and\nso thikke, that be fin force thei drof hem fro the tentes, but\nthei wente not vileyusly, but as noble men and hardy; ffor\nwhan the worthi men saugh thei were putte bakke thei were\na-schamed, and hadde ther-of grete dispite.  Than thei assembled\nand mette hem in the visages.  Ther was stronge shour, and\nsore eche of hem shewde her hardynesse and his grete prowesse,\nand eche of hem seide that neuer was he worthi to be cleped a\nknyght that failed at that nede for to helpe so well that it\nmyght be spoke of all his lif after; with this wordes eche smote\nhis horse with spores and cried his ensigne, and thei smyte in\nso harde a-monge the Saisnes, that many ther were deed and\nwounded gapinge vp-right ther as thei passed; but the saisnes\ncom oute of the tentes soche foyson that no man myght counte\nthe nombre, and hardogabran, a saisne, moche and grete oute of mesure com formest; ffor the storye seith that he was xv\nfoote of lengthe, but he was yonge of xxviij yere of age.  This\nkynge hardogabran satte vpon a grete gray stede with a spere\nin his hande, grete and shorte, and hadde a staffe hanginge on\nhis lifte side where-with that day he made many a knyght\nsory and wroth; and whan the cristin saugh this grete deuell\ncomynge, thei douted for to mete hym, the beste and the moste\nhardyest of all the cristin hoste, and made hym wey; and\nCarados of the perilouse tour hym mette, for he was the grettest\nand the strengest of all the cristin hoste, and was xxx yere of\nage, and as soone as he saugh the grete devell he lete renne\nto hym for nothinge he hym douted, and thei mette so harde\nwith theire speres vpon the sheldes, and in passinge fourth thei\nhurteled so harde with her helmes and sheldes that bothe thei\nfill to the grounde, and theire horse also; and whan bothe\npartyes saugh these tweyne falle, thei pressed to the rescowse\non bothe parties.  Ther suffred the cristin grete peyne and\ntraueile er that Carados myght be remounted, and the reyne\nhem greved sore that thei hadde the nyght and the day, ffor\nit cessed neuer of reynynge till that mydday was passed, and\nthei were so wete grete and small, that vn-ethe myght thei eche\nknowe other but by theire speche. Full grete was the bataile and the stour mortall for sore\neche other dide hate.  Ther dide the cristin well preve\ntheire prowesse, for magre hem thei sette Carados on horse, that\nBloys of Plaisshie hym brought where-from he hadde smyten\ndown the kynge Graalant, and matan and alibos, two yonge\nknyghtes, and the lorde of Nohaut, and the Castelein of\nMolehaut, mayntened the stour so well that thei ought not to be\nblamed till that Carados was remounted, and than be-gan the\nstour all newe for many ther were of goode knyghtes on the\ncristin partye, and on the hethen side grete pride; ffor many\nther were of riche men and puyssant, and hadde soche plente\nof peple that the cristen were not but litill shewed a-monge\nhem, and therfore hadde thei moche the werse, for thei were\nat grete myschef; and in this maner thei foughten till mydday was paste, and than be-gan the day for to clere, and the sonne\nto shewe out his bemes and dryed theire harneys, and than\nbe-gan the stour to enforce more and more.  But the saisnes\nwere so many that of fin force thei droff hem oute of the\nfeelde, and brought hem to the plaisshes, and ther thei stynted\nlonge tyme; ffor the kynge de cent Chiualers with-stode firste\nand cleped his ensigne many tymes, and seide to the barouns,\n\"What lordynges, wheder will ye go.  Certes full euell holde\nye the promyse that we devised hedirwarde; ffor yet be we\nhooll and sounde, and oure armoure hooll also, and we be thus\ndiscounfited that noon of vs dar shewe his valour, wele ought\nwe to be reproved, and well owe we to remembre that whan\nwe be departed oon from a-nother, that yef we be oute of sorowe\nissed in to moche more dolour be we entred,\" and whan the\nbarouns vndirstode that the kynge de Cent Chiualiers hem seide,\nthei returned a-gein fiercely, and eche of hem smote so the\nfirste that he mette, that deed he fill to grounde, and ther\nbe-gan the bataile more crewell than it hadde all the day\nbe-fore.  Ther dide the kynge de Cent Chyualiers so well that\nmoche was he preised and be-loved of the high barouns; ffor\ner he departed his sheilde was all to daisht, that the thridde part\nne left not hooll, and his hauberke dismayled and his helme\nperced, and his armes all be-soiled in blode, and his horse heed\nand all the fore body was soyled with bloode and brayn, that\nhe myght not be knowe, but by his speche; and also ther\na-boode the kynge Vryen and Bawdemagn, his nevew, and the\nkynge ydiers, and the kynge loot, and the kynge ventres, and\nDorilas, these wolde neuer leve the stour as longe as thei myght\na-bide in place, and ther thei dide the saisnes grete damage,\nffor moo thei slowgh than that thei hadde don all the day\nbe-fore; and whan the saisnes saugh the damage that thei hem\ndide, thei blewen hornes and trumpes, and made soche noyse a\ntempest that oon myght it heare two myle longe, and than com\nOrienx a saisne with foure thousand men of armes all fressh\nand newe, and frusht in to the medle so harde that they made\nhem alle to remeve place, and than a-roos the noyse and the chace all the day on ende till it was nyght that the cristin\nmyght neuer recouer for to holde place, but were all\ndiscounfited, and yef the nyght were not so soone come vpon,\nmore hadde thei myshapped, and whan the saisnes hadde loste\nthe day light, thei returned to theire tentes and vn-armed hem,\nand esed hem, and sette hem to soper, and ete and dranke\nplente, and after soper thei slepe and toke theire reste as\nthey that well wende to be sure on all partyes, but full angry\nthei were of the harme that the cristen hadde hem don that\nday, and gladly ther-of wolde thei ben a-venged, yef thei myght\ncome in place, ffor the storie seith thei loste moo than xx Ml men,\nand the cristen loste x Ml .  But now returne we to speke of\nthe xij princes that be full of sorowe and angre for the\ndisconfiture that is vpon hem turned, and seide a-monge hem that\nso wolde thei it nought leten, but that thei wolden don hem\nmore damage er that thei wolde departed. Now whan the barouns were so discounfited, and were\nsomwhat fer from the tentes of the saisnes, thei a-light on\nfoote, and a-mended theire armours, and refresshed theire horse;\nbut thei were all be-soiled with bloode and myre, bothe theire\narmes and theire horse that no colour myght be knowen;\nand whan thei were redy, thei lepte to horse and rode a softe\npaas cloos to-geder so stilliche, that noon ne spake a worde till that thei com to the tentes a-boute mydnyght, and fonde the\nhoste all a-slepe; ffor tho thei wende to haue ben all saf for\nthe discounfiture that thei hadde don; and whan the cristin\ncom to the tentes thei ronne in with so grete raveyn, for thei\nwere yet xxx ti Ml of horsmen, and thei threwe down tentes\nand Pavilouns, and slowgh many of the saisnes, that noon ascaped\nthat fill to theire handes; and the saisnes lepte oute of her\nbeddes all slepy, and cried, \"Treson, treson,\" and assembled\nat Hardogabrans tente, where oon blewe a trumpe, and the\nsaisnes entended to nothinge elles but to renne to that trumpe,\nand than thei hem armed, and a-raied as faste as thei myght; and thei light vp torches, and lanternes, and fire brondes\ngrete plente, that the light myght haue be seyn iij myle\nlonge. The cristin neuer cessed to kille and to sle, and mangeled\nalle that thei myght take, that the stremes of blode\nran as of a welle springe, and thus the slaughter endured all\nthe nyght till it was day; and whan the saisnes saugh the\ngrette losse and martire that thei maden, thei were woode for\nwrath and ire, and than they com on fresshly as though they sholde haue all confounded in theire comynge, and the cristen\nhem deffended in the beste maner.  But yet the saisnes droff\nhem oute from the tentes foule and lothly; and than be-gonne\nthe horse of the cristin to feynte sore as they that two dayes\nhadde not eten, and ther-of were thei sore discounforted; ffor\nthei saugh that alle were thei in a-venture of deth.  Than\nfill the barons in corage as god wolde, the yonge knyghtes that\nI haue named be-fore, that thei wolde Iuste with the saisnes\nfor to wynne hem other horse where-on thei myght ride, or\nelles thei were in grete pereile alle to perissh.  Than eche of\nthe barons toke a grete spere, and rode in to the renges a xl\nof knyghtes of pris, and hit is reson to reherse theire names\nof the worthi lordes.  The firste was the kynge ydiers of\nCornewaile, and the kynge Ventres of Garlot, and his nevew\nthat euer kepte hym a-boute hym; the fourthe was kynge loot\nof Orcanye; the v e was kynge Clarion of Northumbirlonde; the\nsixthe was kynge Christofer, and his nevew that hilde the depe\nCite of Gaunt, and the lorde of the dolerouse garde, and Bruns\nsaunz pitee, and the lorde of Nohaut, and the lorde of the\nforest perilouse, and the kynge de Cent Chiualiers, and the\nkynge Tradylyuaunt of North wales, and Polydomas his nevew,\nand the kynge Brangore, and the kynge aguysas of Scotlonde,\nand Gaudin his nevew, and the Duke Escam of Cambenyk,\nand the lorde of salerne, and the kynge Vrien, and Badmagn\nhis nevew, and the kynge Belynans of South wales, and Carados de la dolerouse toure, and as many of other knyghtes that thei were well thre score. These com in the first fronte with speres in fewtre for to\nIuste, for grete myster hadde thei of horse, and eueriche\nof hem smote oon so harde that he fill deed to the grounde, or\nwounded, and sesed the horse by the reynes, and wente with\nhem a-side in to the feilde, and a-light from theire horse, and\nlepte on hem that thei hadde wonne, and returned a-gein in\nto bateile, and be-gonne to smyte down men and horse to\ngrounde, for to remounte her company vpon fresshe horses that\nther-to hadden grete nede, and all the day noon of hem wolde\ndeparte from other; ffull harde and felon was the bateile ther,\nas these thre score were newe I-horsed, and longe it endured;\nbut the saisnes dide euer encrese more and more, and made\nthe cristen to voyde the place, but that was with grete peyne,\nffor the saisnes peyned hem sore to a-venge the harmes that\nthei hadden don, and the cristin were talentif to a-venge her\nfrendes, that the paynymes hadde slayn; but in the ende were\nthe cristin discounfited and chaced oute of the feilde.  But ther\nendured grete traueile the thre score knyghtes; ffor thei kepte\nhem-self all-ther hinderest for to diffende the other that feyntly\nwere horsed that myght no faster go than a paas; and these\nthre score knyghtes wisten well that alle were thei deed or\ntaken yef thei hem for-saken, and so thei mayntened the bateile\nas longe as thei myght suffre till that her companye was well\npaste; and than thei wente her wey after, and whan thei were\nouer-taken thei with-stode and foughten with the saisnes full\nharde, and whan eny of these knyghtes fill, thei alle a-boode\ntill he were remounted; but nought for than moche thei losten\nat the laste, ffor right many of her men were slain and wounded,\nand taken prisoners.  In this manere were the cristin\ndiscounfited, and the saisnes hem chaced fer in to the foreste,\nwhere-as thei hem leften be-cause of the nyght that com on,\nand than the saisnes returned to theire loigges with grete plente\nof prisoners; and alwey after that the saisnes made better\nwaicche than thei hadde don be-fore, and the cristin were in the foreste for socour, and rode forth till thei com in to a feire\nlaunde, and ther thei a-light on foote from theire horse and\nmade grete doell and sorowe for theire losse, and were so\ndiscounforted, that thei wiste not what for to do ne whider to\ngo; but in the ende thei a-corded that eche man sholde go to\nhis repeire, and yef the saisnes come hem for to assaile eche\nman deffende hym-self the beste wise that he may; with that\nthei lept to horse, and eche comaunded other to god and\ndeparted wepinge for pite that oon from that other, and eche\nwente hoom to his repeire, and stuffed hem with peple, and\nvitaile the beste that thei myght; and after that the saisnes\nhadde hem thus discounfited thei douted hem nothinge, but\nronne thourgh her londes, and brente and distroied and token\nprisoners, and brought in to the hoste many prayes; and neuer\nafter were the kynges so bolde to isse out of her castelles and\ntownes for to fight with the saisnes.  But now we moste\nspeke of the kynge Arthur that is in the see towarde the\ngrete Breteyne.", "24": "CHAPTER XXV. ARTHUR'S MEETING WITH LEODOGAN; MARRIAGE OF ARTHUR AND GONNORE. Now seith the storie, that whan the kynge Arthur and the\nbarouns were assembled and entred in to the shippes,\nthei sailed till thei come to the bloy Breteyne; and as soone\nas thei were arived thei lepe vpon horse and ryde so day and\nnyght, till thei come to logres the thirde day, and ther were\nthei richely welcomed, and the moste ioye that myght be made\nto eny peple; and ther thei dide soiourne thre dayes with\ngrete feeste; and the fourthe day remeved the kynge Arthur\nand Gawein, and his brethren, and the kynge Ban of Benoyk,\nand the kynge Bohors of Gannes, with thre thousande men\nof armes with-oute moo, and rode so by her iourneyes that thei come in to the reame of Carmelide, a two myle from\nToraise, where the kynge leodogan soiourned, and whan he\nherde tydinges that the kynge Arthur com, he rode a-geins\nhym, he and his meyne two myle or more, and whan thei were\nmette ther was made grete ioye, and welcomynge be-twene the two kynges that well loved, and so dide alle the other\nbarouns and lordes; and whan thei com in to the town thei\nfonde it all hanged with riche clothes, and strowed with fresh\nherbes, and fonde ladyes and maydenes carolinge and\ndaunsinge, and the moste reuell and disport that myght be made;\nand on that other side these yonge bachelers of pris brake\nsperes in bourdinge oon a-gein a-nother, and thus thei conveyed\nhem vn-to the town, where-as Gonnore, the doughter of kynge\nleodogan com hem for to meten.  But who so made ioye she\nwas gladdest of alle other; ffor as soone as she saugh the kynge\nArthur she ran to hym with armes spredde a-brode, and seide\nhe was welcome and alle his companye; and she kiste his\nmouth tendirly, seynge hem alle that wolde, and than eche\ntoke other by the hande and went vp in to the paleise, and\nwhan it was tyme of soper thei ete and dranke grete plente,\nfor I-nough thei haue where-of; and whan thei hadde disported\nhem a longe while after soper they wente to bedde for to resten\nhem, for wery they were of traueile; and on the morowe erly\na-roos the kynge Arthur, and the kynge Bohors, and the kynge\nBan, and Sir Gawein, and Ewein that gladly roos euer erly\nmore that eny other, and wente to the mynster to here messe,\nand than com a-gein in to the paleise a-bove, and fonde the\nkynge leodogan that hadde herde messe in his chapell, and than\nthei asked horse and rode forth tho vj with-oute eny moo,\nand yede to disporte hem, and to se the medowes and the\nriver; and than the kynge leodogan a-resoned the kynge Arthur,\nand asked him whan he sholde spousen his doughter, ffor he\nseide that it was tyme; and the kynge Arthur ansuerde that\nwhiche hour that hym plesed, ffor he was ther-to redy; \"but I moste a-bide the beste frende that I haue, ffor with-oute hym\nwill I do nothinge in no manere;\" and than he asked whiche\nwas that frende, and he tolde hem how it was Merlin, \"be whom\nI haue recouered londe and honour, and all the goode that I\nhaue ellis,\" and whan sir Gawein vndirstode the wordes, he seide\nthat he hadde grete reson for to love hym well, \"and eche oon\nof vs oweth to desire his comynge, and wite it well he shall\ncome er ought longe seth that ye hit desire.\"  \"Certes,\" seide\nthe kynge Arthur \"he tolde me that he sholde be here all\nin tyme.\"  \"Than ther is no more,\" quod Gawein, \"but lete\nvs sette the day of spousaile;\" and than toke thei day to-geder\nthe vtas after, and com thus spekynge in to the halle, and\nfonde the clothes leyde, and all thinge redy, and than thei\nwaissh as thei ought to do, and weren serued as noble princes\nsholden be; and after mete thei wente to disporte, thei that\nwolde, and thus thei soiourned alle the viij dayes full.  But\nnow resteth a litill to speke of hem at this tyme, and returne\nto the xij princes that were disconfit be-fore the town of\nClarence. After that the kynges were thus discounfited, and were\nrepeired eche of hem hom to his repeire; till that\ntydinges a-roos thourgh the londe that the kynge Arthur hadde\npassed the see, and hadde a-dubbed the sones of kynge loot,\nand the twey sones of kynge Vrien, and Galashin, the sone of\nkynge Ventre of Garlot, and Dodynell the sauage, the sone of\nkynge Belynant of South wales, and kay destranx, the nevew\nof kynge Carados, and Seigramour, the Emperours nevew of\nConstantynnoble, and his felowes that hadde brought with hym;\nand how the wif of kynge loot was at logres whider that his\nowne sones hadde hir brought and taken hir from the saisnes;\nand how the brethren hadde sworn, that neuer hir fader the\nkynge loot sholde haue theire moder in companye till that he\nhadde made homage to the kynge Arthur, and lete hym wele\nknowe that he hadde no werse enmy than that thei wolden\nbe; and how that kynge Arthur hadde foughten with the kynge\nClaudas and Pounce Antonye be-fore the castell of Trebes, and with ffrolle the Duke of Almayne, and Randolf the Senescall\nof Gaule, and hadde hem alle discounfited, and chaced oute\nof the feelde, and restored the two brethern to theire londes;\nand how he sholde take to wif the doughter of the kynge\nleodogan of Carmelide, and how he hadde discounfited the kynge\nRion be-fore the Cite of Danablaise, and how he was gon in to\nCarmelide for to spouse his wif.  Of these thinges spake the\nprinces prively to hir counseile, and seide that thei dide grete\nsynne euer hym for to wrath, ffor alle these harmes that to\nhem was fallen was but for the synne that thei hadde don\na-geins hym, and thei dide repente sore of the hate that was\nbe-twene hem, yef thei myght other-wise haue don; and preiden\ngod hertely that thei myght come in soche poynte that thei\nwere acorded, be so that thei ther-by be not shamed; and so\nran the tydinges of the kynge Arthur, that the kynge loot it\nherde, and wiste how that his wif was at logres, and his litill\nsone Mordred, and therfore in oon manere he was gladde and\nin a-nother he was wroth; gladde for that she was delyuered\noute of the handes of the saisnes, and angry for that his\nchildren hadde sworn that neuer sholde he haue hir in\ncompanye of hym, ne haue theire love till that he hadde made\nhomage to kynge Arthur; but he saugh not how he myght\nwith hym be acorded with his honour, but yef god wolde helpe\nhym of counseile, and than he be-thought hym how Arthur\nwolde sende his wif to logres Chief Citee, and as soone as he\nmyght knowe of hir comynge he wolde gon hir a-geins with\nas moche peple as he myght haue and fight with hym, and\nassay to take Arthurs wif, and for hir myght he haue a-gein his. Thus thought the kynge loot, but other-wise sholde it go,\nyef god kepe the force of kynge Arthur and of Sir\nGawein, his nevew.  Than the kynge loot sente his aspies fer and\nnygh, for to knowe whan the kynge Arthur sholde come from\nthe reme of Carmelyde, and how moche peple that he hadde\nin his companye, and he hym appareiled for to ride hym\na-geins.  But of these thynges cesseth the tale at thys tyme, and speketh\nof Merlin, that was with Blaase in Northumbirlande, that alle these thinges hath hym tolde, and he hath hem alle in his\nbooke wreten; and the storye seith that as soone as the kynge\nArthur hadde seide to the kynge leodogan that he a-boode\nnothinge elles but the comynge of Merlin, a-noon Merlin it\nwiste, and alle the wordes that were ther seide, and that he\nwiste the purpos of the xij kynges, and of the kynge loot, and\nhow he hadde sente his aspies, and alle he tolde to Blase, and\nhe wrote euer as he tolde; and Merlin com to Toraise in\nCarmelide, where-as the Barons hym a-bode, and that was the\neuen be-fore that the kynge sholde spousen his wif, and as\nsoone as the Barouns hym saugh, thei were of hym right gladde\nand ioyfull, as thei that moche desired his feliship.  But now\nwe moste a litill turne for to speke of Gonnore the stepdoughter\nof Cleodalis, the senescall of Carmelide, and of his kynnysmen\nthat right moche hated the kynge leodogan. Here seith the book that Gonnore, the doughter of the\nsenescallis wif, hadde right riche kynne of goode\nknyghtes that sore hated the kynge leodogan, for the grete shame that he dide to Cleodalis of his wif, that he so longe hadde\nholden in a-vouterie maugre Cleodalis, and alle his frendes, and\nlonge hadde thei kept prevy the hate that thei durste not\nther-of speke; but thei thought well to be wroken whan thei\nsaugh tyme, and it fill the same day that Merlin was come\nthei were assembled of hem xvj, and spake to-geder, but at\nthis parlement was not Cleodalis, ne ther-of knewe no worde;\nand oon of hem asked in what manere thei myght beste greve\nor wrathe the kynge leodogan, and theire counseile was this:\nffor thei a-corded in the ende that thei sholde so speke to the\nmaistresse of Gonnore, that was Arthurs wif, that whan she\nsholde be brought to bedde to the kynge Arthur, hir lorde,\nthis olde maistresse sholde brynge hir down in to the gardin\nto disport, and ther while thei sholde sette ther the tother\nGonnore, their cosin, in stede of hir that was Arthurs wif; and\nhir thei sholde sette in soche place that neuer man sholde\nhere-after more of hir speke, ne no man sholde wite where she\nwere be-come; and a-noon lete vs go and do so moche to the maistresse that thus it may be don, and whan we haue brought\nthis a-boute, we shull be lordes bothe of the kinge and quene,\nand of alle hem that be with the kynge. Than thei ordeyned that vij of hem sholde do this thefte,\nand stele hir a-wey be the gardin, where-as thei sholde\nbe hidde, and haue ther shippe redy to putte hir ynne.  To\nthis counseile thei were a-corded, and thei dide so purchese\na-gein the maistresse, that she graunted hir will to performe;\nand thei departed than gladde and mery as thei that wende\nwell to haue spedde, and ordeyned the shippe and all that was\nmyster; but a-noon as thei hadde this treson spoken Merlin\nit wiste, and tolde it to Vlfin and to Bretell, and toke hem\na-side in counseile a-lone by hem-self, and tolde hem worde\nfor worde all the vntrouthe that thei purposed to don; and\nwhan Vlfin and Bretell herde the treson that these wolde haue\ndon, thei hadde ther-of grete merveile, and than thei preied\nMerlin to telle how thei sholde spede of this thinge.  \"With\ngode will,\" seide Merlin.  \"To morowe, at even, whan ye\nhaue souped, arme yow well vndir youre robes, and goth in\nto the chamber next the gardin vnder the greces that is ther,\nffor thei shull come alle vn-armed saf hir swerdes, and shull\ncome thourgh the gardin streight to the wiket, where-as ther\nshull bide till that the maistresse bringe hir to disporte.  But\nloke a-noon as thei haue hir sesed that ye be no feynte her to\nrescowe, ffor than a-noon haue ye her loste for euer yef thei\nmay bring hir to the shippe.\"  \"Sir,\" seide these two goode\nmen, \"yef god will, we shull not her lese, seth we knowe so\nmoche ther-of.\"  \"And loke also,\" qoud Merlin, \"that ye\nspeke here-of no worde to no man of nothinge that I haue to yow I-seide, ffor than shall I neuer yow love.\"  \"Certes,\"\nseide these two noble men, \"we hadde leuer be disherited and\nchaced oute of the londe.\" Tho dide departe these thre frendes, and com in to the\nhalle, and fonde that the knyghtes sholde departe and\nwente to theire loigginge till on the morowe that it was day,\nand than a-rise the barouns and the knyghtes, and assembled faste in the mynster paleise; and the kynge leodogan appareiled\nhis doughter so richely, as that neuer quene ne myght be better\naraied, and she ther-to was so full of grete bewte that all the\nworlde was gladde hir to be-holden; and whan she was all\nredy, the kynge Ban toke hir on that oon side, and the kynge\nBohors on that other side, and ledde hir to the mynster of\nseynt Stephene the martir.  Ther was many a baron hir to\nconveien holdinge be the hondes two and two, and formest that\nwente was kynge Arthur and kynge leodogan; and the other\ntweyne was nexte after was Gawein and Seigramour, and than\nGalashin and Agrauain the prowde, and than Dodinell and\nGueheret, and than Ewein le graunt, and Gaheries; and after\nthat Ewein a-voutres and kay destranx, and kay the stiward\nand antor his fader; and after hem com the maiden that the\nkynge Ban and the kynge Bohors ledden, that was of so grete\nbewte; and she was discheueled, and hadde the feirest heed\nthat eny woman myght haue, and hadde a sercle of goolde on\nhir heed full of preciouse stones, the feirest and the richest\nthat eny man knewe, and was clothed in a riche robe that\ntrayled to the grounde more than two fadome, that satte so\nwell with hir bewte that all the worlde myght haue ioye her\nto be-holden; and after hir com the stepdoughter of Cleodalis,\nthat hight also Gonnore, whiche was right feire and auenaunt,\nand hir ledde Gifflet and lucas the boteller; and after com\nthe newe dubbed knyghtes two and two; and after com the\nknyghtes of the rounde table; and after that com the Barouns\nof the reame of Carmelide and the knyghtes; and after the\nburgeys of the contrey, and than the ladyes of the contrey,\nand maydenes, and so thei com to the mynster. Whan thei com to the dore, thei fonde ther the goode\nArchebisshoppe that ther hem a-bode, and sir Amnistan\nthe chapeleyn of kynge leodogan, that was a gode man of\nlyvinge; and the archebisshop hem blessed, and be-fore alle\nthe peple wedded the kynge Arthur and Gonnore to-geder;\nand the goode archebisshoppe entred in to the chirche, and sange\nthe high masse; and sir Amnistan hym serued, and ther was riche offringe of kynges and princes, and whan the servise\nwas ffynisshed the kynge Arthur and the Barouns returned in to\nthe paleys where-as was grete plente of mynstralles, and\niogelours, and other; where-to sholde I yow devise the ioye and\nthe deduyt that thei hadden, ffor the fourthe part cowde I\nnot telle.  Thus endured the ioye and the melodye all the mete\nwhile; and after mete, whan the boordes were vppe, than\nwas a-rered a quyntayn, and thyder yede the newe a-dubbed\nknyghtes for to bourde, with sheldes a-boute theire nekkes, and\nthe xl knyghtes that com in to Carmelide with the kynge\nArthur wente with hem, and also com thider the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table; and whan thei were comen thei be-gonne\nto do maistries iolily and in myrthe as thei that were worthy men and noble knyghtes.  So that tidinges com to sir Gawein\nthat satte at mete a-monge his fellowes that hadden serued;\nand whan Gawein vndirstode that his frendes were ouer-sette,\nhe a-roos vp and asked his armes and horse, and his shelde,\nand a-noon it was brought, and so dide alle his felowes, and\nGawein dide on an habergon of double maile vnder his robes\nfor that was euer more his custome euer as longe as he\nlyved.  Nought for that he thought to do eny vilonye ne treson.  But\nfor he douted euer that debate sholde a-rise amonge his felowes\nthourgh the dedes of some musarde, or eny treson where-of\nther were I-nowe in the londe; but whan that Gawein and\nhis felowes com in to the medowes where-as was the turnement\nwell be-gonne.  But the newe knyghtes were euell ledde, ffor\nthe knyghtes of the rounde table ledde hem at her volunte, and\nwhan that Gawein saugh that thei were so at the werse he was\nnothinge gladde.  Than he and his companye wenten in that\nwere well foure score a-counted, and a-noon these yonge\nknyghtes com to Gawein, and asked yef he wolde be with hem,\nand he seide ye, bothe now and also other tymes. Whan the xl sowdiours herde that sir Gawein wolde be\nwith hem at that same turnement, thei were wonder\ngladde and ioyfull, and the tother were full wroth, and than\nthei assured that neuer noon sholde faile other for deth ne for life, and no more thei diden and that well shewed that day;\nffor thei diden so well, that the knyghtes of the rounde table\nther-of hadde envye; ffor dere sholde be bought the same\nturnement, in the turnement that was made at logres, ther-as\nGawein was called lorde and maister for the wele doinge that\nhe ther dide, as ye shull heren here-after whan that he was\nbe-come the queenes knyght; and whan that Gawein hadde\ntake the suerte of his felowes and of the xl knyghtes, of whiche\nye haue herde.  Thei renged hem, and a-raide hem, and girde\na-gein theire horse, and Gawein sette hem in a-ray as he that\nwas a wise knyght, and with-oute pride, and the moste curteise\nthat was in the bloy Breteyne, and the beste taught in alle\nthinges, and euer trewe to god and to his lorde; and whan\nthat Gawein hadde ordeyned his felowes in aray, thei rode two\nand two to-geder eche after other, and tweyne the firste was\nsir Gawein and sir Ewein le graunt, the sone of kynge Vrien,\nthat Gawein loved beste of alle other, for he was the beste after\nGaheries; and the next tweyne were Seigramour and Galashyn,\nand than Gefflet and lucas the boteller, for to assemble theire\nsheldes a-boute her nekkes, and her speres streight in theire\nhandes, and the kynge Arthur, and the kynge Ban, and the\nkynge Bohors, and Merlin, and Bretell, and Vlfin, and Antor\nwere lefte with the kynge leodogan in the paleise, and were\ncomen vp on high for to se and be-holde the bourdeyse, and\nwith hem weren ladyes and maydenys grete plente, and saugh\nthat thei were redy araide for to mete. On that other side were the knyghtes of the rounde table\nredy araied, and weren an hundred and fifty, and sir\nGawein sente hem xl Iusteres, of the whiche Seigramour was\nthe firste; and on that other side com Nascien, and thei lete\ntheire horse renne that oon agein that other; and sir Gawein\nsmote be-twene hem two and hem departed, and cleped the\nknyghtes of the rounde table, and seyde, \"Ffeire lordes, ye\nbe right worthi men and goode knyghtes, the beste that eny\nknoweth.  But doth wele, and lete vs be as many for as many\noon a-geins another, by soche forwarde that yef we take eny of yours, that thei shall be with vs a-geins yow, and yef ye\ntake eny of owres, thei shull helpe yow to oure noysaunce,\nand be it don in soche manere that as soone as ye take eny man\nof oures that we shull sette a-nother in his place, and ye also\nas soone as we take eny man of yowres to do the same,\"\nThanne a-noon thei graunted to holde the couenauntes, and\nthan thei sente after theire armes in the town; and as soone\nas thei were brought thei hem armed spedily in alle haste, and\nthe tidinges therof com in to the barouns in what maner that\nsir Gawein hadde take the turnement a-gein the knyghtes of the\nrounde table; and thei preised hym gretely, bothe oon and\nother.  But a-bove alle other hym preised the kynge Bohors, and seide\nther was neuer seyn soche a knyght of his age, and yef he\nlyve longe he shall be the beste knyght that euer was, \"and that\nI hadde levest to resemble.\"  Thus spake the kynge Bohors of\nsir Gawein, and thei hem armed hastely and soone, and lepe\nto horse, and hem renged and a-ray, and eche roode a-gein\nother.  The firste that renged hym of the rounde table was\nAdragein le noir, his shelde a-boute his nekke, the spere in honde,\nand vpon a blakke stede; and on that other side com hym\na-gein Dodinell le sauage, as faste as horse myght renne, and\nsmote vpon the sheldes with sharpe grounde speres so rudely\nthat thei perced the sheldes thourgh the myght of theire armes,\nand theire horse that swyftly hem bare, that he heedes stynted\nat the hauberkes; but thei were so stronge that thei faused\nno mayle that the speres moste nede breke at the passinge\nthourgh of the horse, for bothe were thei goode knyghtes, and\nthe horse swyfte, and thei hurteled so to-geder with sheldes\nand helmes, that bothe thei ffill to grounde, horse and man;\nand as soone as thei were bothe ouerthrowen, thei ronne to\nthe rescowe on bothe parties, and mette to-geder with speres\nvpon the sheldes that thei splendered on peces, and some ther\nwere that passed thourgh with-oute fallinge, and some lay\nstille. As soone as the speres were spente, thei drough oute theire\nswerdes, and be-gonne the medle on foote and on\nhorsebak, and sir Gawein and Nascien mette to-geder with\nsperes vpon sheldes with all theire force so rudely, that thei\nall to perced, and Nasciens spere brake in Gaweins shelde; and\nGawein smote hym a-gein so rudely, that he bar hym from his\nhorse and his legges vp-right; but a-noon he lepte on foote,\nfor he was full bolde and hardy, and drough his swerde and\ncouered hym with his shelde, and apparailed hym redy for to\ndiffende; and Gawein returned and drough his swerde and\ncom to Nascien, and a-light on foote; and whan Nascien saugh\nhym come with swerde drawen, he ne douted hym but litill,\nfor he was a full noble knyght, and hardy, and right sure, and\nsmote Gawein vpon the penon of the shelde that he clef it to\nthe bocle, and Gawein paide hym vpon the helme that he fill\nvpon the palme of his handes, but soone was he risen vp a-gein\nand smote Gawein so grete a stroke vpon the helme that the\nsparkeles fly oute flamynge reade; and whan Gawein saugh\nthat it a-noyed hym sore, and than he hitte Nascien vpon the\nhelme that he made it cleve, and that Nascien fill vpon bothe\nknees, but he was of high herte, and lepte vpon foote, and in\nthe a-risinge Gawein caught hym be the helme, and raced it\nfrom his heede so harde, that his nose and his browes were\nsore hurte, and caste it as fer as he myght in to the presse, and\nthan he cried, \"sir knyght yelde the, for thow seest well how\nit is,\" and he ansuerde that he was not yet come ther-to for to\nyelde hym, for no man that he saugh.  Than he couered hym\nwith his shelde, and smote Gawein so harde on the shelde,\nthat a grete pece fill on the grene, and Gawein lepte to hym\nand smote hym so with the pomell of his swerde on the temple,\nthat he fill to the erthe vp-right; and than he lepte to hym and\na-bated down the coif of maile of his heede and seide, \"Yelde\nthe, or thow art but deed;\" and he ansuerde that sle hym he\nmyght wele; but ther-fore wolde he not yelde hym recreaunt\nwhile he myght lyve.  \"What, sir knyght,\" quod Gawein,\n\"sey ye this for trouthe that ye hadde leuer be deed than ye sholde yelde yow;\" and he seide, \"Ye, withoute\nfaile.\"  \"Trewly,\" seide Gawein, \"and I will not sle yow, for it were grete damage, for ye be full noble and worthi, but I shall\nmake yow to be so wele kept that this moneth ye shull not\ncome on horsbak.\"  \"I wote neuer,\" quod he, \"what ye\nwill do; but I will neuer graunte me for outreyed while that\nI may lyve.\"  Whan Gawein herde this, he saugh that he was\nof right high herte, and he be-thought hym on a fraunchise\nthat many oon wolde haue be full loth to haue do, and a-noon\nhe toke hym vp by the armes and seide, \"Sir knyght, haue\nhere my swerde, and I yelde me to yow as he that is outrayed;\"\nand whan Nascien saugh the grete gentilnesse that was in hym,\nhe was right gladde and seide, \"Ha, sir, I crye yow mercy,\nne sey not so, but holde here my swerde that I yow here yelde,\nfor alle peple se well I-nough how well it is; ffor this guerdon\nne may I yow quyte ne deserue, and than thei enbraced in\nbothe armes, bothe bachelers, and eche to other made grete\ncurtesye, and than returned bothe to-geder in to the turnement\nthat tho was well be-gonne, and Nascien turned vpon Gaweins\nside. Whan Gawein and Nascien com to the turnement thei\nfonde that Dodinell was remounted, and hadde\nwithholde Adragain be fyn force, and the stour was right stronge\nand merveilouse; and Seigramour hadde smyte down hervy de\nrivell, and hilde hym by the helme so harde with bothe hondes\nthat his feith be-hoved hym to yelde; and Gaheries hadde\ntaken Mygoras; and whan Gawein com he be-gan to do so\nwell, that alle thei be-hoved to forsake place, and Gaweins\nfelowes dide so wele, that the xl knyghtes of the rounde table\nhadde thei taken be strength, therefore were the tother full\nsory.  Than com in other xl all fressh, and than recouered\nto-geder alle the foure score felowes, and yaf hem a-newe\nenuaye, and com full sory and wroth for theire felowes that\nwere thus taken, and these other com and receyved hem at\nspere poyntes full boldly.  Ther was stronge stour and grete\nstrokes with swerdes vpon helmes and vpon sheldes, and longe it endured that oon cowde not sey whiche party hadde the\nwerse; and so lasted the medle till that mydday was passed,\nand than issed sir Gawein oute of the turnement to recouer\na-nother helme, for his was to rente that it was but litill worth\nto hym or to eny other; and as soone as he was newe helmed\nand hadde avented hym-self, he saugh how his felowes blenched\non alle partes, and than he rode in as faste as his horse myght\nrenne, and smote so the firste that he mette, that he fill from\nhis horse in to the feelde, and a-noon as he was comen his\nfelowes recouered that were in pointe to leve place, and he\nbe-gan to do so well that alle men merveiled that hym be-heilde,\nand fill that he fonde sir Ewein on foote, and kay, and Gefflet,\nand lucas, and Bliobleris, and Osenain cors hardy, and launall,\nand Agrauain; vpon these viij was all the turnement stinted;\nffor hem to take coveyted the knyghtes of the rounde table,\nand whan Gawein saugh that, he dressed thiderward his horse\nwith a spere in honde, and smote in a-monge hem so that thei\nfremyssh, and smote so the firste that he mette that he fill\nvp-right, and ther-with brake the spere that myght no lenger\nendure; and after that he overthrewe tweyne with the tronchon\nso felenoyusly that thei wiste not whethir it was nyght or\nday; and after that he drough his swerde and be-gan soche\nmaistries in armes that alle thei were a-baisshed, ffor he slitte\nsheldes, and hauberkes, and helmes, so that noon durste a-bide\nhis strokes, but made hym wey the beste of hem alle, and thei\ndisparbeled here and there, and his felowes ther-while be\nremounted, and haue goode will to ben a-venged; and than\nbe-gan sir Ewein to do so well that many were gladde hym to be-holden, and so diden alle the other companye that thei\nwere worthi to haue grete loos.  Thus endured the turnement\nfull longe, and wele thei diden in armes the newe knyghtes, and\nmerveilously hym preved ther sir Ewein, the sone of kynge\nVrien, and Galasshin, and Dodinell, and the viij felowes\na-fore-seide; these hielde hem vigerously be-fore alle the tother, and\nhem preised moche the foure kynges that weren vpon the walles,\nand seide thei sholde be noble men yef thei myght live to age: but a-bove alle other was sir Gawein comended, ffor thourgh\nhis prowesse thei were putte bakke and chaced to the town,\nand ther with-stode the knyghtes of the rounde table that were\nwroth and angry, and seiden amonge hem-self that foule were\nthei demened, and than thei returned a-gein hem that kepte hem\nwonder shorte; and than be-gan the stour so merveilouse and\nfierce more that it hadde ben of all the day at the enterynge\nof the yates of Torayse, be-twene the knyghtes of the rounde\ntable and the knyghtes that were newe a-dubbed, and ther\nbe-gan Gawein soche a disray that longe was it spoken of after;\nand yet hadde he don well all the day, ffor whan that he\nsaugh the knyghtes of the rounde table were stynted be-fore\nthe yate, and diffended so harde the entre he was sore chaffed\nfor anger.  Than he putte vp his swerde in the scawberk, but\nit was not Calibourne, but it was a-nother turneyinge swerde;\nand than he caught a sparre of Oke with bothe hondes, and\ncaste his shelde to the grounde for to be more light, and com\nin to the presse ther as he saugh thikkeste, and in his comynge\nhe smote a knyght on the helme that he fill in swownynge,\nand than he smote a-nother that he fill to grounde, and than\nhe leide on grete strokes on bothe sides that all that he raught\nvoided the sadeles that noon ne ascaped, and he hurte many\nand maymed; and whan the knyghtes of the rounde table\nsaugh that thei coveited nothinge but hem for to greve, and\nthan thei ronne vpon Gawein and his felowes, and seide that\nto-day more thei wolde not spare to do theire werste, and that\nof turneyinge hadde thei no more cure; and thei be-gonne ther\na stour grete and perilouse that grete myschef ther sholde haue\nben hastely, yef Merlin ne hadde cleped the kynge Ban, and the\nkynge Bohors his brother, and badde hem departe the\nturnement, for it was high tyme; and whan the barouns vndirstode\nthat Merlin seide, thei asked theire armes and theire horse\nhastely, and the squyres lepte wightly and brought hem be-fore\nthe paleise, and thei ride a-noon thourgh the renges, and Merlin\n rode formeste that sore hym hasted; and these foughten full\nharde, that sore were chauffed with wrath oon a-gein a-nother But Gawein dide moche harme with the sparre that was so\nharde, and thei hem diffended full vigerously, that in no wise\nwolde not voide the grounde; and whan Gawein saugh that\nthei mayntened hem so well he smote a-monge hem Irous as\na wilde boor, and perced hem thourgh-oute maugre hem alle;\nand than be-gan to do the werste that he myght hem to harmen\nat his power.  Than Merlin and the thre kynges com hem to\ndisseuer, and than fill that Gawein mette Meodalis that hadde\nsmyte hym with a spere in the breste, that ner he hadde smyte\ndown bothe hym and his horse on an hepe; and he was full\nwroth for the buffet that he hadde resceyved, and lifte up the\nbarre to smyte hym on the helme; and he saugh the stroke\ncome and blenched to eschewe the barre, but the stroke fill\nbe-twene the sholdres and smote hym down to the erthe; and\nthe kynge Arthur, that wele hadde seyn the stroke, cried pees,\nthat wele was vndirstonde of may oon, and cried a-lowde, \"Feire\nnevew, ley down the barre, for ye haue don right I-nowgh;\"\nand Merlin caught hym be that oon hande, and in that other\nhande toke the barre, and seide, smylinge, \"Sir knyght, thow\nart take yelde thow to me, for ye haue don I-nough.\" Than Gawein be-helde and saugh it was Merlin; than he\nseide full debonerly, \"I am take seth that it yow\npleseth, and ther-with he lete falle the barre, and than he\nasked why he dide hym take.\"  With that worde com the\nkynge Arthur, and seide, \"Gawein, feire nevewe, lefe the\nturnement, for ye haue don I-nowgh; ffor we se well that it is to be\nlefte.\"  And he ansuerde a-gein that so be it seth that he dide\n comaunde, and than tho v wente forth, and a-noon as Gawein\nwas oute thei departed and wente to theire hosteles for to\nvn-arme hem.  But full sory were the knyghtes of the rounde\ntable, for that thei hadde the werse by the chaunge that thei\nhadde made; and seiden than whan thei turneyed eny more,\nthei wolde so be a-venged that thei sholde not hem scorne ne\nIape, and that thei lete hem well wite the newe knyghtes and\nher companye.  These wordes well vndirstode a yonge knyght\nthat rode after hem, and tolde it to sir Gawein that Arthur and Merlin hadde brought to the paleise, and sir Ewein with\nhem, and Galasshin, and Seigramor; and whan this yonge\nknyght com he tolde as the knyghtes of the rounde table hadde\nseide, and Gawein vndirstode her manaces, and hir pride, and\nhe hadde ther-of grete dispite; but he made ther-of no semblance,\nsaf that he seide to his companye, that neuer he wolde hem\nfaile in no turnement ne in werre.  These wordes seide Gawein\nto his felowes, and he hilde it wele, ffor it was well shewed\nafter who was the beste knyght that day that thei toke\nturnement at logres in the medowes, as shall be reherseth whan\ntyme cometh; as soone as the turnement was departed, and\nthe kynge and his nevew were in the paleise, the knyghtes of\nthe rounde table wente to vn-arme hem at her ostels, and the\nmene peple of the town conveied I-nowgh sir Gawein, and seide\noon to a-nother, lo here the goode knyght, and thei gadered\na-boute hym on alle partes, and conveyed him to the paleise,\nand in to the halle, and thei asked oon of a-nother what he was;\nand Merlin hem ansuerde, and seide his name was Gawein,\nthe nevew of kynge Arthur, and the sone of kynge loot of\nOrcanye; and whan thei herden what he was, thei seiden as\ngladde peple that he shewed well fro whens he was comen,\nthus the peple of the town seiden her volunte, and than thei\nreturned; and whan the knyghtes of the rounde table were\nvn-armed, thei clothed hem and a-raide hem in her beste robes,\nand com to court; and where thei saugh sir Gawein, thei\ndrough a-boute hym and compleyned to hym of hym-self, and\nseide that he hadde hem euyll be seyn at that firste turnement,\nand that fro thens-forth he ought wele to be lorde and maister,\nand felowe of the rounde table; and Gawein hem herde wele,\nbut he ansuerde hem no worde, and fro thens-forth he was a\nlorde and maister, and a felowe of the rounde table; and it was\ngoode reson, ffor he was a noble knyght, and a trewe and full\nof alle vertues and goode tecches, and the moste curteise knyght\nthat eny man knewe. With that were the tables leide, and the knyghtes wash,\nand ther were thre halles full of knyghtes, and thei were well serued, and by leiser of alle thinges, and after soper\nwhan the clothes weren vp thei enuoysed the worthi knyghtes,\nand eche reported of other honour as was right, and than thei\nronge to euesonge in the mynster of seynt Stephene, and thider\nthei wente to here the seruise, and after was the bedde of\nArthur blessed as was right, and than departed the knyghtes,\nand wente to theire hostelles for to slepe and resten; and\nGonnore be-lefte in the Chamber, she and hir maistresse alone,\nand that day was purchesed the treson wherby she sholde\nbe taken and traied of the parentes of Gonnore, the stepdoughter\nof Cleodales the stiwarde, ffor thei hadde youen so moche to\nthe olde maistresse of Arthurs wife, that she graunted to do\ntheire volunte, and tolde hir thei wolde a-bide in the gardin\nvnder the paleise, and thei sholde haue the tother Gonnore in\nher companye; and all thus thei were a-corded and wente in-to\nthe gardin, and hidde hem vnder the trees x of hem; but thei\nwere not armed saf thei hadde eche of hem a suerde, and with\nhem was the false Gonnore, and ther thei a-bide so longe that\nthe barouns were departed to her hostels, and thei made dispoile\nthe quene to go to hir bedde; and than the old maistresse hir\ntoke and ledde hir in to the gardin for to pisse, and whan the\nx traitoris that were quatte in the gardin vnder an ympe saugh\nher come, thei were stille and coy, and drough towarde the\nwall litill and litill, and Bretell and Vlfin hadde not foryete\nthe wordes that Merlin hadde seide.  But were well armed\nvnder her robes, and weren quat vnder the steyres ther as the\nqueene sholde come down, and hilde hem so stille that thei\nwere not a-perceyued of man ne woman, and herkened in this\nmanere long while, and than thei saugh the queene that the\nmaistresse brought by the hande and wente that wey, where-as\nthe traitours hadde sette theire waicch, and whan thei saugh\nthat thei weren oute of the chambre, thei lepe vp and sette\nhande on hir, and toke to the old maistresse the tother false\nGonnore, and a-noon as the queene hem saugh she wiste well\nshe was be-traied, and wolde crye as she that was sore affraied,\nand thei seide that yef she spake eny worde she sholde a-non be slain, and ther-with thei drough theire swerdes oute and\nwente toward the river that ran vnder the gardin, where thei\nhadde a barge I-teyed where-in thei were come in to the gardin,\nand the gardin was right high a-bove the river, and noon myght\ncome ther-to but by a lane or by a barge, and the lane was\nfull thikke and comberouse to come vp or down for the rokkes,\nwherof was grete plente; and yef thei myght haue brought hir\nin to the barge the queene hadde ben loste with-oute recouer. Whan Vlfin and Bretell saugh that thei hadde so longe\na-wayted, thei lepte oute of theire enbusshement and\nhem a-scryed and cleped hem traitours, and seide thei sholde\ndye; and whan that the traitours saugh thei were but tweyne,\nand dide hem a-scrye, and preised hem at nought, than v of\nhem toke the queene, and v a-bode for to fight with the tweyne\nthat com with swerdes drawen; and whan the queene saugh\nhir ledde in soche manere, she hadde grete drede, and fill to\ngrounde vpon the grene, and thei lifte hir vp and bare hir a-wey\nmaugre hire; and whan she saugh tweyne come hir to socour,\nshe braied rudely oute of theire handes and down the gardin\ntill she com to an ympe, and clippe it in hir armes full harde\nand thise com for to take hir a-wey; but they myght not hir\nremeve, and yet thei pulde and drough, but more dide thei\nnought; and thei were nygh woode for sorowe and angre, that\nfor a litill thei wolde hir haue slayn, and Vlfin and Bretell\nbe come to these v that hem a-bide with swerdes drawen, and\nBretell smote so the firste that he mette that he slytte hym\nto the teth, and Vlfin smote a-nother that the heede fill to\ngrounde, and the other thre smyte at hem sore, but nought thei\nmyght hem apeire, for thei were well armed; and thei wolde\nhaue fledde, but thei kepte hem so shorte that alle thre there\nwere deed, and thei com to the tother fyve that peyned to lede\na-wey the quene by force, but thei myght not haue hir a-wey\nfrom the ympe, and thei plukked at hir so sore that nygh thei\nrente bothe armes from the body, and whan that Vlfin and\nBretell saugh the queene in soche turnement, thei ronne thider,\nand hem a-scried, and a-noon thei com hem a-geins, and yaf to-geder grete strokes with swerdes ther as thei myght atteyne,\nthat thei slowgh tweyne of the v; and thei saugh thei were\nbut thre, and thei turned to flight down the lane towarde the\nbarge; and whan Vlfin and Bretell saugh hem fleen thei sette\nno force hem to enchace, but com to the olde deuell, the\nmaistresse, and caught hir by the sholderes, and caste hir down\nthe roche, and rolled fro roche to roche till she com to the\nriver, and than thei caste in the bodyes of alle hem that thei\nhadde slayn, and than thei toke the queene and ledde hir to\nhir chambre sore affraied, and thei badde hir be nothinge be\ndismayed.  Than thei toke the false Gonnore and ledde hir to\ntheire hostell, for thei wolde that noon aparceyved her covyne. Thus as ye haue herde were the traitours demened by the\ncounseile of Merlin, and the Queene was socoured by\nthese two worthi men; and as soone as thei were gon, a-noon\nMerlin it knewe well, and than he badde the kynge sende two\nmaydenes in to the chamber to the queene for to bringe hir to\nbedde, and the kynge asked wherefore is ther not I-nowgh of\nthe maistresse, and Merlin tolde hym the trouthe all as it was\nbe-fallen; and whan the kynge it herde he merveiled moche\nof this thinge, and seide he sholde not be in ese till he hadde\nspoken with his doughter; and than departed the kynge leodogan\nand com in to the chamber where-as Gonnore his doughter\nwas, and brought with hym two maydenes to helpe hir to\nbedde; and whan she saugh hir fader she be-gan tenderly to\nwepe, and the kynge toke hir by the hande, and spake with\nhir sooll by hir-self, and he badde hir not to be dismayed, for\nshe sholde no more haue no drede, and she tolde hym all the\nauenture that was be-fallen; and than the kynge comaunded\nthe maydenes to make hir redy, and bringe hir to bedde, and\nthei a-noon dide his comaundement, and the kynge leodogan\nwolde neuer departe oute of the chambre till that he saugh\nthe signe of the crowne vpon hire reynes; and than wiste he\nverily that it was his doughter vpon his wif, and than he\ncouered hir a-gein, a wente oute of the chambre and spake no\nworde; and the dameseiles merveiled sore whi that he dide so, and than com the kynge Arthur and his companye from\ntheire disporte, and whan he com in to the halle, the kynge\nLeodogan and Merlin com hym a-geins, and badde hym go to\nhis wif to bedde, ffor it was reson and high tyme, and he\nseide he wolde with good will, and com in to the chambre\nwhere the two maidenes weren that hadde brought the queene\nto bedde, and as soone as he was in his bedde thei departed\noute of the chambre, and lefte no moo but hem two, and ther\nthei ledde myri lif togeder as thei that well loued. Thus sholde the queene haue be disceyued be these traitours,\nand thourgh hem after-ward hadde she grete annoye that\nlonge tyme endured, as the storye shall declare how that the\nkynge hir lefte thre yer, that she com neuer in his companye;\nbut was with Galehaut, a riche prince in the reame of Sorloys,\nfor the love of launcelot; and the kynge Arthur hilde in\na-voutrye the false Gonnore till that a maladie hir toke, and\nBertelak, a traitour, that made he wolde hir not forsake for\nno man, till that she stanke and rotened a-bove erthe, and the\nreame was therfore nygh thre yere enderdited, and stode a-cursed\nthat neuer manes body ne womans was byried in noon halowed\nplace, but a-cursed be the centense of holy cherche, and all\nthis trouble suffred oure lorde hem for to haue for his synnes\nthat were right grete, and all this com thourgh a knyght that\ndied after vpon myschevouse deth, as ye shull here declared\nin the seconde book of this storie, and it is reson to telle what\nwas the cause that it fill. This was the trouthe that the kynge leodogan was a noble\nknyght, and kepte well Iustice and right, and he\nhadde with hym a wise knyght that hadde don hym goode\nservise; and he was come of high lynage, and hadde be a\ngoode knyght in his tyme, and was cleped Bertelak, and he\nhated a knyght dedly, for that he hadde slayn his cosin germain\nfor his wif, that he loved, and whan Bertelak wiste that he\nhadde his cosin slain, and his wif diffouled, he ne deyned not\nto make no playnt to the kynge leodogan, but com to hym and\nhym diffied, and a-waited hym after many a day and many a nyght; and it fill that same even that arthur hadde wedded\nhis wif that the knyghtes departeden for the court, and wente\nto theire hostels, and happed that Bertelak mette that knyght\nand with hym two squyers, and a-noon Bertelak ran vpon hym\nand hym slowgh; and whan he hadde don he wente to his\nhostell, and the two squyers that were with the knyght made\na grete crie, that the peple ronne oute on alle parties with\nlanternes, and brondes of fire, and torches brennynge, and fonde\nthe knyght slayn, and thei aske the two squyers that made so\ngrete doell who hadde hym slain; and thei seide that Bertelak\nthe rede hadde it don, and whan the squyers hadde cried and\nbraied for theire lord longe while, thei toke hym vp and bar\nhym to theire hostell, and dide hym birie as oon sholde do\na deed knyght, and dide the seruise at cherche as ther-to\nbelonged; and on the morowe Vlfin and Bretell sente after\nCleodalis, the stiward, for to come speke with hem in her hostell,\nand he com a-noon with goode chere as fre and debonair, and\na-noon as he was comen, thei toke hym in counseile, and tolde\nhym all the a-uenture as it was be-fallen how his doughter\nhadde wrought; and whan he hadde herde the vntrouthe of\nhire he seide his doughter was she not, ffor yef she hadde be\nmy doughter she hadde not don this for no-thinge that is in\nthe erthe; and as thei spake to-geder a-monge hem thre.  The\nkynge leodogan was a-risen erly, ffor sore was he affraied of\nthe merveiles that were be-falle that nyght of his doughter,\nand Merlin was also a-risen, and seide, \"Sir, god yeve yow\ngoode morowe;\" and whan the kynge hym saugh he made\nhym feire chere, and bad god hym blisse.  Than eche toke other\nbe the hande, and wente spekynge of many thinges till thei\ncom to the hostell of Vlfin and Bretell, and thei entred in so\nstilliche that thei ther-of wiste no worde till thei were euen\ncomen vpon hem, and a-noon as thei were of hem war, thei\nyede hem a-geins as thei that nothinge were a-baisshed to\nworship eny worthi man.  Than thei entred in to a chambre alle\nv, and Vlfin brought forth Gonnore, and tolde how she and\nthe traitours hadde wrought, not-with-stondinge thei knewe it alle wele, for Merlin hadde it tolde the kynge all as it\nwas.  Than spake the kinge leodogan to his stiwarde, and seide,\n\"Sir, Senescall, I love yow well, and fayn I wolde purchace\nyoure worshippe for to encrece, and so I shall do yef I may lyve;\nffor full well ye haue me serued and trewly, and therfore\nwolde I do nothinge that sholde yow turne to shame or reprof,\nand witte ye wherfore I it sey.  Se here youre doughter that\nwele hath deserued that ther sholde be don on hir\nIustice.  But ye haue be so trewe to me that I ought it wele to pardon\nfor the love of yow, or a gretter thinge than is this.  But for\nthat me be-hoveth for to take vengaunce in some manere, hit\nbe-houeth yow to bringe hir oute of this reame In soche wise\nthat neuer she be sein of man ne of woman that hir knowe;\nffor so I will that it be don;\" and the stiwarde ansuerde and\nseide that his doughter ne was she neuer.  But in as moche as\nit was his wille and his comaundement he wolde hit don, \"ffor\nso god helpe me,\" quod he, \"I hadde leuer she hadde be biried\nall quyk than this hadde hir be-fallen.  Ne to me she ne\naperteyned nothinge neuer.\"  \"Now,\" quod the kynge, \"lete\nbe all this matier, and loke that it be don in soche maner that\nI neuer here more speche of hir here-after, and that ye take\nof myne what that is youre plesier.\" Thus was take the counseile of the Barouns, and Cleodalis\nappareiled hym and his stepdoughter to go with-outen\nlenger respite, and rode forth by theire iourneyes till thei com\noute of the reame of Carmelide in to an abbey that stode in a\nfull wilde place, and ther he hir lefte, as seith the storie, till\nthat Bertelak the reade hir fonde, whiche by his art and his\nengyn by hir lay longe tyme after.  But of hir as now speketh\nno more the tale saf that Cleodalis lefte hir there, and come\na-gein to Toraise in to the grete Court of the kynge leodogan\nin Carmelide, wher-as was the kynge Arthur.", "25": "CHAPTER XXVI. BANISHMENT OF BERTELAK; FIGHT AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ARTHUR AND LOOT; ARTHUR'S COURT AT LOGRES; VOWS OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE AND THE QUEEN'S KNIGHTS; THE TOURNAMENT. Whan the kynge leodogan hadde comaunded his stiwarde to\nbringe his stepdoughter oute of the reame, he and Merlin\ndeparted from Vlfin and Bretell, and com in to the halle hande\nto hande, where thei fonde the Barouns alle redy, and oon hadde\nronge to masse, and so thei wente to the mynster, and whan\nmasse was seide thei com a-gein in to the halle, and than com\nthe kyn of the deed knyght that Bertelak hadde slain, ffor to\nmake theire complainte to the kynge; and the kynge leodogan\nsente for to seche hym at his hostell, and he com a-noon\nwith-oute daunger well armed vndir his robes, and brought with\nhym grete plente of knyghtes, ffor he was full of feire courtesie\nand a feire speker, and a-noon the kynge hym asked why he\nhadde the knyght slain in treson, and he seide that of treson\nhe sholde hym wele diffende a-gein alle tho that wolde hym\napele, \"and I sey no nay but that I slough the knyght, but\nfirste I dide hym deffie, and it was not with-oute grete cause,\nffor moche peple knowe wele that he slough my cosin germain\nfor his wif that he diffouled, and me semeth that in alle\nmaners that oon may oweth he to greve his mortall enmye\nafter that he hath hym diffied;\" and the kynge seide that that\nwas not I-nough.  \"But yef ye hadde yow complayneth to me,\nand I wolde not haue it redressed than myght ye haue take\nvengaunce, but ye ne spake ther-of to me neuer\nworde.\"  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"ye sey your volunte.

At this Iugement was the kynge Arthur, and the kynge\nBan, and the kynge Bohors, and sir Gawein, and sir\nEwein, and Galasshin, and Nascien, and Adragain, and hervy\nde rivel, and Guyomar.  These x were at the Iugement and\nspake to-geder of oon thinge and other, and thei a-corded in the\nende that he sholde be disherited, and voyde the londe of the\nkynge leodogan for euer more; and the kynge Ban that was\nof feire eloquense tolde the tale as he was charged, and he\nspake so high that he myght wele be herde, bothe of nygh and\nfer.  \"Sirs,\" quod he, \"these barouns that beth here a-warded\nthat Bertelais le Rous shall be disherited of all his londe that\nhe holdeth in youre powere, and shall for-swhere the contre\nfor euer more; ffor that he toke the Iustice vpon hym-self of\nthe knyght that he slough, and namly by nyght, ffor the\nIustice longed not to hym, and on that other side ye holde\ncourt open and myghty that oweth to condite alle saf goynge\nand saf comynge to alle tho that come at this high feste,\" and\nwith that sat down the kynge Ban that no more seide at that\ntyme; and whan Bertelays saugh he was for-Iuged, and that\nhe ne myght noon othirwise do he returned with-oute moo\nwordes; ffor he durste not the Iugement with-sey, ffor the\nhighest lordes of the worlde, and the moste puyssaunt hadde\nit don.  But yef eny other hadde it don a-noon he wolde the\nIugement haue falsed, and thus wente Bertelais le Rous, but\nmany a knyght hadde he hym to conueye to whom he hadde\nyoven many feire yeftes, ffor he hadde be a noble knyght and\na vigerouse, and so he past forth on his iourneyes that he com\nto the same abbey, wher-as was the false Gonnore, and ther\nhe a-bode and soiourned longe tyme, and was in grete thought\nas he that cowde moche euell, how that he myght be a-venged\nof the kynge leodogan and the kynge Arthur that hadde hym\nthus for-juged, and for that fill to Arthur grete trouble and so\ngrete discorde be-twene hym and his wif, that he lefte her\nlonge tyme, as ye shull here in the secunde book of this processe\nyef god will vouche-saf to graunte me so longe space to writen\nit.  But now we moste cesse of this mater, and speke of the goode kynge Arthur that is at Toraise, in Carmelide, with the\nkynge leodogan, and with the grete companye. Full myry lif ledde the kynge Arthur with his wif viij\ndayes, and the neynthe day after that he was spoused\nhe cleped his Barouns, and badde hem make hem redy to ride,\nffor he was in talent for to repeire in to the reame of logres,\nand thei seide that thei were all redy for to ride; and than the\nkynge toke Gawein in counseile, and seide, \"Ffeire nevew,\ntake with yow as many of youre companye that ther leve here\nbut v hundred, ffor I will come ride after stilleche and esely,\nand ye shall go to logres my chief Citee, and ordeyne redy alle\nthinges that is necessarie, and of vitaile, and of deynteis, as ye\nmay so that nothinge ne faute, and sendith fer and nygh that\nI will holde court this mydde August the richest that I\nmay.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Gawein, \"I haue drede lest ye be encombred be\nthe wey of some maner peple.\"  \"Of that haue ye no drede,\"\nquod the kynge, \"but go ye in all haste.\"  Than departed\nsir Gawein from his vncle and com to his felowes, and bad hem\nto make hem redy for to ride, and thei wente to theire hostelles,\nand hem armed; but firste thei toke leve of the kynge leodogan,\nand of the Barouns of Carmelide, and thus departed Gawein\nfro the courte, he and his companye; and the kynge Arthur\na-bode with v hundre men, whereof two hundre and fifty were\nknyghtes of the rounde table; and Gawein and his companye\ncom to logres; but Gawein was euer pensif for his vncle that\nhe hadde lefte in Carmelide, that hym sholde eny thinge\nmyshappe vpon the wey, ffor he hadde fer contrey to ride that\nmarched to his enmyes er he com in to his londe in safte, and\nhe hym hasted to do the kynges comaundement, and sent to\nalle hem that the kynge loved that thei sholde come to his\nCourt at the myddell of August, and eche made hym redy to\ncome to court as strongely as thei myght, and Gawein ordeyned that vitaile com on alle parties with cartes and Chariettis that\nhe stuffed so well the Citee as longed to soche a feste, as he that full well coude hym entermete that nothinge ne failed;\nffor as the storye seith he was oon of the beste knyghtes, and\nwiseste of the worlde, and ther-to the leste mysspeker, and\nnoon a-vauntor, and the beste taught of alle thinges that\nlongeth to worshippe or curtesie; and whan he hadde made all\nredy he toke his wey toward his vncle, ffor grete drede he\nhadde of that he sholde be distrobeled on the wey of som\npeple.  But now we shull a-while cesse of hym and his\ncompanye, and speke of the kynge Arthur. The thridde day after that Gawein was departed from the\nkynge Arthur his vncle, the kynge toke his wey towarde\nthe Castell of Bredigan, he and his wif, and in her companye\nwas the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and the kynge Bohors of Gannes\nthat was his brother, and the beste knyght that eny man neded\nto seche, and so ther were CCL knyghtes of the rounde table that\nalle were feed men with the kynge leodogan, and the queene\nhadde so praied sir Amnistian that was chapelein with the kynge\nleodogan hir fader, that he com with hir, and was sithen hir\nchapelein longe tyme; and so ledde Gonnore hir cosin that was\nfeire, and debonaire, and amyable to alle peple, and Sadoyne\nhir brother that was elther than she, and Castelein of\nDaneblaise, the noble Citee; and as soone as the kynge Arthur\nwas departed oute of the reame of Carmelide, the kynge loot\nhadde knowinge by his asspies, and he and his knyghtes rode\na-gein hym, and hem enbusshed in the foreste of sapernye, and\nseide that ther sholde he a-bide the kynge Arthur, and take\nfrom hym his wif, yef he myght.  But of hym we shull now\ncesse, and speke of the kynge Arthur that was departed oute\nof Carmelide, and the storie seith how the kynge leodogan\nconveyed hem thre dayes hole, and the fourthe day he returned\nin to his reame, and than com Merlin to the kynge Arthur\nand toke leve, and seide that he sholde go to his maister\nBlaase, for longe hadde he hym not seyn, and the kynge hadde\nwell spedde of that he hadde for to done.  Than seide the\nkynge, \"Merlin, feire frende shull ye not be at my court at\nlogres?\"  \"Yesse,\" seide Merlin, \"I shall be ther er it departe,\" and ther-with eche of hem comaunded other to god,\nbut he was but litill wey thens whan no man wiste where\nthat he was be-comen; and Merlin wente to Blaase the same\nnyght, and he hym resceyued with grete ioye, whan that he\nhym saugh, and Merlin tolde hym alle the a-uentures that were\nfalle seth that he departed, and he tolde hym how the kynge\nloot was enbusshed in the foreste of sapernye, and tolde hym\nother thinges I-nowghe that after be-fill in the reame of logres;\nand Blaase hem wrote as he tolde, and by his booke haue we\nthe knowinge; but now cesseth to speke of Merlin, and Blase,\nand speke of Arthur. Whan the kynge Arthur was departed from the kynge\nleodogan, and Merlin also, as ye haue herde, he rode\nwith v hundre men of armes, and ledde with hym his wif\nGonnore the queene, and he rode smale iourneyes till he com\nin to the foreste of sapernye, where-as the kynge loot was\nenbusshed with vij hundre men of armes; and the gromes\nthat ledde the somers wiste neuer worde till that thei were\nfallen euen a-monge hem; and as soone as thei saugh thei were\nmen of armes, thei wiste well thei were not well come.  Than\nthei a-bode and wente no ferther, and sente to the kynge Arthur\nthat thei hadde founde men I-armed; whan the kynge saugh\nthat he was a-spied he a-light on foote, and made his peple\ncome a-boute hym and ordeyned for bataile, and comaunded\nxl. knyghtes to kepe the queene, and bad hem lede hir to\ngarison yef thei saugh nede.  And than thei ride forth her\nheedes bowed down vndir theire helmes redy hem to diffende,\nyef thei founde eny peple to stoppe hem the wey, and so thei\nride till thei dide falle vpon the wacche, and the kynge Arthur\nwas be-fore in the firste frounte, and the kynge Ban, and the\nkynge Bohors, and the knyghtes of the rounde table; and the\nkynge looth spronge oute with vij hundre men of armes, and\ncom hem a-geins theire spers, a-gein the assels of the sadeles,\nand the sheldes be-fore theire breste as faste as horse myght\nrenne, and hem a-scride so high that all the foreste resounded,\nand these other com vpon hem boldely with sharpe trenchaunte speres, and mette to-geder vpon sheldes that many of hem\nperced and slitte, many were throwe to grounde on bothe sides,\nand many ther were that brake theire speres and passed forth\nwith-oute fallinge; and whan the spers were spente thei drowgh\noute theire swerdes and be-gonne the bateile right grete, that\nneuer of so fewe peple ne saugh no man so fierce bateile, ffor\nthei were full noble knyghtes vpon bothe parties; and so longe\nit lasted, that the kynge Arthur and the kynge looth mette\nto-geder with speres in hande, and lett renne that oon a-gein\nthat other so harde as horse myght renne, and mette so harde\nto-geder with speres vpon sheldes, that the spere poyntes stynte\nat the hauberkes, and thei ther-on shof with all theire force;\nand the kynge loot brake his spere, and the kynge Arthur\nsmote hym so harde that he bar hym to grounde ouer his\nhorse croupe; but soone was he lepte vpon foote as he that\nwas of grete prowesse, and drowh his swerde and couered hym\nwith his shelde, and was so doelfull that nygh he yede oute\nof witte, ffor that he was overthrowe be the myght of knyght\nalone, ffor he was not a-customed for to falle often; and the\nkynge Arthur hadde made his returne and com toward the\nkynge loot gripinge his spere, for he coveited to take hym\nquyk; and whan the kynge looth saugh hym come he glenched\na-side, and Arthur failed of hym and past forth, and in the\npassinge the kynge loot smote Arthurs horse in the bely thourgh\nthe guttes, and Arthur fill to grounde, and his horse vpon\nhis body, that his thigh was be-twene the horse and the grounde,\nso that he myght not a-rise; and the kynge loot sterte to and\ncaught hym by the helme, and drough and pulled all that he\nmyght, and sore hym peyned for to smyten of his heede, and\nsoone ther sholde haue be so grete damage that neuer myght it\nhaue be restored; but as the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors,\nand the knyghtes of the rounde table com fiercely vpon the\npeple of kynge loot, and be-gan sore bateile and harde, so that\nther was noon but that he hadde I-nough to done; and so thei\npeyned hem on bothe parties that the two kynges be remounted,\nand be-gonne the stour grete and merveillouse; but at grete myschef were the peple of kynge Arthur, ffor the kynge loot\nhadde two hundre knyghtes moo than hadde kynge Arthur;\nwith that com sir Gawein with foure score felowes well armed,\nand kay the stiwarde bar the baner; and Arthur be-hielde and\nsaugh Gawein come and knewe hym well by his armes, and\nalso kay the stiwarde be the baner that he bar in his handes\nthat sore desired the assemble, as he that was hardy and\nenterpendaunt, and right sure ne hadde ben oon tecche that he\nhadde, ffor that he was copiouse of langage in his disporte for\nthe iolynesse that was in hym and the myrthe; for he was euer\nbourdinge and iapinge in game, and was the beste felowe in\ncompanye that eny man knewe, and for that euer he wolde of\ncustome borde of the sothe hym hated many a knyght for the\nshame that thei hadde of his wordes, and therfore he myshapped\nin many a place, ffor the knyghtes that he hadde scorned in\nmyrthe didde hym after grete annoye; but a trewe knyght was\nhe euer a-gein his lorde, and a-gein the queene, euer in to the\nende of his deth.  Ne neuer in all his live dide he treson saf\noon, and that was of lohoot the sone of kynge Arthur that he\nslough for enuye in the foreste perilouse, and for that Percevale\nly Galoys was accused with grete wronge for the deth of the\nsame hoot, like as an Ermyte hit tolde after that hadde seyn\nall the dede.

And whan Gawein vndirstode the shoute and the crye\nthat was vpon his felowes, he be-helde and saugh hem\nat grete myscheif, and that for thought hym right sore, and\nseide to sir Ewein, \"A-voy, cosin, we haue taried to\nlonge.\"  \"Ewein\" now quod Segramor, \"neuer be he holde for a\nknyght that faileth to helpe at this nede.\"  \"I preise not at\na boton,\" quod Gifflet, \"the speche, but the dede be\nshewed.

With that were the knyghtes of the rounde table come\nbe-fore the kynge, and as soone as thei were come\nthei kneled to sir Gawein, and folded the panes of her mantels;\nand than spake hervy de rivell, \"Sir, we shull a-mende to yow\nfor vs, and for oure felowes alle these thinges with-oute more\nseyinge, wher-of we haue a-gein yow mystaken, wher-fore we\nbe-seche yow of pardon;\" and sir Gawein lept vp on foote and\nseide he pardoned hem alle forfetes, and reised hem by the\narmes, and so dide Ewein, and Segramor, and the thre brethren\nof Gawein, eche of hem reised a knyght, and made alle the\nreuenaunt to stonde vp and a-coled eche other in armes, and\nforyaf all wrath and maltalent, and fro thens-forth was sir Gawein a lorde and a maister and felowe of the rounde table; and the\nquene quyte cleymed the x knyghtes that were prisoners that\nhir knyghtes hadde her sent, and yaf eche of hem newe robes\nand fressh.

THE MISSION OF KING LOOTH AND HIS FOUR SONS TO MAKE TRUCE WITH THE REBEL KINGS; AND THEIR BATTLES WITH THE SAXONS. This was the trouthe that tidinges spredde thourgh the reame\nof grete Breteigne of the seint Graal, In the whiche\nIoseph ab Aramathie hadde geten the holy blode that dropped\noute of the side of oure blissed lorde Ieshu crist whan he henge\non the gloriouse crosse, he and Nichodemus, and the holy vessell\nthat com from heuene a-bove in the Citee of Sarras.  In the\nwhiche he sacrefied first his blissid body and his flessh by his\nBisshoppe Iosephe that he sacred with his owene hande, and\nthe holy spere, the whiche Ieshu the sone of marie his side\nwas with opened, was left in the Cite of Logres that Ioseph\nthider hadde brought.  But noon cowde wite in what place, ne neuer ne shall, neuer be founde but by prophesie ne the\nmerveiles of the seint graal, ne of the spere that thourgh the poynte\nof Iren dide blede.  Till that the beste knyght of the worlde\ncom, and by hym sholde be discouered the merveiles of the\nseint Graal, and herde and seyn.  These tidinges were spredde\nall a-boute in euery contrey, and so no man cowde neuer wite\nwho sholde it bringe first forth, and whan the companye of the\nrounde table herde sey that thourgh the beste knyght of the\nworlde these thinges sholde be brought to fin.  Thei entred\nin to many questes for to knowe whiche was the beste knyght,\nand serched many a londe and many a contrey, and eche man\nhym peyned for to be the beste knyght; and whan thei herde\nspeke that ther was eny goode knyght thourgh the contrey,\nthei entred in to a quest hym to seche a yere and a day\nwith-oute soiour in a town more than oon nyght, and whan thei\nhadde hym founde, thei sholde bringe hym to court; and whan\nhe was well preved of goode recorde that he was of high\nprowesse thei toke hym in to her companye, and than was his\nname writen a-monge the other knyghtes that were felowes of\nthe rounde table; and as eche of hem com from his quest at the\nyeres ende, thei sholde telle the auentures that were hem\nbe-fallen in theire traueile, and the clerkes that were therfore\nI-ordeyned it wrote worde for worde, euen as thei tolde.  Now\nhaue ye herde why the questes were stablisshed in the reame of\nthe grete Breteigne.  But now repeireth the tale to his mater\nthat he hath lefte for to telle this thinge, that I wolde that it\nwere not for-getyn. Full gladde and iocounde were the companye of the rounde\ntable for that thei were a-corded with sir Gawein, and\nfull moche thei hym preised and comended for the grete\nprowesse that thei saugh hym do at this turnement, and seide\na-monge hem in counseile that the beste knyghtes ther-ynne\nsholde not a-gein hym endure body for body.  Thus the\nknyghtes ther-ynne seide theire volunte.  But moche more spake the ladyes and the maydenes in the chambers.  Than\nwas water asked, and whan thei hadde waisshen than sat euery knyght as hym ought for to do, and the quenes knyghtes were\nsette by the knyghtes of the rounde table, and the kynge\nArthur, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and the\nkynge looth sat at the high deyse as thei ought for to do, and\nmo sat ther not but thei foure, and that day serued Gawein\nand kay the stiward, and lucas the botiller, and Gifflet, and\nother a-boute a xl., and were so well served that noon cowde\nbetter devise, as of mees that thei hadde it nedeth not to reherse,\nne of the wynes and drinkes that thei hadde in maners, and\nafter the bordes were vp the knyghtes yede to disporte hem in\nthe medowes vpon the river, ffor it was feire weder and\nclier.

But who that\ndeparted, Gyomar ne departed neuer but a-bode spekynge with\nMorgain, the sustur of kynge Arthur, in a wardrope vnder\nthe paleys, where she wrought with silke and golde; ffor she\nwolde make a coyf for his suster, the wif of kynge looth.  This\nMorgain was a yonge damesell fressh and Iolye.  But she was\nsom-what brown of visage and sangwein colour, and nother to\nfatte ne to lene, but was full a-pert auenaunt and comely,\nstreight and right plesaunt, and well syngynge.  But she was\nthe moste hotest woman of all Breteigne, and moste luxuriouse, and she was a noble clergesse, and of Astronomye cowde she\nI-nough, for Merlin hadde hir taught; and after he lerned hir\nI-nough as ye shull heren afterward, and so moche she sette\nther-on hir entent, and lerned so moche of egramauncye, that\nthe peple cleped hir afterward Morgain le fee, the suster of\nkynge Arthur; ffor the merveiles that she dide after in the\ncontrey, and the beste workewoman she was with hir handes,\nthat eny man knewe in eny londe, and ther-to she hadde oon\nof the ffeirest heed, and the feirest handes vnder hevene, and\nsholdres well shapen at devise; and she hadde feire eloquense,\nand tretable, and full debonair she was as longe as she was\nin hir right witte, and whan she were wroth with eny man,\nshe was euell for to acorde; and that was well shewed\nafterward, ffor hir that she sholde most haue loved of all the\nworlde dide she after the moste shame, wherof it was after\nalle the dayes of hir lif, and that was the quene Gonnore, as\nthat ye shull it heren here-after and wher-fore it was. Whan Guyomar entred in to the chambre ther as was\nMorgain the ffee, he hir salued full swetly, and she\nhym salued a-gein curteisly, and he sette hym down by hir\nand helped to wynde the threde of golde, and asked hir what\nshe sholde ther-with make, and he was a feire knyght and\ncomly, well shapen, and his visage well coloured, and his heer\ncrull and yelowe, and was feire and plesaunt of body and of\nchere laughinge, and he a-resoned hir of many thinges; and\nshe be-hielde hym gladly, and was well plesed with all that\nhe seide and dide; and so longe thei spake to-geder that he\npraied hir of love, and the more that she hym be-hilde, the\nbetter she was with hym plesed, and that she gan love hym so\nwell that she refused nothinge that he wolde hir require; and\nwhan he aperceyued that she wolde suffre gladly his requeste,\nhe be-gan hir to enbrace, and she hym suffred, and he be-gan\nto kysse hir tendirly that bothe thei be-gonne to chauffe as\nnature wolde, and fellen down on a grete bedde, and pleyde\nthe comen pley, as thei that gretly it desired; ffor yef he were\ndesirouse she was yet moche more, so that thei loved hertely to-geder longe tyme that noon it wiste; but after it knewe the\nquene Gonnore as ye shull here telle, wherfore thei were\ndeparted, and ther-fore she hated the quene, and dide hir after\ngret annoye, and of blames that she areised that euer endured\nwhile hir lif lasted.  But now retourne we to kynge looth and\nhis sones that be go to slepe. A noon as it was past mydnyght a-roos the kynge Looth\nand his foure sones, and appareiled hem of hir armours;\nand thei hadde chosen v of the beste horse that thei cowde\nfynde in all the court, and hem thei made to be ledde with\nhem with v gromes on foote, and thei hadde v palfreyes right\ngoode that thei dide ride on hir iourney; and whan thei were\nall redy thei lept on theire palfreyes, and ride oute at the yat\nof Bertone and the v gromes wente be-fore and ledde the v\nhorse couered with steill, and wente oute as softly as thei\nmyght, for thei wolde not be a-parceyved of no peple; and whan\nthei hadde riden half a walsh myle, Gawein asked whiche wey\nthei sholde go; and the kynge looth seide he wiste not, for the\ncontrey was full of werre.  \"Than shall I telle yow,\" quod\nGawein, \"what we shull do; we shull go to Arestuell in\nScotlonde that is now the next londe, and moste full of wode of\nall this contrey, and it is better to drawe that wey than to eny\nother place;\" and the kynge looth seide, \"Feire sone, seth\nthat it pleseth yow I will wele, for youre counseile is goode,\nand so shull we go be the castell of Sapine and be the playn\nof Reostok, and by the foreste of lespinoye vnder Carenges,\nand we shull go by the river of Savarne, and thourgh the\nplaynes of Cambenyk, and fro thens we shull costinge to the\nCite of North walis that longeth to the kynge Tradilyuaunt,\nand fro thens to Arestuell, iiij myle from the Saisnes;\" and\nthe children herto dide graunte. Thus ride thise messagiers, spekynge of o thinge and other,\ntill it was day, and on the morowe thei rode be the\nmoste vncouthe weyes that thei cowde knowe, and lay in the\nforestes, and in hermytages, and thus thei ride viij dayes that\nneuer hadde thei disturbier till thei com in to the playns of Roestok, and than it be-fill hem a-boute the hour of mydday\nthat thei mette vij Ml Saisnes that brought grete prayes and\nas vii C prisoners, that the feet were bounde vnder the horse\nbelies, and thei dide hem beete full lothly with staves and\nother wepnes, and hem dide condite Sorbares, and Monaclyns,\nand Salebruns, and Ysores, and Clarion.  This Clarion rode on\nGringalet, an horse that was cleped so far the grete bounte that\nhe hadde; ffor as the storye seith for x myle rennynge abated\nhe neuer his corage, ne hym neded no spore ne no skyn of hym\nther-fore ne sholde not swete; and whan the saisnes hem saugh\nridinge on her weye, thei knewe well by theire armes and hir\nconysshaunce that thei were noon of her companye, and thei\nhoved and a-bode; and whan Gawein saugh that, he hoved stille\nand bad his fader and his brethren to lepe vpon theire horses,\nand so thei dide a-noon delyuerly; and the gromes toke the\npalfreys and lepte vp and rode in to the foreste that wey\nstreight as theire wey turned, and thei com toward the saisnes\nas the wey hem ledde, for thei deyned not to glenche; and\nmydday was than passed, and drough towarde noone, and so\nrode the kynge looth formest, and Gawein after, and his brethern\nhym be-side, a softe paas; and whan thei hadde so riden that\nthei be-gan to come nygh, than seide Gawein to his fader that\nhe ne sholde entende to noon other thinge ne coveite but to\nperce hem thourgh-out, and to his brethern he seide the same\ntill thei were come on that other side.  Than the saisnes hem\nascride, and seide, \"Ye knyghtes that come ther, yelde yow\nand telle vs what ye be and what ye go sechinge;\" and the\nkynge looth ansuerde, \"We ben fyve messagiers of the kynge\nArthur that go on his erunde ther he hath vs sente, and more\nwill we not sey;\" and thei seide, \"Cesse and go no ferther;\nffor we kepe the weyes in the name of the kynge hardogabran,\nand Orienx the sone of Brangue of Saxoyne, and in the name\nof Margrat, to whom we lede this pray and these prisoners,\nand of yow also shull we make present.\"  \"Ye,\" quod the\nkynge looth, \"whan ye may;\" and thei seide in to that tyme was\nbut litill space.  \"But yelde yow, and than do ye wisely er it falle yow eny werse;\" and thei ansuerde that sholde neuer\nbe.  Than thei lete theire horse renne with as grete randon as thei\nmyght go, and these a-gein to hem that nothinge hem ne douted,\nbut smote in a-monge hem, and eche of hem bar oon deed to\nthe erthe, and after smote other v that thei were deed vp-right;\nand at foure cours thei haue hem perced thourgh with-oute\neny other discombraunce, and than thei ride a walop with theire\nsperes in theire handes all blody; and whan the saisnes saugh\nhem goinge, than a-roos the shoute and the noyse after hem\nright grete, and be-gonne hem to chace that the duste a-roos so\nthikke that harde it was oon to knowe a-nother; with that\ncom the vj kynges prikinge after, that hadde herde the tidinges\nand cried vpon her men, \"Now upon hem and lete hem yow not\nascape;\" and thei hem-self priken after, for thei were well horsed,\nand so thei chaced hem fiercely, and thei wente forth a grete\nwalop till thei be come to a Mille, where ther was a passage\nat a forde full of cley, and ther moste thei stinte and ride\na softe paas; and ther ouer-toke hem the v kynges that dred\nnothinge the euell passage, and of saisnes after hem mo than\nv C , and ther thei brake theire speres vpon hem in her comynge,\nand Ysors that com be-fore smote the horse of kynge looth that\nhe fill deed be-twene his legges. Whan the kynge looth saugh his horse slain he lept vp\nlightly on his feet, and drough his swerde, and drough\nhym to a banke for the clay that was grete; and thei ronne vpon\nhym and assailed hym full harde, and he hym diffended so\nfiercely that thei hadde no power hym to take; and whan\nGawein saugh his fader on foote, he was full of sorowe, and\nsmote the horse with the spores that the blode ran oute on\nbothe sides, and smote Monaclyn thourgh the shelde and thourgh\nthe hauberke that he fill deed to the erthe, and in the fallinge\nhis spere brake.  Than he drough his swerde that was cleped\nCalibourne, and loked on his fader that hym diffended a-gein\nmo than xl saisnes, and he ran vpon hem with his swerde,\nand smote soche strokes on bothe his sides, that he kutte heedes\nand legges, and armes, and dide soche merveiles that thei fledde from hym and made wey; and Gawein smote a saisne that\npeyned sore to take his fader, that he slyt hym to the breste\nbon, and than hente the horse and ledde it to his fader, and\nthe crye and the noyse a-roos for hym that was deed, and\nther-while is the kynge looth remounted magre alle his enmyes.  Than\ncom the thre brethern of Sir Gawein that hadde made soche\nslaughter of the saisnes, the alle her armours were be-steyne\nwith blode and brayn; and whan thei were to-geder thei\nbe-gonne a stronge medle, and slough so many that it was gret\nmerveile to se, and the saisnes com on euermore, for thei wende\nther hadde be moche peple for the grete slaughter that thei\nhadde made. Whan the kynge looth saugh so moche peple come on\nalle partyes, he cleped his sones, and seide it was\ntyme to go, ffor it were no wisdome to a-bide lenger for to\nresceve xl strokes for the yevinge of oon.  \"But go we hens,\"\nquod he, \"and yef thei vs enchace let vs turne vpon hem\nbe-tymes when we se oure leiseir; with that thei wente theire\nwey and passed the forde delyuerly, and whan thei were ouer\nthei ride forth on her wey; and whan the thre kynges saugh\nhem departe, thei cried vpon her men, \"Now after hem, and\nlete not the traitours ascape.\"  Than thei passed the forde, and\nchaced hem harde, and the kynge Clarion that satte vpon the\nGringalet chaced hem formest the lengthe of an arblast, and\nSir Gawein was be-hynde alle his felowes his swerde in his\nhande all blody; and the sarazin that sore peynes hym to\nouer-take a-scried hym, \"Wy yelde the or thow art but deed;\"\nand Gawein loked and saugh the horse so swyftly renne that\nhe gate grounde sore after hym, and gretly he hym coveited\nin hir herte, and seide yef he myght gete soche an horse, he\nwolde not yeve it for the beste Citee that kynge Arthur hadde,\nand than he gan to ride a softer paas, and rode walopinge, and\nClarion hym enchaced faste after; and whan Gawein saugh\nhe was come so nygh, he turned his shelde and Clarion smote\nso harde hym vpon the shelde that the spere fly on peces;\nand Gawein hym hitte vpon the helme that he slytte thourgh the coyf of mayle and the flessh to the harde boon, that he\nwas so astoned that he fill in swowne to the grounde out of his\nsadill, and Gawein caught Gringalet be the bridell, and ledde\nhym to a grove ther faste by of half a myle, and his fader rode\nalwey forth be-fore and his thre sones, and entended to nought\nelles but to go theire wey, and wende thei hadde alle foure\nbe by hym, and the duste and the powder was so thikke that\noon myght not se fer from hym, and so thei hadde lefte Gawein\nbe-hynde the space of half a myle; and whan Gawein was\ncome in to the grove, he saugh the v gromes come oute of the\nforeste that rode on the v palfreyes, and than was he gladde\nand preised hem moche for that thei hadde peyned hem sore\nhem for to sewe.  Than he a-light of his horse and lepte on\nthe Gringalet, and toke his horse to oon of the gromes for to\nlede, and comaunded hem to go after his fader and his brethern\nthat were gon be-fore, and bidde hem spede hem faste on hir\niourney, and I shall folowe a-noon after, but I will se where\nthese peple will be come.  But he a-bode for nought, for thei\nchaced no ferther, after thei fonde the kynge Clarion lyinge,\nbut stode a-bowte hym, and wende well he hadde ben deed, and\nmade gret doell that sir Gawein myght here the crye ther he\nwas. Thus a-bode Gawein longe in the busshes to loke yef eny\nwolde come after, and the kynge looth and his thre sones\nrode forth till thei come to a litill grove, and as thei sholde\nentre thei loked bak and saugh not Gawein; and at the firste\nworde he seid, \"Ha!

But er he hadde litill wey riden thei\nthat folowe hym ascried hym with high voise, and seide, \"Wy!\nyelde the, and thyn armes, and thyn horse to oure lorde that\na-bideth under the hawthorne;\" and he herde hem well and\nvndirstode, but he ansuerde hem no worde, but rode forth after\nhis squyer and encresed his paas somwhat, and after that he\nrode a walop; and whan the saisnes saugh that he rode so faste,\nthei priked after, and manaced hym sore, and whan he saugh\nhem com he turned his horse hede, and a saisne com be-fore\nalle the other gripinge a grete spere, and hasted hym so faste\nin his comynge that he failed to smyte this yonge lorde, and\nhe com so faste a-gein hym as his horse myght ronne and smote\nthe saisne thourgh shelde and hauberke, and bar hym to grounde\nthat he hadde no myster of no leche, and than he pulled oute\nhis spere, and rode forth his wey a grete paas after lydonas\nhis squyer that wente hym be-fore, for he desired not elles but from the saisnes to passe; and the saisnes priked after faste, for\nin no wyse thei wolde lete hym so ascape, and he rode euener at a grete walop, his spere in his honde, that hadde chaunged his\ncolour fro white in to reade, ffor it was all blody of hym that\nhe hadde slain, and thus he rode forth prayinge our lorde hym\nto diffende from deth a from prison, and the saisnes hym chaced\nwith all the myght of theire horse, so that at laste thei hym\natteyned, and x smote hym on the sholderes and on the sides,\nand he returned and smote so the firste that he mette, that the\nheed and the shafte of his spere shewed thourgh be-hynde,\nthat he fill deed flat to the grounde, and a-nother he smote\nthourgh the throte, and he fill down of his horse in myddell of\nthe wey; and the saisnes com hym a-gein with theire speres, that\nthei made hym to bend ouer his horse croupe, but he fill not\nfrom his sadell, for theire speres fly in peces; and he a-roos and\nwith his spere smote oon of hem thourgh the body, that he fill\ndeed to grounde a-monge his felowes, that were full wroth and\nangry, and ther-with brake his spere, and a-noon he leide honde\nto his swerde that henge at the pomell of his sadell, and drough\nit oute of the scauberke, and the saisnes ronne vpon hym on\nalie partyes, and he smote so the firste that he kute of his\nright sholdre, so that all the side opened that the bowels apered\noute of the wounde, and he fill down deed, and than he smote\na-nother that the heed fill of with all the helme, and than he\nsmote the thridde that he slitte hym to the teth, and the\nremenaunt smyten hym full harde strokes; and whan he saugh\nhe myght not longe endure a-gein so moche peple, but that he\nmoste be take or elles deed, he lefte hem and smote the horse\nwith the spores, and rode faste after lydonas his squyer; and\nthan a-roos the showte and noyse vpon hym right grete, and\nwhan he hadde over-take his squyer, he rode forth hym, and\nseide he wolde not leve his harneys as longe as he myght it\ndiffende; he helde his swerde in his honde all naked, and a\nsaisne com with spere in fewtre, and smote hym a-bove the\nsadell that the hauberke dide folde, and he hadde fallen down\nne hadde he holde hym by his horse nekke; and whan he was vp redressed he loked on hym that hadde hym smyten, and\nhitte hym so sore vpon the heed that he slitte hym to the teth,\nand than thei come rounde a-boute hym on alle parties, and he\nhym diffended as he that was of grete herte, and be-gan to\nsle of hem bothe men and horse, and threwe to grounde all that\nhe dide a-reche.  But all his diffence a-vailed hym but litill\na-gein so many as were a-boute hym, and so it myght not be but\nthat he moste be deed or taken, ffor Pignoras and Monaquyns\nwere come after hym; and than he turned from hem and priked\nhis wey as faste as he myght after his squyer, and Monaquyns\nand Pignoras that saugh noon of her men returne, thei lept to\ntheire horse a com ridinge the wey as the squyer wente and\nsaugh the deed bodyes that were lyinge in the high wey that\nthe squyer hadde slain, and thei asked who hadde this don; and\nthei seide that he hadde don all this that com ridinge by\nhymself, and than thei asked whiche wey he was gon; and thei\nseide, \"Yonder down in a valey, where oure peple fighted with\nhym, but thei may hym not take.\"  Than seide Pignoras, \"Now\nafter hym, and lete hym not thus ascape, for he hath don me\ngrete harme;\" and whan thei herde this thei lete renne after\nthe squyer.  Now god be his gide for his grete pite, for yef\nthei may hym take, he may not ascape in no wise with-outen\ndeth.  But he that in euery nede helpeth hem that in hym\nbyleve, that is oure lorde Ihesu Crist, sente to hym a feire\na-uenture, and ther-fore is seide a proverbe, that god will haue\nsaued, no man may distroye, and here a litill stinteth the tale\nof hym, and returneth to the kynge Looth of Orcanye, and to\nhis foure sones that be in his companye.

Whan the kynge looth and his sones approched that peple,\nthei laced theire helmes and a-light from theire\npalfreyes, and toke theire horses and theire sheldes and com\nthe streight wey to the place ther the bataile hadde I-be, but\nnow thei were with-drawen towarde the Cite; and the Duke\nEscam was be-hynde that diffended his peple merveillously,\nand hadde grete peyne and traueile as he that was in grete\ndoute to lese his Citee; and the kynge looth that was full sory\nand wroth for that he saugh it so go, and sped hym so that\nhe passed the bregge, and com hym a-geins and his foure sones\ntheire hedes bowed down vnder theire helmes, and sore affiched\nin theire stiropes, and com a grete walop as thei that thought\nlonge er thei were medled with the saisnes; and whan the\nDuke hem saugh he a-bode stille, but he knewe hem not, and\nseide a worde that well a-pertened to a man that was in grete\nnede.  \"Ha, lorde god, now helpe and socour thy seruaunt in\nthis grete myschef that we be now ynne, and on that other\nside all that euer thy seruauntes sholde lyven by, these false\nvntrewe saisnes lede a-wey, and all oure richesse that was lefte\nin this contrey;\" than he be-hilde the v knyghtes that he\nsaugh come, but he knewe noon of hem, for theyre sheldes were\nall to-hewen with the strokes that thei hadde resceived, and ne hadde not be that, he hadde knowe the kynge looth anoon;\nand whan he saugh that thei drough nygh, he knewe well that\nthei were not of that contrey, and neuertheles he com a-gein\nhem as he that was well taught, and seide, \"Feire lordes, ye\nbe welcome what wey purpose ye to go, ffor me semeth ye\nbe traueillinge knyghtes.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge looth, \"we\nwolde be at Arestuell in Scotlonde.\"  \"Certes,\" seide the\nDuke, \"ye haue right moche to done, ffor fro hens thider is\nfull felon passage, and yef ye will a-while a-bide in this contrey\nwe shull be gladde and myri, and it is the beste that ye may\ndo, ffor it is but fewe dayes past that the saisnes assembled\nvpon vs.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the kynge looth, \"how moche is it\nfro hens to Arestuell?\"  \"Sir,\" seide the Duke, \"hit is well\nthre grete iourneis.\"  \"What be ye, sir,\" seide the kynge\nlooth, that vs preyen for to a-bide?\"  \"Sir, hit shall not from\nyow be conceiled.

On that other side was the kynge looth, and Gueheret in\nthe medle, and eche of hem hadde smyte down a saisne\nthat deed he moste nede be; and whan the speres were broken\nthei drough swerdes and be-gonne a bataile, so that of v\nknyghtes was neuer sein more fierce bateile; and than the\nDuke sued after, and dide right well hem to rehete, and to\ncontene in that grete nede, and he saugh hem do so moche er\nhe departed fro hem that he wondred that euer mortall man\nmyght so moche suffre of armes.  But whan mydday was\npassed, than dide Gawein alle the merveiles of the worlde, and\nsatte vpon the Gringalet that was so good and feire; and he\nthat satte a-bove was wonder wight and deliuer, and hilde\nCalibourne his swerde, whiche slitte helmes, and sheldes, and\nknyghtes, and horse, and all that he ouertoke, and com thourgh\nthe renges as it were a tempest and slough euere as he com, and\nhe was so chaufed whan it was a-boute the houre of noone that\nnothinge myght agein hym endure, and euery stroke of his\nswerde semed as it hadde be a dynte of thonder, so com it with\ngrete ravyn and grete force; and whan the saisnes it perceived\nthei seide, \"Lo ther a devell that is come oute of helle;\" and\nso yede the tidinges that boydas, and Maundalis, and Oriaunces,\nand Dorilas, these foure hit herden that were maistris of the\nhoste and conditoures. Whan these foure kynges herde the merveile that these\nv knyghtes dide, thei asked whiche wey thei were,\nand thei that hadde hem sein taught hem to the brigge ende vpon\nthe river; with that com the foure kynges thider as Gawein\ndide merveiles the grettest of the worlde, that euer were don\nby oon knyght a-lone; and the Duke escam was com in to her\ncompanye with as moche peple as he myght haue of his foure Ml\nmen that he hadde at the begynnynge, he ne myght not\nassemble, but two thousande and v C , so were thei alle\ndiscounfited; but as soone as the kynge looth and his sones weren\nassembled to them, thei returned agein, and thei that hem\nchaced were mo than x Ml , and ydonas a proude saisne that\nmoche harme hadde hem do of her peple, and neuertheles the\ncristin hem putte oute of the place, and made hem to rusen\nvpon the foure kynges that com hem to socour; and as soone\nas thei were medled with the cristen ther was grete stour and\nright merveilouse; but the myschef was grete, ffor the cristin\nwere not foure Ml , and the sarazins were xviij Ml , and ther-fore\nthei moste remeve whether thei wolde or noon, and were alle\ndiscounfited ne hadde be the vj knyghtes, ffor thei wolde voide\nno grounde, but gate londe vpon hem.  Ther dide Gawein soche\nmerveiles that alle thei hadde wonder that eny man myght soche\nmaistries endure, and Gaheries hym sued all the day, so that\nGawein hym-self hadde merveile that he myght so moche suffre\nand endure, and therfore he loved hym euer all his lif more\nthan alle his other brethern that were so goode knyghtes that\nther were but fewe better in theire tyme. Grete was the bateile and the stour mortall in the plains\nof Cambenyk, at the brigge foote of Saverne of the two\nthousande and v C cristin a-gein viij Ml saisnes, but the cristin ne\nmyght but litill space endure, ne hadde be the well doinge of\nthe v knyghtes of the reame of logres, and so dide well the\nDuke Escam of Cambenyk, ffor he was a noble knyght and\na sure of his body, while thei entended to breke the presse, com\nDodalis, and Moydas, and Oriaunces, and Brandalis vpon swifte\nstedis gripinge grete speres, and mette the Duke Escam a-monge the renges that full wele hadde don all the day, that he ought\nwell to be wery for traueile, and happed that Boydas and\nBraundalis mette hym bothe attonys, and smote hym so on the\nshelde that he reuersed on his horse croupe, and Oriances and\nDodalus smote his horse with theire speres thourgh the flankes\nthat he fill deed be-twene his legges and bare down to grounde\nbothe that oon and the tother, and whan the Duke was fallen\nthei a-bode vpon hym alle foure with swerdes drawen, and\nsoone ther he myght haue ben loste, but as his men com hym\nfor to socoure, and the saisnes com on that other side hym for\nto encombre, and ther was grete slaughter of peple on bothe\nparties; and ther was the Duke foule turmented with horse\nfeet, ffor the saisnes were so many that the Dukes men hadde\nno power hym to remounte.  Ne his enemyes no power hym\nto take, but the saisnes were so many that the cristin myght\nhem not sustene, but most leve place wheder thei wolde or\nnoon; ffor thei haue take the Duke and ledde hym a-wey,\nmagre hem alle betinge hym foule.  Than the kynge loot and\nhis sones com drivinge with swerdes drawen and fonde grete\nplente of peple hym for to lede.  Ther were buffetes I-nowe\nyoven and resceyved, but ne hadde be the weldoinge of Gawein\nthei hadde not endured litill ne moche; ffor he was euer in\nthe former fronte, and hilde Calibourne in his right honde and\nsmote on the right side and on the lifte, and slough so many\nmen and horse, that thei that saugh the merveiles turned to\nflight, and thourgh his prowesse he brake presse magre hem\nalle, and lefte not till he cam to the Duke Escam that the saisnes\nledde.  Ther was than fell stour and mortall, ffor ther was\nAgravain smyten down and Gueheret, and the kynge peyned hym sore\nhem to remounte, and the presse was so grete and the noyse that\nit was merveile; and Gawein and Gaheries ne toke ther-of noon\nheede, but entended to rescue the Duke so that thei haue hym\ngeten be fyn force, and sette hym on horse, and theym that hadde\nhym taken thei haue driven oute of the place magre hem alle. And on that other side whan the kynge saugh his two\nsones vnder the horse feet in a-uenture to lese theire lives, and he hadde no power hem for to socour ne for to\nremounte; than he cried with lowde voice, \"Ffeire sone, what\ndo ye, or where be ye, for here is Agravain at the erthe that\nhath grete nede, and the damage was mortall that vnethe may be\nrestored yef ye tarye lenger;\" and whan Gawein herde the\nvoice he turned his horse a-noon and brake the presse that wey\nwith Calibourne his goode swerde a-gein, whiche noon armure\nmyght endure that he raught a full stroke, and er he hadde\npaste litill wey he mette Gueheret and Agravain in meddill of\nthe presse on foote that full vigerously hem deffended, and the\nkynge looth was euer be hem that sore hym peyned hem to\nhelpe and socoure; and whan Gawein saugh the grete nede he\ncaste to erthe the remenaunt that was lefte of his shelde, and\ncaught Calibourne with bothe handes and spronge in to the\npresse so fiercely that noon durst hym a-bide for the merveiles\nthat thei saugh hym do, and he smote so Mydonas that he\nmette with first, that he slitte hym down to the sholdres, and\nwith a-nother stroke he smote a-wey the lifte arme of Brandalis\nwith all the shelde; and whan the sarazin felte hym-self so\ndiffouled, he fledde cryinge and brayinge as a bole, and Gaheries\nhadde throwe his shilde to grounde and hilde his swerde in bothe\nhandes and smote so Oriaunce vpon the helme that he kutte a\nquarter, and the swerde glent be-twene the body and the shelde,\nand kutte the gige that it hanged on that it fley in to the felde,\nand the stroke descended on the lift thigh so depe that he\nkutte it thourgh, and he fill down to grounde, and Gaheries\ntoke the horse and ledde to Gueheret his brother, and made hym\nskippe in to the sadell, and after he smote a-nother saisne that\nwas well horsed that he made the heed fle in to the felde, and\ncaught the horse and ledde to Agravain his brother, and he lepte\nvp a-noon as he that hadde grete nede; and than thei smote in to\nthe bateile where the kynge was, and sir Gawein that foughten full\nsharply, and Agravain that was full wroth with Dodalus, yaf hym\nsoche a buffet that the heed fill in to the felde a-noon right. And whan the saisnes saugh that alle the high lordes were\ndeed, a-noon thei fledden as thei that hadde theire lordes loste, ne neuer thei stinte till thei com to the baner of ydonas,\nand these hem chaced thider with-oute eny a-bidinge, be-fore\nalle other was sir Gawein and with hym CC of the Dukes men\nthat sore hem peyned hym for to serve, and Elizer euer by and\nbe-fore hym and hilde in hande a cornered axe where-with he\ndelyuered his lorde whan he saugh nede.  In that chace was\nthe Duke throwe down of his horse, for a sarazin smote hym\nso be-hinde that he fill to grounde and was hurt right sore in\nthe fallinge, that stroke saugh full wele the kynge looth that\nchaced on bothe sides, he and his sone Gueheret, and it greved\nhym sore for the Duke, and he spored his horse that wey and\ngriped a grete spere that he hadde take from a saisne, and\nsmote the saisne that hadde smyte down the Duke thourgh the\nsides, and thourgh liver and longes, and than toke the horse and\npresented to the Duke, and anoon he lepte vp and thanked\nhym hertely of that servise that he hadde hym don, and sir\nGawein and Elizer chaced the saisnes and hem sued till thei\ncom to the baner of ydonas.  Ther the saisnes with-stode and\nfoughten a-while, and Gawein that hem pursued drof in\na-monge hem, and smote so on eyther side that all that he\nraught wente to groude; and whan ydonas that aperceived he\nturned that wey, and Gawein hym smote vpon the helme that\nhe slitte hym down right so that men myght se his longes,\nand a-noon as the sarazin was so smyten he fill to the grounde\nand the baner; and whan the Duke saugh the baner reverse\nhe knewe well thei were discounfited, and than he cried his\nsigne with high voyce, and relyed his peple a-boute hym and\nyaf hem assaute delyuerly. Whan the saisnes saugh theire baner falle, and the cristin\ncome on hem so harde, thei durste no more a-bide, but\nturned to flight and lefte the place, and all theire harnoys, and\neche of hem fledde from other thurgh the playnes mate and\ndiscounfited, and ther a-ros soche a duste and soche a shoute\nand noyse that wonder it was to here, but of hem that theym\nchaced was sir Gawein the firste upon the Gringalet, for ther was\nnoon horse that myght renne so faste, and he slough of hem so many in the chace that he and his horse were steyned with\nblode as he hadde fallen in a blody river; and whan thei hadde\nchaced hem to nyght, than returned the kynge, and his sones,\nand alle the other saf Gawein, that thei wiste not where he was\nbe come ne Elizer his squyer, ffor thei had chaced the saisnes\nthat of fin force thei drof hem in to the river of Saverne, and\nther thei drof in so many that the water chaunged colour, and\nwhan thei saugh thei were ouer he returned a-gein a softe paas,\nand the Duke Escam a-bode at the pray, and ledde it home with\nhis men, and sir Gawein past by and spake no worde; and\nwhan the kynge looth saugh him come he made merveilouse\nioye, and asked how he hadde don, and he seide right euell\nwhan eny of hem ascaped and returned as recreaunt whan thei\ndurste not passe the foorde ther thei passed; and the kynge\nseide that was no light thinge to do a man a-lone for to passe. This worde that Gawein seide vndirstode the Duke, and\nseide that he hadde don right wele, ffor he and his\ncompanye hadde brought to an ende that he and his peple ne\nmyght not do, and Gawein rode forth and spake no worde, and\nwell semed by his armes that he hadde not be at soiourne that\nday; and the kynge looth hym asked where he hadde lefte his\nsquyer, and he seide how the saisnes hadde hym all to-hewen,\nand ther-fore be hym to purchase a-nother, and the Duke seide\nhe wolde yeve hym a-nother myghty and stronge, and he seide\n\"gramercye.\"  Than the Duke asked of the kynge looth, and\npraide hym full hertely to tell hym his name, for that he herde\nhym clepe Gawein his sone; and he ansuerde that his name\nwas neuer hidde for no man, ne fro hym sholde it not be kept\npryve, and than he seide, \"Ye ought me well to knowe, for\nmany an euell iourney, and many myry dayes haue we hadde\nto-geder;\" and he seide how he was kynge looth of Orcanye,\nand how these foure were his sones; and whan the Duke this\nvndirstode, he seide that he was welcome, and \"so verily helpe\nme god,\" quod he, \"as I knewe yow not, and blissed be that\ngoode lorde that sente yow hider, ffor this day hadde we all be\ndistroyed ne hadde ye ben, and of this ye seide full trewe that moche wele and moche woo haue we suffred to-geder.

As the storie seith the thre knyghtes of the quenes haue\nso riden thourgh the foreste that thei haue founde a\nfeire launde, and thei a-light and rested hem on the grene herbes,\nand Galashin seide to his felowes, \"Wolde our lorde god that\nsir Gawein and his brethern were now here, and we wolde go\nse the saisnes yef ye wolde assent;\" and than seide Dodinell\nthe sauage that it were a shrewe to go, for in this foreste is\nnoon rescettes, and oure horse sholde dyen for the faute and for\nhungir; and while thei spake of these thinges, com the thre\nfelowes of the rounde table disgised of theire armes, for fayn\nwolde thei haue be pursued of some of the quenes knyghtes;\nand Segramor asked of his felowes yef thei knewe hem ought,\nand thei seide, \"Nay,\" and euer thei come faste on.  Than\nseide Agrauadain to his felowes, \"I se yonder soche thre\nfelowes that me wolde for-thinke that thei sholde lede a-wey\nwith hem theire horse hom a-gein.\"  \"How so,\" quod Mynoras,\n\"be not we thre as well as thei;\" and while thei spake thus, the thre knyghtes laced theire helmes that thei hadde don from\ntheire hedes for to take the air; and thei lepte on theire horse,\nand wolde haue gon theire wey as they thought noon euell,\nseth that noon hem nought asked; and whan these other thre\nsaugh hem goinge, thei hem a-scried with lowde voice, \"Iuste\nyow be-houeth or elles ye shull vs leve youre horse, and so\nmay ye passe quyte;\" and whan Segramor that vndirstode, he\nturned the heed of his horse and seide, \"What be ye than\nrobbours that lyve be soche mysteir, wite it verily whan ye\ncom home to youre hostell to nyght, ye shull have but litill to\nete of the wynnynge that ye shull bringe from vs, for we yow\ndiffie.\"  Than thei smyte the horse with the spores that the\nblode stremed oute on bothe sides, and sette the sheldes be-fore\ntheire brestes and the speres a-gein the assels of theire sadelis;\nand whan Segramor and his felowes saugh hem come in this\nmaner thei dide the same, and com hem for to mete, and fill\nso that Segramore and Agrauadain mette with speres a-gein the\nsheldes so rudely, that thei perced thourgh-oute, and the\nhauberkes brosten agein the lifte side, and Agrauadain felte the\nsharpe spere so depe that the blode folowed after; and\nAgrauadain brake his spere on Segramours hauberke at the same cours,\nand Segramor that hadde herte I-nough and force shof so harde\nthat he threwe hym to grounde and his horse bothe.  But\nAgrauadain that was wight and delyuer, and full of grete\nhardynesse, lepte on his feet full lightly and drough his swerde,\nand appareiled hym self to diffende, and whan Segramor hadde\nparformed his cours he drough a litill a-side and sette foot to\ngrounde, and tacched his horse to his spere, and Agravadayns\nhorse ran faste to the wode, and Segramor drough his suerde\nand dressed his shelde, and com towarde Agravadain a grete\nspede, and he com for to mete hym vigerously, and smyte grete\nstrokes vpon the helmes, and over all ther thei myght atteyne,\nand so endured the medle of hem longe while; and Segramor\nseide, \"Sir knyght, thow art deed, but thow yelde;\" and\nAgrauadain ansuerde \"that to that pointe was he nothinge yet\ncomen;\" and Segramor seide he sholde come ther-to soner than he wende, and that other ansuerde that right litill he hym\ndouted, and seide he cowde well manace; and Segramor seide\nthat verily it was the maner of a fooll, and ther-fore is seide a\nproverbe, that foles love neuer a thinge till he take the a-coole,\nand so is it yow be-fallen.  Than thei ronne to-geder and fought\nlonge, but Agravadain hadde the werse of the bataile. On that othir side mette Galasshin and Mynoras, and fill\nthat Mynoras brake his spere vpon Galashyns shelde,\nand Galashin hym smote with soche vigour vpon the penon of\nthe shelde that he shof the spere thourgh his thigh, and thourgh\nthe horse flanke that thei fill to grounde vpon an heep, and his\nhorse slode also with all foure feet that he also fill to the erthe,\nbut soone was he vpon his feet, and so was Mynoras, and\ndrough theire suerdes, and be-gonne the medle be-twene hem\ntwo full grete and fell with all theire power. And also ran to-geder Dodinell le sauage, and Monevall,\nand mette with speres wher-of the hedes were sharpe\nI-grounden that the sheldes were perced and stinte at the\nhauberkes that were harde, and the speres bothe fly on peces;\nand in the passinge forth Dodinel hurteled so harde with his\nshelde and his body that Monevall fill to grounde, but a-noon\nhe a-roos a-gein, for he was hardy and delyuer; and whan\nDodinell hadde parformed his cours he returned with swerde\ndrawen, and fonde hym redy hym to diffende.  Than he drough\na litill a-side and a-light, and com with his suerde in honde\ngripinge his shelde, and be-gonne to medle and to scirmyssh\nstrongely.  Thus faught these vj knyghtes longe from prime to\nmydday, and the quenes knyghtes be-gonne to gete grounde\nvpon hem of the rounde table, and somwhat ledde hem at hir\nvolunte; and whan thei saugh hem glenche thei hem ascride,\nand seide, \"Yelde yow;\" and thei seide thei hadde lever be\ndeed; and whan thei saugh it wolde noon other be thei ronne\nvpon hem fiercely, and Segramor saugh that his felowe wolde\nnot yelde, and he lepte to hym lightly, and hitte so Agravadain on the helme that he slitte it on two partyes, and the coyf of\nmaile that he wounded sore hym in the heed that he fill to\ngrounde all a-stonyed; but he lay not longe, for he douted sore\na-nother stroke, and covered hym vndir his shelde the beste\nthat he myght, and Dodinell caste a stroke of skirmerye to\nmonevall, and smote hym so harde vpon the arme that he hilde\nwith his shelde, that the shelde fill to grounde that ner he\nhadde hym shente; and Galashin smote so Mynoras on the\nhelme that he bente down to the erthe, and fallen hadde he;\nbut as he kepte hym on his handes, and than Galashin hente\nhym by the helme and raced it of his heed so felliche that nose\nand browes bledde, and yaf hym soche a buffet with his swerde\nthat he fill flatte to grounde, and than he lepte to and a-valed\nthe coyf of maile from his heed and seide he wolde smyte it\nfrom the sholdres, but he wolde hym yelde outerly; and he\nseide he wolde it not do in no wise, and Galashin seide than\nsholde he dye with-oute raunsom. And while thei demened hem in this maner, com kay the\nstiwarde, and sir Ewein, and Gifflet the sone of Doo\nof Cardoell that the kynge hadde sent, but to longe hadde thei\ntaried; ffor Segramor hadde so araied Agrauadain, that he was\nall couered in blode, and dide but glenche here and there fro oo\nplace to a-nother, and Segramor hym chaced for to take hym\na full stroke, and Dodinell hadde his felowe so be-seyn that he\nhadde nother shelde ne helme on his hede, and dide but glenche\nfor to eschewe the deth, and Galashin helde his felowe at the\ngrounde, and with that oon hande hilde hym by the ventaile,\nand his swerde in the tother hande redy to smyten of his heed,\nand in short tyme alle thre sholde haue loste theire lyves; but\nas sir Ewein, and kay, and Gifflet com walopinge as faste as\nthei myght, and cried with lowde voice, \"I-nough it is, for\nwe se well how it is, and we shull hem plegge of what ye will\nhem aske;\" and Segramor turned toward hem and knewe hem\nwele, and ansuerde to sir Ewein, \"Sir, gladly for more wolde I\ndo for yow than this a-mounteth;\" and in the same wise seide\nGalashin and Dodinell, and lefte hem with that, and these com to hem and blamed hem for that thei hadde be-gonne soche\nfolye; and Segramor ansuerde hastely, and seide, \"How so, my\nlorde, sir Ewein haue we vs so mys-taken whan of these thre\nvassals we haue rescewed oure horse, that thei wolde vs haue\nbe-refte.  Nay than hadde we be more shame-worthi yef thei\nhadde hem taken be force, ffor than sholde we neuer haue hadde\nhonour in no place that we hadde comen, and full euell sholde\nhe diffende his felowe that dar not diffende his owne\nthinge.\"  \"Ha,\" quod Ewein, \"thei dide it for noon euell ne for no\nfelonye that thei wolde yow haue don, but pleide with yow;\"\nand Galashin be-gan to laugh vndir his helme, ffor he aparceived\nbe that sir Ewein seide that thei were of the companye of the\nrounde table, and Dodinell seide that \"blissed be soche pley, and\nhem that it be-gynne, for so shull we well lerne.\" \"Lete be these wordes,\" quod sir Ewein, \"and take youre\nhorse, and lete vs repeire hom to the Court, ffor\nther is noon so myghty ne puyssaunt that ne shall haue I-nough\nbataile with-ynne these vj monethes;\" with that these thre\nknyghtes be lepte on theire horse, but the tother thre be trist\nand dolent.

But the saisnes that\nwere maliciouse hadde sette espies on euery side of the town,\nand so was the Quene taken and the stiward slain, whereof was\ngrete harme, and the squyers fledden, and were wounded sore,\nffor that oon was smyten thourgh the body with a spere, and\nthe tother on the heed with a swerde, and so thei wente as\na-uenture hem brought to the hoste that Merlin ledde, and thei\nstinte neuer of goinge till thei herde hem a foure myle from\nGarlot; and whan the squyers saugh the comynge of the hoste\nand parceyved the white baners with the reade crosses, thei\nknewe wele that thei were cristin and dressed hem that wey,\nand made the grettest dolour of the worlde; and whan Merlin,\nthat com all be-fore, herde hem make soche doell, he asked hem\nwhat thei eiled, and thei hym tolde all as was be-fallen, and\nhow the saisnes ledde a-wey the Quene, \"and whiche wey wente\nthei,\" seide Merlin.  \"Sir,\" seide thei, \"she is yet in the\nhoste, but the pray goth by the cauchie;\" and Merlin cried,\n\"Sewe me, ffor the Quene shall thei not lede yef god will.\" Than he spored his horse and sir Gawein after, and Elizer, and\nthe kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors his brother, and ech had in\nhis hande a stronge spere, and leonce of Paierne condited the\npeple of Benoyk; and Dionas theym of Gannes, and Gracien\nhem of Orcanye, and Dorilas condited the peple of kynge Ventre,\nand the other batailes com alle in ordre, and Merlin rode so\ntill that he com downward of an hill, and than they saugh the\npray that passed at the bregge, and ther were well a foure\nthousande saisnes; and whan Gawein saugh hem come, he seide\nnow may we a-bide to longe.  Than he spored the Gringalet,\nand than seide Elizer, \"Sir suffre and a-bide for guerdon of\nmy seruise and for all frendship, and graunte me the firste\nstroke of the bateile, ffor I entred neuer in to no stour seth\nI was knyght.\"  \"And I it yow graunte,\" quod sir Gawein,\nall in laughynge, \"for in yow it is right well employde.\" With that Elizer hem a-scride, and seide, \"Lete be the\npray, ffor ye shall it no ferther lede;\" and than com\nDioglus that was the stiward of the kynge Magloras, and turned\nthe heed of his horse, and he and Elizer mette with speres\nvpon the sheldes so harde that thei perced vpon the bokeles,\nand Dioglus brake his spere, and Elizer hym smote so harde\nthat he shof the spere thourgh the breste, and caste hym down\ndeed to the erthe, and his spere ther-with fly in peces.  Than\nhe drough his swerde and launced in a-monge the other that\nsore hem peyned to passe the pray, and smote so Antidolus\nthat was stiward to the kynge Brandon that he slitte hym down\nto the teth; and Gawein seide to Merlin that he hadde wele\nbe-gonne as of a newe knyght.  \"Ye,\" qoud Merlin, \"yet\nshall he do better.\"  With that Merlin cried the signe of kynge\nArthur, and than spronge forth Gawein and his companye\na-monge the forreyours that many were there slain and wounded;\nand thei be-hoved to forsake place and fledde toward Garlot\nwhere the kynge Magloras was, and the kynge Brandon, and the\nkynge Pynsonars, and the kynge Pignores that right vigerously\nassailed the Castell, and thei were full wroth whan thei saugh\nher men com fleinge, and lefte the assaut and com to theym that fledde; and whan thei saugh the hoste comynge thei merveiled\nfro whens so moche peple myght come.  Neuertheles thei sette\nin a-monge hem for thei were moche peple and stronge, and the\ncristin hem resceyved full fiercely, and made the saisnes for to\nresorte a-gein a spere lengthe; and whan the foure kynges\nthat were hethen saugh sir Gawein and the kynge Ban, and\nthe kynge Bohors, and Elizer make of her men so grete slaughter,\nthei ascride her men, and be-gonne to sle horse, and men, and\nknyghtes as thei were wode, ffor thei were Geauntes, and the\nstrengest peple of the worlde; and thei made the peple of kynge\nBan and kynge Bohors to blush vpon the peple of kynge Ventre,\nand vpon the bateile of the Duke Escam of Cambenyk, and\nther suffred sir Gawein, and the kynge Ban, and his brother,\nand Elizer many sharpe strokes, and full sore were thei greved;\nand whan these two bateiles were come on, ther myght men\nse merveiles don of armes, and sore were the saisnes greved\nat that enuay, ffor many there were of hem leide to the\ngrounde.  But the kynge Brandon and the kynge Pyncenars dide grete\nmerveiles bothe with theire bodyes and theire meyne that were\nfull bolde and hardy; ffor after theire strokes a-bode but fewe\ncristin in sadell, and so were thei of the grete Bretigne sore\na-basshed, ffor thei made hem alle resorte bakke hadde not be\nthe grete prowesse of sir Gawein, and Elizer, and the kynge\nBan and his brother, and the kynge Ventre of Garlot, and the\nDuke Escam of Cambenyk; and neuertheles Grascien, and\nPharien, and Dorilas, and leonce of Paerne dide so wele that\nthei ought to haue no blame; and Merlin that rode fro oo renge\nto a-nother ascride hem often \"ore auaunt;\" and while thei\nwere in this angwyssh the kynge Pignores cleped xl saisnes\nof the beste and moste hardy, and comaunded hem to take\nthe Quene of Garlot, and lede hir to the sege of Clarence,\nand presente hir to the kynge hardogobran, and these seide\nthei sholde do his comaundement, and departed and ride forth\nthe streight wey to Clarence, and ledde with hem the quene\nthat grete doell made for the a-uenture that was hir\nbefallen. After that the kynge Pignoras smote in to the stour with\nhis swerde in honde, and be-gan to yeve soche strokes\nthat noon armure hym myght endure.  So that the moste hardy\ndouted hym to meten, for he smote down horse and men so\nthikke that the moste hardy made hym wey, till that Gawein\nthat to euery nede was nygh it a-parceyved, and saugh the\ngrete harme that he dide of her peple, and seide to hym-self\nyef this feende lyve eny while we may moche lese.  This worde\nvndirstode Elizer that kepte hym euer nygh Gawein and smote\nhis horse with spores thider as he saugh Pignoras that hadde\nall his arme be-soiled with blode and brayne of hem that he\nhadde slayn; and whan Elizer saugh the harme that he dide,\nhe seide to hym-self, \"Certes, it were to vs grete harme yef this\ndeuell lyve longe, what mysauenture hath he be suffred so\nlonge;\" and than he drough ner and leide his reyne in his\nsadilbowe, and threwe his shelde at his bakke and ficched hym\nin his stiropes, and caught his swerde in bothe handes, and\nsmote the kynge Pignores thourgh the helme that nother coyf\nne helme myght hym warant till that the suerdes egge touched\nhys brayn, and he drough a-gein hys suerde and Pignoras fill\ndown to grounde; and whan Merlyn hym saugh falle, he seide\nto sir Gawein, \"This hath take with vs trewys.\"  \"Ye,\"\nquod Gawein, \"god kepe vs that knyght that is so worthi;\"\nand than thei smyte vpon the saisnes that be sorowfull and\nwroth for the deth of Pignores, and so dide theire other felowes\nthat sore thei harmed the saisnes.  But a-bove alle other dide\nsir Gawein wele, and Elizer, and the kynge Ban of Benoyk,\nand the kynge Bohors of Gannes, and leonce of Paierne, and\nGrascien of Trebes, and Pharien, for thei were not yet assembled\nbut v bateiles.  But tho that were assembled dide wonder wele,\nfor a-gein theire strokes myght endure nother Iren ne stiell;\nand whan the kynge Pyncenars, that was bolde and hardy, saugh\nhis peple so a-peire, he seide he hadde leuer dye but Pignores\nwere a-venged, and he hilde a swerde in his right hande, and\nran in to the presse where he saugh it thikkest, and be-gan\nto throwe down all that he raught, and slough a knyght of the reame of Benoyk, that wele hadde don in armes all the day;\nand tho the kynge Ban was nygh wood for Ire, and spronge\nthat wey with his swerde vp teysed to hym that hadde his\nknyght slayn, and smote hym with so grete ire that he slitte\nhym to the teth, and that was a thinge that hym moste\ndiscounforte all the day, the deth of his knyght, and than thei\nclosed the saisnes rounde a-boute, and the bateile was grete and\nhorible, ffor the Bretouns were noble knyghtes; and whan\nMerlin saugh the hostes were assemled on bothe sides, he\ncleped Gawein, and Elizer, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge\nBohors, and tolde hem how xl saisnes ledde the quene of Garlot\nto the sege of Clarence, \"and yef thei lede hir thider it will\nturne to reprof, and therfore I rede we go after.\"  \"Now\nride,\" quod Gawein, \"and we shull yow sue.\"  Than Merlin\nrode forth his weye, and well an hundred knyghtes in his\ncompanye; ffor thei douted to meten with moo peple on som\npart.  But shull we speke of the xl saisnes that ledde the\nQuene of Carlot that was the wif of kynge Ventre. Whan the xl saisnes were past the bateile two myle, thei\nentred in to a wode, where-ynne was a feire medowe\nand a welle springe, and thei turned that wey hem for to a-kele\nand drinke of the clier water, and a-lighten with the quene\nbe-fore the welle, that made the grettest doel of the worlde,\nand thei myght not hir conforte for nothinge that thei cowde\ndo; but she cried with lowde steuen, \"Haa, kynge Ventres,\nthis day shall departe the love of me and of yow; ffor I trowe\nyow neuer to se no more;\" and than she swowned in theire\narmes that hir hilde, and whan she was oute of his swownynge\nshe cried and made grete sorowe, and the saisnes were ther-of\ndoelfull and wolde well she hadde be in place that she hadde\nliked beste, and counforted his moche, but ther-of was no nede;\nffor she braied and cried lowde, so that Gawein and his\ncompanye it herde clierly, and turned thider her wey, and saugh\nthe knyghtes and the Quene that cried so lowede. Whan Gawein saugh his aunte, he spored his horse and\nseide to the saisnes, \"Ffeire lordes, lete be the Quene, and go youre wey quyte, ffor I can yow good thanke for that\nye haue of hir pite, and gramercy for that curtesie.\"  Whan\nMargouns the botiller of kynge Pignores herde sir Gawein thus\nspeke, he asked of his felowes what was her rede, and thei\nseide thei hadde leuer to dye than leve the Quene.  \"And to\nthat ar ye come a-noon,\" quod Gawein.  Than he ran to hem\nwith swerde drawen, and smote so the firste that he mette that\nthe heed fill on the grene be-fore his aunte, and the saisnes\nsterte vp a-noon, and the myschef was grete, for that thei were\non foote, and neuertheles thei slough bothe horse and knyghtes,\nfor thei were of grete prowesse, but ther-of myght not a-vaile,\nfor alle were thei deed, that nought oon ascaped, saf only\nMargons the botiller that hidde hym in a bussh, and sir Gawein\nand his companye com a-gein to the Quene, and counforted hir\nswetly, and she hem asked what thei were.  \"Madame,\" he\nseide, \"I am Gawein, youre nevewe, the sone of kynge looth\nof Orcanye, and this lorde that is here is the kynge Ban of\nBenoyk, and these other kyghtes ben oure felowes.\"  Whan\nthe lady this vndirstode she was gladde, and thanked hem\nhertely of the socour, and than thei sette hir on a palfrey that\nthider was brought, and returned to the hoste where-as was\nthe kynge Arthur and the other princes fightinge; and many\nof her frendes loste the cristin er the saisnes myght be\ndiscounfited.  Whan Arthur hadde slain Magloras the kinge that\nwas the sustenement of the saisnes, and the kynge looth hadde\nsmyte of the hande of the kynge Syuarus, than fledde thei alle;\nand whan sir Gawein and his companye were returned, the\nhoste enchased the saisnes so nygh euer at the spore; and\nBrandons returned often, and he ne smote noon a right stroke,\nbut he were ther-with a-noon deed; and whan sir Gawein saugh\nhym so demene, and saugh the grete slaughter that he made of\nthe peple, he thought wele that he was som high lorde of grete\nlynage, and wele it shewed by his armes that he were a kynge\nor a prince, and Gawein preised hym moche in his herte, and\nfain wolde he hadde be cristin yef it myght haue be, and seide,\n\"Knyght, thow art right bolde and full of grete hardynesse, art thow Duke or kynge that hast in the soche valour and strength?\"\n\"In feith,\" quod he, \"my name is Brandouns, and am kynge\nof a partye of Saxoyne, and am nevew to the richest kynge of\nall the world, that is the kynge hardogabrant, that is chief\nlorde of all Saxonie.\"  \"Certes,\" seide Gawein, \"it semeth\nwell, for in the is grete valour and high prowesse, and it is\ngrete harme that thow art no cristin, and fain I wolde that\nthow so were to respite the fro deth.\"  \"Of that,\" quod the\nkynge, \"that thow spekest haue I merveile, for I haue lever\nto be deed than to be cristin.\"  To that shalt thow come\nhastely,\" quod Gawein, \"and that me repenteth sore, ffor\nmoche wolde I love thy companye yef it the liked.\"  \"Hit\nshall neuer me plese,\" quod Brandouns; and whan Gawein that\nherde, he ran vpon hym full Irousely, and smote hym so with\nCalibourne his good swerde that the heed clef a-sondre; and\nwhan the saisnes saugh theire lorde deed, thei were sore\ndismayed; and after that in hem was litill defence, and the\ncristin hem wounded on euery side, and hem slough, and all\nto-hewe; and whan thei hadde do this, thei thanked moche\noure lorde of the grete honoure that he hath hem do at this\niourney.  Than com sir Gawein and the kynge Ban be-fore\nthe kynge Arthur, and be-fore all the baronye, and presented\nthe kynge Ventre with his wif, and tolde herynge hem alle\nhow he hadde hir rescowed, and the kynge hem thanked hertely,\nand made grete ioye, and alle the barouns were gladde, and\nthan thei drough a litill a-side from the felde where the bataile\nhadde be, and Arthur made picche his teintes in the medow\nbe-fore Garlot vpon the river, and so dide alle the other princes,\nand rested till on the morowe, and the Quene entred in to the\ncastell of Garlot; and on the morowe, as sone as it was day,\nArthur sette forth his peple the streight wey towarde\nClarence.  But now a-while shull we reste of Arthur and his baronye, and\nspeke of Margouns the botiller. So longe dide Margouns hidde hym in the busshes till that\nGawein, and the kynge Ban, and her companye were\ngon with the Quene; and than he repeired to the welle and fonde his horse that he hadde tacched to a tre, and than he\nrode forth faste till he com to the hoste be-fore Clarence, and\ntolde the kynge hardogobran how alle the forreyers that he\nhadde sente be-fore the town of Garlot were deed and\ndiscounfited; and whan Hardogobran this dide vndirstonde he was\nsorowfull and pensif.  Than sterte vpon his feet the kynge\nGondofles, and seide to the kynge Hardogobran, \"Sir, yef it\nlike yow I will go se what it is, and lede with me Salebrun\nand Magaloes, and Sorbare, and Meliadus, and the kynge\nBrangore, and in oure companye xl Ml men, ffor I may not\ntrowe that foure so myghty kynges as the kynge Brandon\nyoure cosin, and the kynge Pyncenars, and the kynge Pignores,\nand the kynge Magloras myght not be brought to disconfiture\nby no power of the cristin;\" and while thei spake these wordes\ncom Syuarus that hadde his hande smyten of, and tolde hem\ntrewe tidinges, and the tokenynge of his arme; whan the kynge\nHardogobran saugh the kynge Syuarus so araied, he was wo\nfor sorowe, ffor he hadde hym moche loved; and whan he\nknewe the deth of the foure kynges than was he wood oute\nof witte, ffor Magloras and Brandouns were bothe his nevewes;\nand than he comaunded to the kynge Gondofles to go take\nvengaunce for his nevewes, and he seide he wolde, and in all\nhaste rode forth his wey, and with hym fifty Ml men, and\ndevided her peple in v bateiles, and in euery bateile x Ml men;\nand the first bataile ledde Salubrun, and the Duke lonor the\nlestregues that other, and the kynge Sorbares, and the kynge\nMeliadus, and the Eirll ffragelles the thirde, and the kynge\nBrangoires, and the Castelein Melekins the fourthe, and the\nkynge Gondofles, and his brother Transmaduc the fifte; these\nrode fro the sege of Clarence oon after a-nother towarde the\nCastell of Garlot, and rode so by day and by nyght till thei\nmette the hoste that Merlin dide gide in a feire grene medow\nthat was a myle and a halfe of lengthe, and ther hadde Merlin\ndevised vij batailes that after hym dide folowe; and the first\nbateile condited the kynge Ventres, and the kynge\nTradilyuaunt, and the Duke Escam with xx Ml men, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and the kynge de Cent Chiualers\nledde the seconde with xxx Ml men; and the kynge of\nNorthumbirlonde, and the kynge of South-walis, and Nabulall the\nthridde with xxx Ml men; and the fourthe ledde Cleodalis the\nSenescall of Carmelide, and the kynge Carados, and the kynge\nlooth of Orcanye with xxx Ml men; and Aguyneron the Senescall\nof kynge Clamedien, and fflamus the Senescall of Evadain, and\nthe Senescall of kynge Pelles of lytenoys ledden the fifte\nbataile with xxx Ml men; and the kynge Brangoires and the Senescall of kynge lak ledden the vj bateile with xxx Ml men;\nand Sir Gawein, and his brethern, and the companye of the\nrounde table were with the kynge Arthur in the vij th bateile\nwher-in were so moche peple that vnethe myght eny man hem\nnombre.  In this maner mette the tweyne hostes of the Cristin,\nand the paynymes in the medowes from Garlot half a walsh\nmyle; and as soone as the kynge Salubruns hem saugh he\nlete renne a-geins hem, and so dide Margons the botiller; and\nthe Duke Escam com hem a-geins; but Triamores that was\nCastelein of Cambenyk rode be-fore, and smote Salubrun so\nharde a-mydde the shelde that the spere splindred on splyntes,\nand the hethen kynge hitte hym so sore that the shafte shof\nthourgh his body and bar hym deed vpright to the erthe; and\nthan was the Duke Escam full angry, and smote Salubrun\nthrough the breste more than a spanne lengthe, and than he\nseide, \"Hethen hounde, thy deth thou hast hent, yet haue I\nnot my frende, and that me mysliked.\" Ther-with assembled the bateiles on bothe two sides, ther\nwas many a grete growen spere frusshed a-sonder, and\nmany a gome to the grounde glode in a stounde; but as soone\nas the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and the kynge de\nCent Chiualers were come with the seconde bateile, and saugh\nthe seconde bateile of the saisnes meve; than thei ronne to-geder\nfiercely, and ther myght a man haue sein many a helme hurled\non an hepe, and many a shafte and shelde frayen to-geder,\nand many hauberke rente of double mayle; grete and hidyouse\nwas the bateile, and the slaughter grete on bothe sides.  Neuertheles whan Merlin saugh the saisnes so vertuouse, he ascride\nthe kynge Ban, \"Sir, what do ye now, ye myght haue hem\nputte oute of the place longe seth, ffor ye be moo peple be\nthat oon half than thei be.\"  Whan the kynge Ban and the\nother princes herde Merlin so crie, thei were half\nshamefast.  Than thei ronne on the saisnes with grete vigour, and made\nhem resorte a-gein magre them alle, and made hem frusshe on\nthe thridde bateile, that the kynge Meliadus, and ffragilles, and\nlanor de betinges dide condite, and these sette hem a-geins;\nther was harde bateile, and merveilouse and grete occision on\nbothe sides that piteouse was to be-holden, and grete traueile\nthei hadden on bothe parties.  And than assembled Brancors\nand Malaquyn the Castelein with the fourthe bateile, and\nGelegnyaunt, and the kynge Cleoles, and ther was crewell\nbateile and fell that in litill while was the felde couered with\ndeed bodyes and wounded peple.  In that metinge was Margouns\nthe botiller deed, and he was sore regreted of the saisnes, and\nwith-oute faile the kynge Ban hym slough with a spere; and\nwhan the kynge Sorbares it saugh he hadde hertely sorowe,\nand he com to the kynge Ban, and wende to smyte hym on\nthe helme, but he kepte the stroke on his shelde, and he smote\nther-on so sore that he slitte it to the bocle, and the stroke\nglood and smote of the horse heed, and the kynge fill to\ngrounde, and his horse be-twene his legges, and the kynge\nSorbares a-bode vpon hym with serde drawen.  But Pharien\ncom hym a-geins that full sory was that his lorde was fallen,\nand smote so harde to the kynge Sorbares vpon the helme\nthat he clef hym to the brayn, and he drough to hym his\nswerde, and he fill down deed; than he caught the horse be\n the reyne, and brought it to the kynge Ban; and whan the\nkynge was vpon horse he smote in to the bateile wroth and\nangry; and the kynge Bohors, and Dionas, and the kynge\nVentres, and the Duke Escam, and alle the other princes dide\nmerveiles of armes, ffor after theire strokes a-bode noon in\nsadill, and the saisnes were so grete and so myghti that thei\ndide hem grete damage of her peple, ffor so many thei slough of the cristin that it was wonder; and so many were deed and\nwounded of cristin and hethen, that the felde was all couered,\nso that oon myght not come to a-nother but ouer deed cors. While this grete occision and this mortall strif dide dure\nwere alle the bateiles assembled on bothe partyes,\nsaf only the bateile of kynge Arthur, and that Merlin ledde a\ntrauerse till thei were come vpon hem be-hynde, and than thei\ngirde in a-monge hem crewelly; and after sir Gawein, and his\nbrethern, and Elizer, and sir Ewein, and Segramor, and the\ncompanye of the rounde table were come to the bateile, ther\nmyght men haue sein a-pertly wonder chyualries shewed of\narmes; and thei slough horse and men, and made sheldes to\nshiver, and hewen helmes from hedes, and kutte handes and\nlegges a-sonder, and dide so wonderfull dedes that vn-ethe myght\neny man be-leve the merveiles ne the grete lardure that thei\nmade of the saisnes; and kay the stiwarde, to whom Merlin\nhadde yove the grete baner to bere of the kynge Arthur, was\neuer in the fore frounte as he that was of grete hardynesse,\nther be-fore alle other dide well sir Gawein, and so dide the\nkynge Arthur, ffor he araught no saisne a full stroke, but he\nwere deed; and full wele dede the princes that were come for\nthe honor of god, these dide so well in that iourney, that thei\nought wele to haue the pardon; and also full wele dide the\nknyghtes of the quene Gonnore, ffor after theire strokes a-bode\nnoon standinge, but straught to grounde all that thei myght\natteyne; and whan the saisnes were thus for-closed, thei were\nsore a-baisshed and turned to discounfiture, and with-oute faile\nthei were waxen so feble that of v kynges, and an erle, and a\nDuke, and of fifty thousande saisnes ne ascaped not foure Ml\nthat all ne were deed or maymed; and with-oute doute it was\nright dere I-bought, ffor thei hadde slayn so many of the\ncristin that it was sore be-wepte as longe as the kynge Arthur\nlyved, ffor many a gentill lady be lefte wedowe, and many a\ngentill mayden dysolat, and with-outen counseile. Whan the kynge Gondofles, and lanor de betinges saugh\nthe grete slaughter of her peple that the cristin hadde slain and alle to-hewen, and sye how thei were for-closed in\nsoche maner that thei myght not returne to theire hoste, and\nthan were thei wroth, ffor thei sye wele thei were but deed,\nbut yef thei toke counseile of hem-self.  Than thei loked a-boute\nand be-helde towarde the see where thei saugh the cristin a\nlitill vn-closed, and that wey thei toke the flight thourgh the\nmedowes, streight toward the see that was ther nygh; and\nwhan the kynge Arthur saugh hem goinge, he cried, \"Now\nafter hem alle attonys;\" and there was many a stroke smyten\nin the chace, ffor the saisnes were grete and stronge, and bolde\nand hardy, and full of grete prowesse, and often thei returned\nvpon hem that hem pursued, and the cristin hem resceyved\nwith good will, and there were many of the saisnes deed and\nsore wounded, and the chace so endured, turnynge often as thei\nwere in flight, till that thei com to the see, where their fonde\nthre of theire Galeyes, that Landalus dide guyde, and a-boode ther\nfor vitaile that sholde come from hem that were gon in forrey\nto the Castell of Garlot; and whan the saisnes saugh the Galeyes\nthei were full gladde, and ronne in who that myght first in the\ngrettest haste.  But thei cowde not hem so hasten but ther\nwas of hem drowned mo than two thousande, and thei that were\nentred kutte a-sonder the ropes and dressed theire sailes, and\nascaped in to the see, and wente ther as the wynde and fortune\nwolde hem drive, that in euell maner hadde theire ioure araied;\nand whan the kynge Arthur and his barouns saugh that thei\nhaue hem so loste, thei returned to the playnes of Garlot to\ntheire tentes, and yolde graces to oure lorde of the victorie that\nthei hadde in this bateile; and for thei were wery for traueile,\nthei hem resten at theire ese of all that thei myghten as thei\nthat hadde grete myster, ffor wery thei were of the traueile of\nthe strokes yevinge and also resceyuinge in the stour, that\nhadde be right grete, and than ete and dranke, and than loked\nthe wounded and hurt peple, and hadde hem to the castell of\nGarlot, and were of hem xxxv knyghtes, and v were wounded\nof the companye of the rounde table, wherfore the kynge Arthur\nwas full pensif and sory, and that oon was hervy de rivell, and males le bruns, and the thridde was Clamedos, and the fourthe\nwas Arestobolus, and the v e landouns of Carmelide; and the\nkynge Arthur praied the leche to take of hem good hede, and\nthei badde he sholde not be dismayed, ffor in short terme thei\nsholde be hool, and sounde with helpe of god; and ther-fore was\nthe kynge gladde and alle the Barouns, and ther thei soiourned\nthat nyght till it was day, that Merlin bad hem trusse tentes\nand Pavilouns, and that thei sholde come after hym redy armed\nher enmyes to assaile, and a-non it was don as he comaunded;\nand than thei ride forth toward Clarence, and whan thei were\nso nygh, that thei myght se tentes and Pavelouns, Merlin\nhem shewed to the kynge Arthur, and seide, \"Sir, lo yonder\ntheym by whos comaundement the londe is distroied of yow\nand youre barouns.

Ne these peple shull neuer be disseuered ne departed er ye haue pees\nwith the kynge Arthur, and that heue ye me graunted.\" Whan the barouns this vndirstoden ther were some that\nit liked nothinge, but other-wise myght it not be,\nand so thei graunted alle to the volunte of Merlin, and dide\nhomage to the kynge Arthur oon after a-nother, and of hym\nresceived theire londes and theire fees all tho that ought it for\nto do; and than the ioye was grete thourgh all the hoste; and\nthan thei devised theire bateiles, and wente a-gein the saisnes\nthat weren at the sege be-fore Clarence that it dide assaile from\nday to day, but it was so stronge that thei myght but litill\nwynne, ffor it was well garnysshed of good peple and vitaile,\nffor alle tho that eny armes myght bere of x myle a-boute were\nwith-ynne the town bothe knyght, and burgeise, and oon and\nother, wher-of ther was lv. Ml that many of hem were full bolde\nand hardy, and defensable, and diffended the town a-gein the\nsaisnes full vigerously, and launched at hem many a quarell,\nand many a sharpe spere and dart wher-with many a saisne was\nslain and sore wounded, that neuer after ne dide ride ne go;\nand grete and hidouse was the assaut the same hour that the\ncristin com vpon; and Merlin and his companye com with the\ngrete baner in his hande, and whan he com nygh the saisnes\nhe sente his peple in four partyes of the hoste of saisnes, and\nsmyten thourgh the tentes and thourgh the pavelons, and kutte\na-sonder ropes and cordes, and threwe down all that stode\nvpright, and the saisnes that of this comynge toke no rewarde,\nherde the noyse, and the bruyte, and the lowde cries, and\nsaugh theire pavelouns ouerthrowen on euery side, thei were\ngretly affraied and lefte the assaute, and turned that wey who\nthat myght sonest, eche hastyer than other; and than ther was\nsoche noyse and shoute whan eche man cried his ensigne that\noon myght here it a myle of lengthe; and than be-gan the\nbateile fierce and merveilouse, and smyte sore with speres and\nswerdes that oon vpon the tother, and grete was the slaughter\non bothe sides.  But for oon that was deed of the cristin was\nfoure deed of the saisnes, neuertheles thei were moo peple, and of gretter strengthe than were cristin.  But the cristin were\nwonder light and delyuer, and full of high prowesse to furnyssh\na bateile, and at the firste brunt was many a cristin leide to\ngrounde, and many a saisne deed, wherfore the kynge\nhardogobran was full wroth and angry, and he griped in his hande a\ngrete plante of an oke ther-on an heed of steill sharp I-grounde,\nand com rynnynge with grete randon a-gein the kynge Cleoles\nthat for the love of oure lorde was come to that iourney with\nvij Ml men that full well dide in that stoure; and whan Cleoles\nsaugh hym come, he deigned not to fle as he that was of grete\nhardynesse, but turned the heed of his horse with his spere in\nfewtre, and mette so with grete raundon and force that the\nsheldes perced and hauberkes dismayled, but the flessh thei not\ntouched, but thei hurteled so to-geder with theire helmes and\nsheldes, for the horse com with grete ravyn, and mette breste\na-gein breste that bothe fill to grounde, horse and the men, ffor\nthe speres were spent, and thei lefte lyinge on the grounde sore\na-stonyed that thei myght not meve, ffor the horse lay vpon\nhem as thei hadde be deed, and the two kynges were bothe in\nswowne theym vnder; and grete was the bateile to rescowe the\ntwo princes, ffor alle the bateilles of the saisnes ronne that\nwey, and also dide the cristin.  Ther was many a hevy stroke\nyoven and resceyved, and the saisnes remountede the kynge\nhardogobran; but first was deed moo than two thousande what\noon and other, and on that other side the cristin remounted\nCleoles, but thei fonde his lifte arme broken in the falle that\nhe hadde, and ther-fore were his men sory and wrorth, and\na-noon lete bere hym to the harneys; and whan thei hadde\nleyde hym on a cowche, he preide his men for goddes love to\ngo to the bateile, and thei so dide full Irouse, and in talent to\navenge theire lorde, and thei slough at that enuaye two kynges\nof the saisnes wher-of that oon was cleped Brangore, and the\ntother Margounces.  This Margounces was cosin germayn to\nAungis the saisne, and than thei be-gonne to do so well in\narmes that moche were thei preised and comended, and be-holde\nfor grete merveile of the saisnes and of the cristin; and also on that other side faught the kynge Ban, and the kynge\nBohors, and the kynge Ventres, and the kynge Vrien; and on\na-nother side of the bateile faught the kynge Tradilyuaunt of\nnorth walys, and the kynge de Cent Chiualers, and the kynge\nClarion of Northumbirlonde, and the Duke Escam of Cambenyk;\nand on that other side of the hoste faught the kynge Belynans,\nand the kynge of Strangore, and the kynge of Scotlonde, and\nthe kynge of Cornewaile, and Mynoras the senescall of the\nkynge lak, and of the kynge Euadain that were brethern to the\nkynge Clamedien, and Galegnynans the Senescall of Galehaut,\nthe sone of the Geaunt, and the Duke Belyas of loseres, and\nMargondes, the senescall of Sorloys, that alle were come for the\nlove of oure lorde; and on that other side Gosenges, the sone\nof kynge Amant, and Nabunall his Senescall, and Cleodalis the\nSenescall of kynge leodogan of Carmelide; and on a-nother part\nof the hoste was the kynge Arthur, and the kynge looth, and\nsir Gawein, and his brethern, and sir Ewein, and Segramor,\nand kay the stiwarde that bar the baner, and the bateile was\nso well be-gonne on euery parte that it was merveile; and\nMerlin wente from o bateile to a-nother, and satte vpon a\ncourser, and cried lowde, \"Now lete se now gentill knyghtes,\nnow is come the day and the houre that youre prowesse shall\nbe shewed;\" and whan the kynge and the princes herde\nMerlin crie, thei constreyned hem-self to shewe the grettest\nforce that thei hadden; and whan thei of the town saugh the\nbateile so mortall and so dolerouse, and thei saugh the cristin\nand the saisnes throwen to grounde so thikke, that oon fill on\na-nother.  And thei saugh the signes of the reade crosse in the\nwhite baners, and thei thought wele it was socour that god\nhadde hem sent, and made the yates to be opened and issed\noute of the town alle armed and smote in to the bateile full\nvigerously, and be-gonne to do full well in armes, and so dide\nalle the other.  But a-monge the saisnes thei fonde grete\ndiffence.

Whan the lorde of the Castell herde hym blowe so harde,\nand that he was so hasty, he hilde ther-of grete\ndispite, and for anger lepte on a grete stede in haste with shelde\na-boute his nekke, and his spere in honde, and a-noon the yate\nwas open; and he rode oute a grete raundon, and com to the\nfoorde, and whan he saugh the peple on the tother side, he\ncried and asked what peple thei were; and the kynge Ban\nansuerde, \"Sir, we be knyghtes, that requere herberowe this\nnyght yef it plese yow, and feriage for oure horse at this\nfoorde.\"  \"With whom be ye,\" guod Agrauadain.  \"Sir,\"\nquod Merlin, that was nigh; \"we be of this other contrey of\nthe partyes of Gaule.\"  \"And of what parties of Gaule,\" quod\nAgrauadain.  \"Sir,\" seide Merlin, \"thei holde theire londes\nof god and of kynge Arthur.\"  \"In godis name,\" seide\nAgrauadain, \"thei haue a gode lorde, ffor of the kynge Arthur may\nthei not empeire, for he is a noble kynge, and a good knyght,\nand he is my lorde, and for his love shull ye haue hostell\nat youre volunte.\"  \"Gramercy, sir,\" seide the kynge; than\na-noon right Agrauadain hym turned, and badde the knyghtes\nhym sewe, and seide thei were alle welcome; and thei wente\na-noon after hym oon after a-nother ouer the bregge to the\ngates of the castell, and entred in after that the lorde of the\nplace was entred, ffor ther was no space to turne on his horse\ner he were entred and paste the yate; and than the lorde\nhym-self condited hem in to the castell, and a-noon lepen oute squyres and yomen to make hem a-light, and the lorde toke the two\nknyghtes be the hande, for that hym semed thei were princes\nand lordes of the othere, and ledde hem in to a chambir of the\ntour hem to vn-arme, and hym-self dide helpe for to vn-arme,\nand ther-while entred in thre maydenes of right grete bewte,\nwher-of tweyne were neces vn-to agrauadain; and the thridde\nwas his doughter, and thei brought thre mantels furred with\nermyn, and the cloth was scarlet, and thei caste hem vpon the\ntwo kynges; and the thridde vpon Agrauadain, and the kynge\nBan that was a lusty knyght be-hilde the maydenys, and liked\nwell theire companye, and countenaunce that were right feire\nand of grete bewte, that it was wonder to be-holde, and alle\nthre were of feire age, ffor the eldest was but xiiij yere, but\na-bove alle the other was the lordes doughter the feirest; and\nMerlin be-hilde hir with grete anguyssh, and thought in his\nherte that well were he that with soche a creature myght ly,\n\"and ne were the grete love that I haue,\" quod he \"to\nNimyane, my love, I sholde haue hir this nyght in myn armes, and\nseth I may not hir haue, I shall lete hir be knowe with the\nkynge Ban;\" and than he made a coniorison softly, and a-noon\nas he hadde it made the kynge Ban loved the mayden, and\nshe hym also right sore. Whan these two knyghtes were araide with these two\nmantels that the maydenys hadde brought, than\nAgrauadain, the lorde of the castell, sette hym down by hem, and\nloked on these two kynges, and knewe hem a-noon; and than\nhe made hem gretter chere than he hadde do be-forn, and dide\nhem more reverence; and whan it was tyme to go to soper,\nthe clothes were spradde vpon the tables thourgh the paleys\nthat was grete and large, and the two kynges that were\nbrethren satte down at the high table, and made agrauadain\nsitte down by hem and his wif that was a feire yonge lady of\nxviij yere of age, and the knyghtes were sette at other tables\nthourgh the halle, and the thre maydenys that were so feire\nand auenaunt were stondinge be-fore the two kynges, and be-fore\nAgrauadain; and Merlin that was with hem transformed in to the semblaunce of a yonge knyght of xv yere age, and was\nclothed in a short garnement party read and white, and was\ngirt with a bawdrike of silke of brede of a spanne wele and\nrichely harnysshed with golde and stones, and ther-on hinge\na gipser or purpill samyte bete with golde, and hadde a peire\nof gloues hanginge hym be-hynde, and his heed was yelow\nand curle, and his iyen grey and grete in his heed, and kerved\nbe-fore the kynge Ban knelinge, and he was moche be-holden\nof oon and other, ffor ther was noon that hym knewe saf the\ntwo kynges, ffor tho that were her meyne wende he hadde be\nwith the lorde of the place, and for his grete bewte the\nmaydenys be-hilde hym often ententifly.  But the doughter of\nAgrauadain hadde sette hir iyen moste vpon the kynge Ban\nmore than on eny othir thinge, for the coniurison that Merlin\nhadde made, and putte hir to grete affray; and she liked hym\nso well that it made hir to chaunge colour ofte sithes, and longe\nher thought er the clothes were taken vp, ffor fain wolde she\nhaue leyn be-twene his armes, and she cowde not wite how\nthat volunte to hir com.  But so moche she hath ther-on sette\nher thought, that to noon othir thinge she toke no tent but to\nthenke of hym. In this thought and this anguyssh was the mayden by the\nconiurison of Merlin; and on that other side was the\nkynge Ban so a-raied that he left pley and laughinge at the\ntable, and cowde not wite how it was to hym come, and he\nwas sory and wroth of that he hadde his love so turned, ffor he\nhadde to wif a yonge lady of grete bewte, to whom he ne\nwolden not false his feith; and on that other side he thought\nhow he was herberowed ther-ynne, and the lorde of the place\nwas a noble man and a curteyse, and hadde hym don grete\nhonoure, and hym semed it were vntrouthe and treson, and to\ngrete vilonye sholde it to hym turne yef he required hir of\nshame or dishoneste.  Ne no gretter shame myght he hym do\nthan diffoule his doughter in soche maner; and ther-with he\nwax so euell at ese that he wiste not what to do, and alwey he\nseide in his corage that he wolde neuer hir requyre of no soche thinge.  But Merlin thought wele in his herte that so sholde\nit not go, ffor he thought it hadde be grete harme yef thei\nhadde not come to-geder, ffor soche fruyte sholde come be-twene\nhem wher-of all the londe of Breteigne sholde be honoured by\nthe grete prowesse that he sholde haue. All thus seide Merlin to hym-self; and whan the clothes\nwere drawen, and thei hadde waisshe theire handes\nthei yede to the wyndowes, and be-helde the marasse; and on\nthat othir side thei saugh the foreste and the forteresses that\nwere ther a-boute, and the erable londe and the feire fisshinge,\nand saugh the vynes and the contrey so feire that merveile it\nwas to be-holden; and ther thei stode till it was tyme to go\nto bedde, and entred in to a chambre by the halle where the\nmaydenys hadde made redy two beddes soche as apertend to\ntwo soche princes, and thei were brought to bedde with grete\nioye and feste; and whan the two kynges were brought to\nbedde, the lorde of the place wente to bedde with his wif, and\nthe thre maydenys lay in a-nother chamber next by the chamber\nof Agrauadain, so that noon myght entre but thourgh his\nchamber; and a-noon as thei were a-bedde, Merlin be-gan an\nenchauntement, and made hem to slepe alle that were\nwith-ynne the Castell saf only the kynge Ban and the\nmayden.  These tweyne were so surprised that oon vpon that other, that\nthei myght nother slepe ne reste, and Merlin, that wolde acheive\nthat he hadde be-gonne, com in to the chamber ther the mayden\nlay, and toke hir softly by the hande and seide, \"Now, feire\nlady, a-rise, and come to hym that so moche yow desireth;\" and\nshe that so sore was enchaunted myght not with-sey his volunte,\nbut a-noon a-roos vp oute of hir bedde naked saf, she first dide\non hir smok, and Merlin her ledde by her fader beddes side,\nand by the beddes of other knyghtes ther-ynne; but thei were\nso stronge a-slepe, that thei myght not a-wake.  Thus wente\nMerlin and the mayden till thei com in to the chamber ther\nthe two kynges lay, wher-ynne was light I-nough, and fond the\nkynge Bohors sore a-slepe, as he that was in the power of\nMerlin, and thei com streight to the kynge Ban that was at moche mysese, and seide, \"Sir, lo here the gode and the feire\nwhiche shall bringe forth the feire and the good, of whom the\ngrete renomede shall renne thourgh all Breteigne.\" Whan the kynge saugh the mayden, and he hadde\nvndirstonde Merlin, a-noon he spradde his armes, and hir\nresceived gladde and myry, as he that moste do the\ncomaundement of Merlin, and he hadde no power it to with-stonde, for\nthe enchauntement wher-with he was so surprised that he\nmyght it not forsake in no maner; ffor yef it were in poste he\nwolde it not haue do for all the reme of grete Breteigne, for\nsore he dredde oure lorde; and satte vp and resceyved the\nmayden in his armes, and she dide of hir smok, and leide hir\ndown by hym, and her toke in his armes and she dide hym,\nand eche of hem made feire chere and right good semblaunt, as\nthei hadde be to-geder xx yere, for noon of hem was a-shamed\nne dismayed of other, and all this hadde Merlin it\nordeyned.  In this manere was the kynge and the damesell till day, and\nthan com Merlin to the kynge Ban, and seide that it were tyme\nthat the damesell yede a-gein, and she dide on hir smok and\nhir kirtill; and the kynge toke a ringe of his fynger, and side,\n\"Swete love, kepe this ringe for my love;\" and the damesell\nit toke and sette it on hir finger, and so thei departed; and\nMerlin brought hir a-gein in to hir bedde, and made hir to ly\ndown all naked that hadde conceyved a sone, of whom launcelot\nafter hadde grete ioye and honour for the bounte and Chiualrie\nthat was in hym.  Whan Merlin hadde brought the damesell in\nhir bedde, he wente to his owne bedde and lay down, and than\nbrake the enchauntement, and alle that were in the castell\na-woke, and it was than feire day; and than a-rise knyghtes and\nsquyres, and alle seruauntes, and made redy theire armures,\nand sadeled theire horse, and trussed coufres and males, and\nMerlin com to the kynge that was a-slepe, ffor the\nenchauntement of the love of the damesell was cessed, and he wiste well\nthat he hadde by hir leyen, but he knewe not in what maner\nne how he hadde hir in his bedde, saf he supposed it was by\nMerlin; and Merlin com to hym, and seide it was sone tyme to ride; and whan the two kinges were vp, and alle tho that\nwere ther-ynne; than com the lorde and the thre damesselles to\nthe two kynges and salued, and thei hem grete a-gein godely;\nand whan the kynge Ban saugh the doughter of Agrauadain\nthat al nyght hadde leyn with hym he be-heilde hir full\nententifly, and she hym full swetly bowinge down with the\nheed as she that was shamefaste, that she hadde be so prevy\nwith hym, and that she hadde be so-bolde; and but yef the\nforce and the enchauntement hadde not cessed, she ne hadde\nther-of be nothinge a-baisshed for hym, and ther was neuer\nhour after but she hym loved more than eny other man, and\nthat shewed well, for neuer after that wolde she neuer haue\na-do with no man, but seide to hir-self that a woman that\nhadde ben so with a kynge ne ought neuer be so famyler with\nnoon other man of lower degre.  Ne neuer after wolde she be\nmaried; and the kynge Ban toke hir be the hande, and seide,\n\"Damesell, I moste nede departe at this tyme, but\nwher-so-euer I be I am youre knyght as trewly as eny man may be,\nand I praye yow haue in mynde to kepe youre body, ffor ye\nbe conceyved with a sone, and that I do yow verily to wite of\nwhom ye shull haue ioye and honour;\" and of this Merlin\nhadde do hym to vndirstonde that knewe a partye of thinges\nthat were to come; and the damesell ansuerde in baas voyce\nsore syghinge, and seide, \"Sir, yef it so be god to his pleiser\nsende me more ioye ther-of than I haue of youre departinge,\nffor neuer here be-forn was love so soone departed, and seth\nyow be-hove nede for to go, I shall conforte my-self the beste\nwise I may with this that I am with conceyved; now god sende\nme grace that I be a gladde moder, ffor yef I lyve so longe that\nI may it se, hit shall be to me a myrour and confort in\nremembraunce of yow;\" with that worde the kynge toke hir in his\narmes, and with sighinge comaunded hir to god; and the\ndamesell returned to hir chamber with the maydenes and\nthe two kynges; and Merlin comaunded the lady to god, and\nthanked hir for the grete curtesie and chere that thei hadde\nfounden; and after thei toke theire horse and departed oute of the Castell, and rode forth the cauchie oon after a-nother, and\nAgrauadain hem conveyed to the pyne tre, and than returned;\nand the two kynges rode forth to the see, and founden shippes,\nand passed ouer; and whan thei were landed thei ride forth\ntill thei come to Benoyk, where thei were resceived with grete\nioye; but a-bove alle other were the two sustres, the Quenes\ngladde and ioyfull, and so the two kynges soiourned viij dayes\nin Benoyk with theire two wifes, and with hem also Merlin;\nand the ix the day he toke leve of the two kynges and the\nQuenes, and of the other barouns, and repeired to Nimiane, his\nowne love, that made hym grete chire, and of hym was gladde\nand ioyfull, ffor moche she hym loved for the grete debonerte\nthat she hadde in hym founden, and he loved nothinge so wele\nas he dide hir, and wele it shewed, ffor he taught hir that he\nwolde not teche to noon other, and so he a-bode with hir viij\ndayes, and than departed and com to Blase, his maister, that\nso moche desired hym to se; and Merlin hym tolde the assemble\non the playn of Salisbery, and how thei rescewed the Quene of\nGarlot, and the pray, and tolde hym alle thinges that were\nbe-fallen seth he fro hym departed, and he hem wrote in his\nboke.

Whan the kynge and the barouns hadde herde euesonge\nat the mynster of seint Stephene, the tables were sette in teintes\nand Pavelons, ffor thei myght not alle in to the town; and\non that othir side was the Quene Gonnore, and the ladyes and\ndamesels with soche ioye that merveile it were to reherse, ffor\nin all the londe of Breteigne, ne in all the power of kynge\nArthur, ne lefte mynstrall ne iogeloure ne oon ne other, but alle\nwere come to that feeste; and at that soper were thei served\nso well as was convenient to so myghty a prince as was the\nkynge Arthure, and thus endured thei in ioye and myrthe till\ntyme was to go to reste till on the morowe.  And on the morowe\na-roos the kynge Arthure, and the riche barouns, and the Quene,\nand wente to hire masse at the mynster of Seint Stephene, and\nthe servise was honorably seide in the worship and reuerence\nof that high feste, and grete and riche was the offrande; and\nthe kynge Arthur and alle other kynges and Quenes that day\nbar crownes in worship of the day, and so ther were lx crownes,\nwhat of kynges and quenes; and whan the masse was seide, and\nthe seruise ended the kynge Arthur lepe on his palfrey, and\nalle the other kynges after hym I-crowned, and so dide the\nquene Gonnore and alle the other quenes, and eueryche of hem\na crowne of golde on theire heedes; and the kinge Arthur satte\nat the high deyse, and made alle the xij kynges sitte at his\ntable downwarde a renge; and also in honour of the high feste\nof oure lady, he made the Quene Gonnore sitte by hym\ncrowned, and so dide alle the other xij quenes by-fore theire\nlordes; and at other tables satte other princes, Dukes, and\nErles, and othir knyghtes were sette richely thourgh the\nmedowes in tentes and Pavelouns with grete ioy and melodye\nthat neuer was seyn gretter in no Court. And as thei were in this ioye, and in this feste, and kay\nthe stiward that brought the firste mese be-fore the kynge, ther com in the feirest forme of man that euer hadde\nthei seyn be-fore, and he was clothed in samyte, and girte with\na bawdrike of silke harnysshed with golde and preciouse stones,\nthat all the paleys flamed of the light, and the heir of his\nhede was yelowe and crispe with a crowne of golde ther-on as\nhe hadde ben a kynge, and his hosen of fin scarlet, and his\nshone of white cordewan orfraied, and bokeled with fin golde;\nand hadde an harpe a-bowte his nekke of siluer richely wrought,\nand the stringes were-of fin golde wire, and the harpe was\nsette with preciouse stones; and the man that it bar was so\nfeire of body and of visage that neuer hadde thei sein noon\nso feire a creature; but this a-peired moche his bewte and his\nvisage for that he was blinde, and yet were the iyen in his\nheed feire and clier; and he hadde a litill cheyne of siluer\ntacched to his arme, and to that cheyne a litill spayne was\nbounde as white as snowe, and a litill coler a-boute his nekke\nof silke harneysed with golde; and this spaynell ledde hym\nstreight be-fore the kynge Arthur, and he harped a lay of\nBreteigne full swetely that wonder was to here, and the refraite\nof his laye salewed the kynge Arthur, and the Quene Gonnore,\nand alle the other after; and kay the stiward that brought\nthe firste cours taried a-while in the settinge down to be-holde\nthe harpur ententifly.  But now we moste cesse of hem a-while,\nand speke of the kynge Rion. In this partie the storie seith that whan the kynge Ryon\nwas discounfited of the kynge Arthur, and of the kynge\nleodogan of Carmelide, he departed from that stour sory and\nwroth, as he that all hadde loste in that bateile, and repeired hom in to his contrey triste and sorowfull, and swor his oth\nthat neuer sholde he haue ioye ne reste till he hadde distroied\nthe kynge leodogan, and chaced hym oute of his londe, and\nsente writtes and letteres to alle the lordes and knyghtes of his\nreame in lengthe and in brede, and to alle the reames that he\nhadde conquered, and that were ix by a count, and assembled\nso moche peple that it was merveile to se; the first kynge\nthat com at the comaundement of kynge Rion was the kynge Palerens, and hadde in his companye xv Ml men that were bolde\nand hardy; after com the kynge Tasurs with xij Ml men; and\nthe kynge Brinans brought xiiij Ml men wele horsed and a-raied\nfor to helpe theire lorde, and the kynge Argans brought xi Ml men; and the kynge Taurus brought xi Ml men whiche hadde\ngrete corage to a-venge the shame of kynge Rion; after that\ncom the kynge Arade de galoire with xv Ml men in his\ncompanye; and the kynge Solimas brought xx Ml men wele horsed;\nand the kynge Kahadins brought x Ml ; and the kynge Alipantius\nof the londe des pastures brought xx MI men; whan thei were\ncome and assembled at the comaundement of the kynge Rion,\nand he hem saugh alle be-fore hym he made his complaynt\nand his clamoure heringe hem alle, and seide to hem full\nsympilly, \"Lordinges, ye be alle my liege men, and of me\nye holde youre londes and youre fees, and ther-fore ye owe\nto bere me feith a-gein alle men; and for I knowe youre hertes\nfin and trewe, and that ye wolde in nothinge a-gein me not\nerre, and therfore I yow pray and require that ye me helpe to\na-venge my shame, nought only myn but alle youres; ffor he\nthat doth to me shame or vylonye, he doth it not only to me,\nbut to yow alle in generall, and therfore I pray yow and require\nbe the oth that ye haue made to me that ye be with-ynne this\ntwo monethes be-fore Torayse a-gein the kynge leodogan of\nCarmelide that by his force hath me discounfited and chaced\noute of the feilde, and therfore I require yow that ther on be\ntake vengaunce;\" and thei ansuerde alle with oo voice, and\nseide, \"Of that it nedeth vs neuer to preyen, for this shall be\ndon at youre plesier.\"  With that thei departed and wente\nhom in to theire contrey, and made hem redy, and com at the\nday that was named with grete force be-fore the castell of\nTorayse; and the kynge Rion com with all his peple, and\nbe-seged town all a-boute, and gadered the prayes in her\ncomynge.  But Cleodalis the stiward of Carmelide that was a\nnoble knyght, and a trewe to his lorde chalenged it full fiercely\nof the forreyours, ffor he com out with xx Ml men that he hadde\nwith-holden to kepe the marches, and faught with hem fiercely, and rescowed the pray, and brought it in to the Castell and\nmade shette the yates; and the kynge Rion and his peple logged\na-boute the castell, and sette vp teintes and Pavelons, and\nrested the firste nyght, and on the morowe thei assailed the\ntown and the castell; and the kynge leodogan and Cleodales\ncam oute by a posterne that opened a-gein the river, euen\nright a-geins the teinte of kynge Solymas that was gon to the\nassaute of a yate, and the kynge leodogan drofe thourgh the\nteintes and Pavelouns, and with hym Cleodales, and caste\ndown to the erthe all that vp-right dide stonde, and toke golde\nand siluer, and vesselles of golde and other Iuwelles, and\nbrought in to the town, and in to the Castell by\nstrengthe.  Than were thei of the hoste full sory and wroth; and the kynge\nRion seide all that sholde nought hem a-vaile, ffor he wolde\nneuer departe from the castell till he hadde it taken, and the\nkinge leodogan putte in his mercy; and than thei with-drough\nhem from the assaute, and so a-bide fyve dayes with-outen\nshotte or other dedes, and while that the kynge Rion lay thus\nat soiour, hit was tolde how the kynge Arthur hadde\ndiscounfited the saisnes, and chaced hem oute of the londe, and that\nat the assumpcion he sholde holde court roiall in the towon of\nCameloth; and whan the kynge Rion herde thus, he seide,\n\"Now lete hym feesten, ffor as soone as I haue the kynge\nleodogan in my bailly, I shall go vpon hym with so moche\npeple that he shall it not endure; and neuertheles yef the\nkynge Arthur come to me to aske mercy er I come vpon hym\nwith myn hoste I will haue of hym pite, and suffre hym to\nregne, and of me holde his londe.\"  \"Sir,\" seide his men,\n\"sende hym a message, and do hym to wite that it were better\nto hym to be-come youre man than to be distroied and his\nlonde waste.\"  \"So will I do,\" quod the kynge Rion;\" and\nthan he lete write a letter, and it dide ensele with his seell,\nand than he cleped to hym a knyght in whom he moche trusted,\nand made hym for to swere that he sholde take this letter to\nkynge Arthur in his owne hande, and he swor that in the\nsame maner it sholde be do; and than the kynge Rion delyuered hym this lettere, and a-noon he departed and rode forth the\nnexte wey toward Camelot, and with hym but a squyer; and\nthe kynge Rion a-bode stille be-fore Torayse, and comaunded\nhis peple to armen hem, and to assaile the castell, ffor he hadde\ngrete dispite that soche a place with so fewe peple sholde a-geins\nhym holde day or houre, ffor hym semed he hadde mo knyghtes\nin his hoste than ther were men, and women, and childeren in\nthe town, \"and therefore it is grete shame to ley the sege, ffor\nwe myght haue taken it at oure first comynge by force, and\ntherfore shull we be the lesse preised in other contreis, and\nturne vs to reprof and cowardise, and thei that we shull werre\nvpon here-after shull haue of vs the lesse drede.\" Whan the princes and the Barouns herde the kynge thus\nspeke, thei were somdell a-shamed, for thei dredde\nleste he sholde holde hem cowardes, and ronne to theire armes\nin all haste, and be-gonne to assaile the castell strongly; and\nthei that were with-ynne hem deffended manly and casten out\nstones, and sharpe speres and dartes, and slough of hem I-nowe\nin the diches; and the kynge leodogan, and Cloedalis, and\nGuyomar his cosin, and hervy de rivell, and Males le bruns\nissed out armed vpon horse of prise couered with still, and\nsmote a-monge the peple of kynge Rion that by force hadde\ntake a barbican, and ledde a-wey xv sergauntes that were bolde\nand hardy, and of that harme hem thought shame; and\nCleodalis smot the kynge Margant with a spere that neither shelde\nne hauberk myght hym a-vaile, for the spere shaft shewed\nthourgh his bakke be-hynde, and he blussht down deed to\ngrounde; and whan his men saugh hym falle, thei lefte the\nprisoners and ronne thider; and whan thei founde hym deed,\nthan be-gan the cry and the noyse, and lefte the assaute, and\nCleodalis and his companye rescowed the xv men, and brought\nhem in to the Castell, and closed the yates, and thei of the hoste\nalso with-drough theire peple, and bar the deed kynge in to the\ntente of kynge Rion, that was therfore sorowfull and wroth.  But\nnow shull we leve hem makynge theire doell, and speke of the\nmessage that kynge Rion sente to kynge Arthur to Cameloth. Whan this messager was departed from his lorde, he and\nhis squyer rode forth till thei com to Cameloth on\nthe day of the assumpcion, and a-light down of his horse, and\ncom in to the halle as kay hadde sette the firste cours be-fore\nthe kynge Arthur.  This knyght saugh these kynges and these\nquenes that satte at the high deyse alle crowned for the high\nfeeste, and saugh the harpoure crowned with golde, he was all\na-stonyed, and for the dogge that hym ledde thourgh the paleis;\nand he asked of kay that served whiche was the kynge Arthur,\nand kay hym shewed a-noon right; and the knyght, that was\nwise, and well cowde speke, com be-fore the kynge, and seide\nso lowde that alle myght it vndirstonde, \"Kynge Arthur,\nI grete the nought, ffor I am not ther-to comaunded by hym\nthat hath me to the I-sente.

But sir Gawein and his companye dide\nso well in armes that thei pressed thourgh the peple of kynge\nRion, but first was ther many a hevy stroke yoven and resceived,\nand many a knyght straught deed to the erthe; and the kynge\nArthur, and the kynge looth of Orcanye, and the kynge Ban,\nand the kynge Bohors were smyte in to the bateile on a-nother\nside, where thei dide merveiles a-monge theire enmyes, ffor\na-gein theire strokes endured noon armure.

Whan Merlin hadde tolde to Blase his maister alle\nthinges as were be-fallen oon after a-nother, he soiourned with\nhym as longe as hym liked, and than toke his leve of hym\nand com streight in to the Cite of logres, where-as the kynge\nArthur and Gonnore his wif, and resceyved Merlin with grete\nioye, and a-noon as he was come.  Ther com in a maiden to\nthe halle dore, and a-light down from a mule, and hadde\nbrought be-fore hir on hir sadell a dwerf, the moste contirfet\nand foulest that eny hadde sein, ffor he was deformed ,\nand his browes reade and rowe, and his berde reade and longe,\nthat henge down to his breste, and his heeir was grete and\nblakke, and foule medled, and his sholdres high and courbe,\nand a grete bonche on his bakke be-hinde and a-nother be-fore\na-gein the breste, and his handes were grete, and his fyngres\nshort, and his legges short, and his chyne longe and sharpe, and\nthe mayden was yonge and of grete bewte, and thei were sore\nloked on of oon and other; and a-noon as she was a-light she\ntoke hir dwerf in hir armes, and toke hym down of the horse\nswetly, and brought hym in to the halle be-fore the kynge\nArthur that was sette atte mete at the high deyse, and than she\nsalued the kynge right curteisely as she that was connynge and\nwele taught, and the kynge greete hir a-gein full debonerly, and\nthan seide the mayden, \"Sir, I am come to yow from fer contrey, for the grete\nrenomede that of yow renneth thourgh the worlde;\nffor to aske and require of yow a yefte, ffor as the grete renoun\nof yow recordeth that no mayden shall faile of no request that\nshe yow demaunded, and for that ye be holde the worthiest\nkynge of the worlde.

But a-while we shull reste of hym,\nand speke of the kynge Arthur. Now seith the storie than whan the xij Massagiers were\ndeparted from the kynge Arthur, the kynge and his\nbaronye a-bide stille full wroth and angry, for the maundement\nof Luce the Emperour; and Merlin seide, \"Sir, sende for youre\npeple hastely, for the Emperour appareileth hym right\nfaste.\"  \"Merlin, frende,\" seide the kynge, \"I shall mete with hym\nsonner than he wolde.\"  \"He shall you mete,\" seide Merlin,\n\"to his damage; and a-bide here in ioy, for I go of make the\nmessage to the Barouns.\"  With that he vanysshed, that Arthur\nne wiste where he be-come; and Merlin wente first in to Orcanye\nand dide the message to the kynge looth, that with xv dayes\nhe sholde be at logres with all his power; and he seide he\nwolde so with good will, and than Merlin departed, wher-for\nsholde I make yow longe tale, he warned alle the princes and\nbarons that of the kynge arthur were holdinge to be the xv\nday at logres, saf only the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and the kynge\nBohors of Gannes; and after that he returned a-gein, and fonde\nthe kynge Arthur in his chambre, and seide, \"Your message\nis don to alle the Barouns, and thei shull be redy her fro hens\nxv dayes.\"  Whan the kynge this vndirstode he was gladde\nand ioyfull, and soiourned at logres till his baronye was come,\nand thider come the kynge looth first, and his companye with\nvj Ml men, and the kynge Vrien with iij Ml men, and the kynge\nCarados foure Ml men, and the kynge de Cent Chiualers iiij Ml , and the kynge ventres foure Ml, and the kynge Tradilyuans\niiij Ml , and the kynge Belynans iiij Ml , and the kynge Clarion\niiij Ml , and the Duke Escam ij Ml , and Gosenges and Nabunall his\nsenescall iiij Ml , and the kynge ydier iiij Ml , and the kynge\nAguysans iiij Ml ; and whan thei were alle assembled in the\nmedowes be-fore logres, the kynge Arthur was gladde, and\nthanked hem hertely, and tolde hem the outrage that the\nEmperour hadde hym sente, and thei hym counseiled to haste\nthat he were a-venged of the shame.  Than was the navie\nappereiled and entred in to shippes; and Merlyn was be-fore,\nand stinte neuer till he com to Gannes, and fonde the kynge\nBan and the kynge Bohors, and he badde hem thei sholde hem\nappereile, for the kynge Arthur is entred in to the see for to\ngo vpon the Romayns, and thei seide thei wolde be redy hym\nto mete; and Merlin returned and com to the port er the kynge\nArthur were londed, and whan he hym saugh he asked whens\nhe com; and he seide he hadde ben at Gannes for to somowne\nbothe two kynges that shull be redy with yow to mete with\ngrete companye of peple; of this thanked hym Arthur, and\nthan thei issed oute of the shippes, and logged a litill from the\nport vpon the river in tentes, and in pavilouns for to take theire\nreste of traueile that thei hadde in the see, and slept that\nnyght; and as the kynge Arthur slepte hym com a vision, that\na grete bere was on a grete mountayne, and as hym semed ther\ncom a-gein hym a grete dragon from the Clowdes of the orient,\nand caste fire and flame thourgh his throte so merveilouse that\nall the contrey ther-a-boute ther-of was light, and this dragon\nassailed the bere full fiercely, and the bere hym diffended full\nwele; but the dragon enbraced the bere as hym semed, and\ncast hym to the erthe, and hym slough. Whan the kynge a-woke he merveiled sore of his dreme,\nand made Merlyn come be-fore hym, and praied hym\ndierly to tell hym the significacion of his dreme, and than he\ntolde hym all worde for worde to Merlin as he hadde seyn in\nslepinge; and than seide Merlin, \"Sir, I shall sey you the tokeninge the bere, the bere that ye saugh signifieth a grete monstre, a grete Geaunt that is here nygh in a mountaigne that\nis come oute of the ontrey of spayne in to this londe, and here he\na-bideth, and doth the contrey shame from day to day ne noman\ndar hym a-bide for the grete force that is in hym; the dragon\nthat ye saugh in youre a-vision that caste thourgh his throte\nfire and flame so grete that all the londe ther-of was light\nsignifieth youre-self by the fire of youre hardinesse that is\nclier and feire shyninge by grace, and the dragon that assailed\nthe bere so vigerously signifieth that ye shall assaute the Geaunte,\nof that the dragon enbrased hym and caste to the erthe\nsignifieth that the Geaunte shall enbrace yow, but in the ende ye\nshull hym sle, of that be ye nothinge in doute.\"  With that thei trussed tentes and pavilons, and ride forth on theire wey,\nbut thei hadde not longe gon whan tidinges com to the kynge\nArthur of the Geaunte that distroied the londe and the contrey,\nso that ther-ynne duelled nother man ne woman, but fledde\nthourgh the feldes as bestes disolate for drede of the Geaunte,\nand hadde born by force a mayden of the contrey that was\nnyece to a lorde of the contrey that was a grete gentilman,\nand he hadde born hir with hym vp to a mounteigne,\nwhere-as he repeired that was all closed with the see, and\nthat monteigne is yet cleped the mounte seint Michel, but\nat that tyme ther was nother mynster ne chapell, ne ther\nwas no man so hardy ne so myghty that durst fight with the\nGeaunte; and whan the peple of the contrey dide hym assaile,\nthei myght not a-gein hym endure neither on londe ne on se,\nfor he slough hem with the roches, and made theire shippes to\nsinke; and the peple of the contrey fledde thourgh the wodes\nand forestes, and mounteynes with theire children in theire\narmes, and so thei lefte theire londes and theire richesses. Whan Arthur herde how the Geaunte distroied so the\nlonde, he cleped kay the stiward, and Bedyuer, and\nbadde hem make hem redy armed a-boute mydnyght, and thei\ndide his comaundement, and com to-geder thei thre and two\nsquyres only, and no mo, and rode till thei com vpon the\nmounte, and saugh a grete fire bright shynynge on that o side; and on that othir side was a-nother mounte that was not so\ngrete as that, and ther-on was a fire merveilouse grete, and thei\nwiste not to whiche thei sholde gon; than he cleped Bediuer,\nand bad hym go loke on whiche mounte the Geaunte was.  Than\nBediuer wente in to a bote that was full of the flos of the see,\nand whan he was come to the next monteyn he wente vp\nhastily on the roche, and herde grete wepinge; and whan he\nthat herde he hadde doute, ffor he wende the Geaunte hadde\nbe there, but he toke vpon hym hardynesse, and drough his\nswerde, and wente forth and hoped for to fight with hym as\nhe that for no drede of deth ne wolde be founde no cowarde,\nand in this thought he clymbed vpon the mountein; and whan\nhe was come vp he saugh the fier that was clier brennynge, and\nsaugh a tombe faste by that was newly made, and be-side that\ntombe satte an olde woman discheueled, and all to-rente hir\nheir, and wepte and sighed full sore; and whan she saugh the\nknyght, she seide, \"Haa, gentilman, what art thow, what\ndolour hath brought the in to this place, ffor with grete dolour\nthou shalt ende thy life, yef the Geaunte the finde, ffle hens\nhastely as faste as thow maist, for thou art to vn-happy yef thow\na-bide till that this deuell come that hath no pite of nothinge, fle\nhens as fer as thou maist, yef thou wilt thi lif saue.\" Whan Bediuer saugh the woman so wepe, and so pitously\nregrated helayn sighinge, and bad hym to fle but\nyef he wolde dye, and he seide, \"Good woman, lete be thy\nwepinge, and telle me what thou art, and why thou makest so\ngrete sorowe, and why thou art vpon this mounte by this tombe,\nand telle me all the occasion of thy sorowe, and who lith here\nin this sepulture.\"  \"I am,\" quod she, \"a dolerouse caitif\nthat wepe and make waymentacion, for a mayden that was\nnyece to Hoell of nauntes that I norished and yaf souke with\nmy mylk, and she lith vnder this tombe, and it was me\ncomaunded hir to norish and to kepe.  Now is ther a deuell that\nhir hath taken a-wey and brought hider her and me, and wolde\nhaue leyn by the childe that was yonge and tender.  But she\nmyght hym not svffre ne endure, for he was moche and hidiouse, and lothly, and so he made the soule departe from the body, and\nthus he be-rafte my doughter falsly and be treson, and ther\nI haue hir biried, and for hir wepe bothe day and\nnyght.\"  \"And wherfore,\" quod Bediuer, \"gost thou not hens seth thou\nart left here a-lone, and hast hir loste seth that ther is noon\nrecouer.\"  \"Sir,\" quod she, \"I knowe well ther is no recouer,\nbut for that I se ye be a gentilman, and ther-to so curteise I will kepe nothinge from youre knowinge, but I will telle yow\nthe trouthe, whan that my dere doughter was entered, for whos\nlove I wende wele haue loste my witte, and dyed for doel, the\nGeaunte made me to a-bide stille to haue his foule lecherouse\nlust vpon me, and he hath me diffouled by his strengthe that\nI moste suffre his wille whedir I wolde or noon, for I haue\nno myght a-gein hym, and I take oure lorde god to recorde\nit was neuer my will, and ner ther with he hadde me slain,\nffor with hym haue I suffred grete peyne and gret anguyssh,\nffor he is vn-mesurable grete, and he cometh hider to fulfille\nhis lecherie vpon me, and thou art but deed, and maist in no\nmaner ascape, for he cometh a-noon right, for he is ther a-bove\nin that mountayn where thou seist that fier, and ther-fore I\npray the go hens thy wey, and lef me here to compleyne, and\nmake my mone for my doughter.\" Grete pite hadde Bediuer of the woman, and moche he hir\ncounforted, and seth he com a-gein to the kynge, and\ntolde that he hadde sein, and seide how the geaunte was vpon\nthe high hill ther he saugh the grete fier and smoke.  Than\nthe kynge made his felowes go with hym vpon the mounteyne,\nand thei were come vpon the hill; than the kynge comaunded\nhis felowes to abide, and seide that hym-self alone wolde go\nfight with the Geante, \"neuertheles,\" seide the kynge, \"loke\nthat ye waite well vpon me, and yef it be myster cometh me\nto helpe,\" and thei seide thei wolde with good will, and thei\na-bide; and the kynge wente toward the Geaunte that satte\nbe-fore the fire, and rosted flessh on a spite, and kut of the side\nthat moste was I-nough, and ete it; and the kynge wente\nto-ward hym with swerde in honde drawen a softe pas gripinge his shelde, for he wende hym to haue supprised.  But the Geaunte\nthat was full false and maliciouse be-helde, and saugh the kynge\ncome and lept up, ffor the kynge hadde his swerde in his hande,\nand the Geaunte stert to a grette clobbe that stode by hym\nthat was grete and hidiouse of a plante of an oke that was a\ngrete birthon for a myghty man, and caught it from the fire,\nand leide it on his nekke, and com fiercely a-gein the kynge\nas he that was of grete force, and seide to the kynge that a\ngrete fooll was he to come ther, and reised the batte for to\nsmyte the kynge on the heed, but he was wight and delyuer,\nand lept a-side, so that he of hym failed, and ther-with the\nkynge smote at hym and wende to smyte hym on tho heed;\nbut the Geaunte that was bolde and hardy kept it on his clobbe,\nor elles hadde he be deed, neuertheles somdel he touched hym\nwith Marmyadoise his good swerde, that he conquered of the\nkynge Rion, and touched hym be-twene the two browes that\nhe wax all blinde, for the blode that ran ouer his yen, and\nthat was a thinge that sore hym greved, for he myght not se\nwhere to smyte, and be-gan to scarmyshe and to grope a-boute\nhym with his staffe as a wood devell and sore a-baisshed, and\nthe kynge hasted hym full harde but a-reche hym myght not,\nffor the Geaunte caste a-boute hym grete strokes that yef he\nhadde hym smyten he hadde ben all to-brosed, and thus thei\nfoughten longe, that the oon ne touched not that other, and\ntherfore thei were sore anoyed; and than the Geaunte wente\ntastinge here and there that he sesed the kynge by the arme;\nand whan he hadde hym caught, he was gladde and ioyfull,\nffor a-noon he wende hym to haue threst to deth, and so he\nhadde, but that the kynge was wight and delyuer, and wrast\nout of his gripinge with grele peyne, and than he ran vpon\nhym with his swerde, and smote hym on the heed and on the\nlifte sholdre that all the arme fremysshed, and so harde was the\nhide of the serpent that in the flessh myght it not atame; and\nthe Geaunte myght hym not se, ffor his iyen were all couered\nwith blode, and than he saugh the shadowe of the kynge, and\nthan he ran that wey; but the kynge that wiste he was of grete force durste not come in his handes, and so hath he gon\nvp and down that he stombeled on his clubbe, and it sesed and\nran ther as he wende to finde the kynge.  But the kynge\nblenched so that he myght hym not a-reche, and ther-fore hadde\nhe grete sorow in herte, and than he caste a-wey his clubbe and\ntasted to chacche the kynge in his armes, and so he wente\ngropinge and frotinge his iyen till he saugh the light and the\nshadowe of the kynge; and than he spronge to hym and caught\nhym by the flankes with bothe his armes that nygh he hadde\nwith his gripes brosten his chyne, than he be-gan to craspe\nafter his arme, for to take from hym his swerde out of his\nhonde.  But the kynge it well perceyved and threwe down the swerde,\nthat in the fallinge he myght here it ringe cler; and than he\ngriped the kynge with that oon hande, and stouped down to\ntake the swerde with that other hande, and in the stoupinge\nthe kynge smote hym with his kne that he fill in swowne, and\nthan he lept to the swerde and hente it vp, and stert to the\nGeaunte ther he lay, and lifte vp the serpentes skyn, and rof\nhym thourgh the body with the swerde, and so was the Geaunte\nslain; and kay the stiwarde, and Bediuer made grete ioye of the\nkynge, and be-helde the Geaunte that so grete was that wonder\nwas to be-holden, and thanked oure lorde of the honour and\nthe victorie that he hadde yove the kynge, ffor neuer hadde\nthei seyn so grete a feende; and the kynge bad Bediuer smyte\nof the heed that it myght be born in to the hoste to se the\ngrete merveile of the gretnesse of hym, and he dide his\ncomaundement, and than com down of the mounteyne, and lepe\non theire horse, and the flode was come a-gein that gretly hem\ndisesed, and with grete peyne thei passed the greves and com\na-gein to the hoste; and the Barons were sore a-baisshed for\nthe taryinge of the kynge, for that thei wiste not whider he\nwas wente, and thei were meved hym for to seche in diuerse\nparties, ne hadde ben Merlin that bad hem be nothinge dismayed,\nfor he sholde come hastely. While the princes and the barouns were in this afray, for\nthe kynge Arthur, he and the stiwarde and Bediuer com down in to his teinte, and hadde the heed of the Geaunte\ntrussed at Bediuers sadell by the heir, and thider com alle the\nBarouns whan he was a-light, and asked fro when she com,\nfor he hadde put hem in grete afray; and he seide he com fro\nthens ther he hadde foughten with the Geaunte that distroied\nso the londe and the contrey ther-aboute and how he hadde hym\nslayn thourgh the grace of oure lorde; and than he shewed hem\nthe heed that Bediuer hadde trussed, and whan the barons it\nsaugh thei blessed hem for the wonder ther-of, and seide that\nneuer in all theire lif had thei not seyn so grete an heed, and\nalle that were in the hoste preised god for the kynges victorie,\nand than thei dide vn-arme the kynge with grete ioye and\ngladnesse, and rested ther all that day, till on the morowe that thei\ntrussed teintes and Pavilouns and ride forth the streight wey\ntowarde Burgoyne, and spedde hem so in her iourneyes till thei\ncom vpon the river of Aube There is a blank in the MS.; the French MS. (fol. 206, col. 2) has \"la riuiere daube.\" and ther thei herde tidinges of\nLuce the Emperour was com a-gein hem, and than was the\nkynge Arthur gladde that he hadde founde hym so nygh, and\nsory for that he hadde so distroyed and wasted the contrey,\nand loigge his hoste by the river; and the same day com the\nkynge Ban and the kynge Bohors in to the hoste with vi Ml knyghtes and good men of werre.  But Grascien and Pharien\nne leonce of paierne were nought there, but dide a-bide to kepe\nand to diffende the londe a-gein the kynge Claudas de la desert,\nyef it were myster, and a-noon as the two kynges were come\nin to the hoste thei dide picche theire teintes be-fore the kynge\nlooth, and he made hem grete cheir and feste, for he loved hem\nhertely, and ther thei a-bide till the kynge Arthur hadde\nfortefied a Castell that thei myght repeire to yef thei hadde\nmysteir; and than sente the kynge his messages to the\nEmperour Luce by the counseile of his barouns, and sente hym to sey\nthat he was folily come vpon his londe, and but he wolde come\nto a-mendement he wolde hym chace oute of Rome; and on the\nmessage he sente sir Gawein, and Segramor, and sir Ewein, ffor that thei were curteise and well I-taught, and ther-to\nhadden grete hardynesse and high prowesse; and the kynge\nseide to sir Gawein, \"Ffeire nevew, ye shull go to the Emperour\non my message, and bidde hym returne hom a-gein, and leve\nthe londe, for it is myn, and yef he will not so, lete hym come\nto bateile, and prove whiche of vs hath right, ffor while I Live\nI shall it diffende a-gein the Romaynes, and conquered it by\nbateile, and prove it a-gein hym body for body, whiche of vs two\nshall it haue of right.\"  Whan the kynge Arthur hadde seide\nthese wordes the messagiers hem turned wele I-armed in stiell\nwith sheldes hanginge at theire nekke, and girde theire goode\nswerdes, and in theire handes grete speres; and his felowes that\nwere yonge and lusty bachelers counselled sir Gawein to do\nsoche thinge er thei returned agein, that it myght be spoken\nof euer after, and that men myght sey the werre was well\nbegonne \"wherewith the Romaynes haue vs manased;\" and thus\nthei ride till thei com nygh the hoste; and whan thei saugh the\nmessagiers comynge thei lepe oute of theire teintes on all partes\nto se hem and be-holde and for to wite what thei were com to\nseche and asked what thei were, and fro whens thei com.  But\nthei hilde with hem no ple ne wolde not stinte till thei com to\nthe Emperours teinte and ther thei a-light and made theire\nhorse to be holde with-outen.  And than thei come be-fore the\nEmperoure, and tolde hym theire message that thei brought\nfrom the kynge Arthur. \"Sir,\" quod Gawein, \"the kynge Arthur sente the to\nvndirstonde that thow voide his londe and his contrey for\nit is all his quytely and he defendeth the to be so hardy to\nsette ther-ynne foot, and yef thou wilt ought chalenge be bateile\nhe shall it diffende, ffor Romaynes had it conquered be-fore\ntyme be bateile and be bateile shall he it conquere.  Now lete it\nbe proved by bateile whiche oweth to haue the signiourie and\nthe poweste, and com forth to-morowe yef thow wilt the contre\nchalenge or elles go bak a-gein for here hast thow nought to do;\nffor we haue take the londe, and thow hast it loste, and ther-fore\nyef thow be wise do after my counseile.\" Whan the Emperour herde sir Gawein speke in this maner\nhe ansuerde with-oute more a-bidinge full sory and full\nwroth, and seide, returne wolde he not, for the londe and the\ncontrey was his, and therfore he wolde holde his wey forth, and\nhe was well plesed with soche maundementes, and yef he hadde\nhis londe loste he wolde it recouer whan he myght, and that he\ntrowed sholde be hastely.  A knyght ther was that satte by the\nEmperour that Tutillius was cleped, and was the Emperours suster sone, he ansuerde full felliche, and seide that Bretou\nns\ncoude well manece but at the dedes thei were but esy, and\ntherfore ought thei to haue the more reprof.  But sir Gawein\nther-with wrathed and drough his swerde, and lept to hym and\nsmote of his heed, and than he bad his felowes go to theire\nhorse lightly, and a-noon thei dide his comaundement, and\nGawein lepte on his horse also with-oute other leve-takinge\nnother of the Emperour ne of the romayns, and than was all\nthe court trouble and full of romur, ffor the Emperour cried,\n\"Take hem and lete hem not ascape.\"  Than thei cried, \"Ore\nas armes.\"  Ther sholde ye haue seyn peple arme hem in euery\nside and lepe to horse, and prike after the messengiers, and\nthei ride forth a grete randon, and the Romayns com after hem\non euery side by the weyes thourgh the feldes here v, here iiij,\nhere vj or vij.  Oo knyght ther was that richely was horsed\nand passed alle his felowes, and cried to the massegers full\nfiercely, \"Parde ye shull a-bide, for I shall delyuer yow to the\nEmperour.\"  Whan sir Gawein this herde, he griped his shelde,\nand turned his horse and hym hitte so harde that he bar hym\ndeed to the erthe; and than he seide, \"Now is it werse for\nthe that thyn horse was so swifte, for thou hadest ben better\nhaue be a myle be-hynde, or a-biden stille in the hoste;\" and\nSegramor lete renne to a knyght that com shovinge after hym,\nand he smote hym thourgh the throte that he fill deed vp-right;\nand than he seide, \"Sir knyght, with soche morsels I can yow\nfede and myn other enmyes.  Now be stille ther and a-bide hem\nthat come after, and telle hem that this wey gon the messagiers\nof the kynge Arthur, that is theire rightfull lorde.\" After hym com a knyght that was born in Rome, and come\nof high lynage, and was cleped Marcell, he satte on a\nstronge horse, and a swyfte, and hadde no spere for grete haste;\nhe ouer-toke sir Gawein, and seide he sholde hym yelde to the\nEmperour, and Gawein loked and saugh hym come costinge his\nwey, and turned his horse at the passinge forth, and Gawein\nhym smote so harde in to the brain so depe that the swerde\nentred to the teth, and Gawein that seide, \"Thow haddest to\nmoche haste, thou myght better haue come be-hynde.\"  Than\nthei turned alle thre, and smote down thre romayns deed.  A\nknyght ther was that was cosin to Marcell, and satte on a\nstronge horse that was swyfte, and was sory for his nevew that\nhe saugh ly deed, and be-gan to prike ouerthwert the felde, and\nsir Ewein it saugh and ran that wey, and smote hym so harde\nthat he hadde no leiser to turne a-gein, for ther he loste his\nheed, and thre romayns brake theire speres vpon sir Ewein, and\nhe smote of the heed of that oon, and the arme of the seconde,\nand smote the thirde vpon the helme that he fill from his horse\nto the erthe, and than he wente forth after his felowes, and the\nromains hem chaced till thei com to a wode that was nygh the\ncastell that kynge Arthur hadde fortefied.  But now we shull\nstinte a while of the messengers, and speke of the kynge Arthur. Whan Arthur hadde sente his message to Luce the\nEmperour he sent after hem vj Ml men by the counseile\nof Merlin for to socour hem, yef it were myster, and thei rode\ntill thei com to the wode, and ther thei a-bide on horsbak till\nthei saugh hem comynge, and after hem all the feilde couered\nwith knygthes and horsemen that chaced the knyghtes that were\nmessagiers, and whan thei saugh this thei spronge oute of the\nwode hem a-geins, and the romayns resorte a-noon right as thei\nsaugh hem come, and many of hem were wroth that thei hadde\nchaced hem so fer, ffor the bretons than hem chaced full crewelly,\nand ther was many of hem taken and many slain.  A knyght\nther was of grette renoun, whos name was Petrius, ffor in Rome\nwas not his pareill of prowesse and of hardynesse, and herde\nspeke of this a-wayte that the Bretouns hadde made, and a-noon he rode thider with vj Ml men of armes, and as soone as he was\ncome in to the stour, he made the bretons be fin force entre in to\nthe wode, for thei myght not hym and his peple endure, but\nturned to flight, and the chace dured to the wode, and ther\nthei stode at diffence, and Petrius hem assailed full vigerously,\nbut many he loste of his men, ffor the Bretouns slough of hem\ngrete plente, and many ther were deed on bothe sides. Whan Arthur saugh the messangiers taried so longe, he\neleped ydier the sone of Vunde and comaunded hym\nto go after hem till he hadde hem founden, and he dide his\ncomaundement and rode forth till he fonde bothe hostes that\nfought to-geder, and sir Gawein and his felowes dide merveiles\nand wele, and ydiers and his companye spronge in vpon the\nRomayns fiercely, and than com alle the bretouns oute of the\nwode, and haue recouered the felde; and Petrius that was a noble\nknyght, and bolde and hardy, relied his peple a-boute hym, and\ncowde well fle and returne at a vauntage, and well fight with\nhis enmyes, and who that will mete an hardy knyght lete hym\ngo to hym, ffor whom that he smote died hym be-houed, and\nthe bretouns pressed to the bateile as thei that were desirous to\nIuste and covetouse to do chiualrie, so that thei rought not how\nit yede so the werre were be-gonne; and on that other side was\nPetrius full dolent, and kepte his felowes clos a-boute hym, and\nSegramor of Costantinnoble wente thourgh the bateile smytinge\ndown knyghtes and horse, and was war of Petrius that threwe\ndown bretouns, and maymed and slough, and saugh wele by the\nmerveiles that he dide that soone myght the bretouns have grete\nlosse, but yef Petrius were deed or taken quyk, ffor by his\nprowesse all only a-boode alle the Romayns, and Gawein toke\ncounseile of the beste of his frendes, and seide, \"We haue\nbe-gonne this stour with-oute the leve of kynge Arthur, and yef\nit happen vs wele he will conne vs thanke.

Than Segramor shof that wey as he saugh Petrius, and alle\nhis felowes after that neuer thei stinte till thei come in\nto the place ther Petrius gouerned his meyne, and Segramor\nspored his horse so nygh, that he caught hym in his armes that\nthei bothe fill to the erthe as he that trusted wele vpon his\nfelowes, and he lay at the erthe, and griped him sore in his\narmes; and Petrius peyned hym sore to a-rise and turned\nwraste-linge; but all that availed not, ffor Segramor helde hym faste so\nthat he hadde no power to meve; and whan the Romayns saugh\nhym falle thei pressed hym for to rescowe, and ther was harde\nstour and rough medle, and Gawein com thourgh the presse\nmakinge wey with the trenchaunt suerde, wherwith he slough\ndown right all that stode in his wey, so that ther was no\nromayn so hardy ne so myghty but he made hym wey; and\nydiers the sone of vut made grete lardure of Romayns; and sir\nEwein the sone of kynge Vrien so peyned hym to perce the\npresse, that eche of hem laboured for other so vigerously that\nthei haue remounted Segramor by force, and sette hym on horse,\nand take Petrius that sore was beten, and diffouled, and haue\nhym drawen oute of the presse be fin force, and delyuered hym\nto goode wardeynes, and returned a-gein in to the stour, and\nthe Romayns that hadde no gouernour hadde loste theire diffence\nwhan he was gon that hem dide condite; and the bretuons hem\nslough and caste to grounde so thikke that thei passed ouer\ngrete hilles of deed bodyes to pursue hem that fledde, and thei\nslough many in the chace, and toke prisoners and hem bounden\nand presented the kynge Arthur, and the kynge hem thanked\nhertely; and than thei counseiled hym to sende hem in to the\nreame of Benoyk, and sette hem ther in prison till the Romayns\nhadde don his plesier, ffor yef he kept hem in the hoste thei\nmyght hem wele ascape.  Than the kynge cleped Borell, and\nRicher, and Cador, and Bediuer, that were gode knyghtes and\nhardy, and of grete perage, and comaunded hem to a-rise erly on the morowe, and conveye the prisoners till thei were in saf warde;\nand here shull we reste of the prisoners, and of hem that shull\nhem conveye, and speke of the Emperour. Whan the Emperour wiste of the damage that his men\nhadde resceived, he was full of dolour and wrath, and\nthan com asspies that seide how the prisoners sholde on the\nmorowe be ledde in to the londe of Benoyk; whan the\nEmperour herde this, he made x Ml men lepe to horse, and traueile\nall nyght for to come be-fore ther the prisoners sholde passe,\nand hem to rescowe yef it myght be; and than the Emperour\ncleped Gestoire that was lorde of lybee, and the kynge of\nSurre that Euander was cleped, and Calidus of Rome, and\nMaus, and Cathenois.  These v cowde skile of bateile, and\nmoche thei knewe of werre, and the Emperour hem comaunded\nto condite these x Ml , and than departed these v princes with\nalle these x Ml men, and rode till thei come in to the wey ther as\nthese prisoners sholde passe, and ther thei a-bode stille in a\ndelitable place that thei fonde nygh the wey.  And on the morowe\na-roos the meyne of kynge Arthur as thei were comaunded, and\nledde the prisoners, and rode in two parties for doute of peple,\nand hem condited Bretell, and Richer, and Cador, and the\ncompanye ther the prisoners were made hem be ledde with\ntheire handes bounden be-hynde at theire bakke, and theire\nfeet vndir the horse belyes; and thei that wente be-fore blusht\nvpon the wacche of the Romayns; and the Romains spronge out\nhem a-geins so harde that the erthe trembled, and the bretouns\nhem diffended as peple of grete vertu; and whan Bediuer that\ncom be-hynde herde the strokes resounde he made lede the\nprisoners in to a sure place, and comaunded the squyres hem to\nkepe, and than smote theire horse with the spores, and wolde\nnot stinte till thei com to here felowes, and hem diffended with\ngrete force and vigour; and the romains shof here and there,\nand hadde not so grete entente to disconfite the bretouns as for\nto rescowe the prisoners and hem to seche; and whan the\nbretouns saugh hem thus demended, thei departed in foure\nbateiles, and Cador hadde in his companye the peple of Cornewaile, and Bediuer the peple of bediers, and Richer hadde a\ncompanye of his owne peple, and Bretell hadde hem of Galvoye;\nwhan the kynge Evander saugh his peple turne to disconfiture,\nand that theire force be-gan to amenuse, he gadered hem a-boute\nhym clos; and whan thei saugh the bretons recouer, thei ronne\nvpon hem in ordre, and than be-gonne a stour right grete; and\nthan hadde the bretons moche the werse, for thei loste grete\nplente of theire knyghtes, and ydiers le fitz vut was mette so\nsore with the kynge Euander, that he fill deed to the erthe, and\nther-fore were the bretons sore dismayed, for thei loste moche\npeple at that shoofte, and alle thei hadde be deed or taken;\nbut as Cleodalis the Senescall of Carmelide com with v Ml men\nthat the kynge Arthur hadde sent by the counseile of Merlin;\nand whan Bedyuer hem perceived, he seide to his companye,\n\"Holde stille now, and fle not, lo here cometh socour;\" and\nthan thei cried the signe of kynge Arthur so high, that Cleodalis\ncom with v Ml men, and the Romayns entended to take the\nbretouns, and toke no tent to hem of Carmelide till thei were\nfalle, euen vpon hem, and in theire comynge thei ouerthrewe\na hundred of romayns that neuer rise after.  And than the\nromayns were alle a-baisshed, ffor thei wende it hadde be the\nkynge Arthur, and his power; and so thei were dismayed that\nthei fledde toward theire herberges, for thei coueited noon other\ngarison, and these hem chaced that cowde hem not love, and\nin that chace was slayn the kynge Euander, and Chachelos, and\nof other moo than two thousande, and many ther were taken\nprisoners; and than thei repeired in to the feelde of the bateile,\nand toke the erle bourell and other deed cors that lay thourgh\nthe felde, and hem biried, and bar a-wey hem that were wounded;\nand these that the kynge hadden comaunded to kepe and conveie\nthe prisoners thei ledde hem forth, and other that thei hadde\ntaken in the bateile newly, and bounde hem streite, and sent\nhem thider as thei were comaunded; and Cleodalis and his\ncompanye returned to the kynge Arthur, and tolde hym how\nthei hadde spedde.  But here a-while we shull reste of hem,\nand speke of the Emperour luce. Full of sorowe was the Emperour whan he knewe the\ndiscounfiture, and the grete losse of his peple, and\nwepte full tendirly for the kynge Euander, and for other that\nwere deed and taken, and saugh well the myschef, and that\ndismayed hym sore, and was in doute whedir he sholde fight\nwith the kynge Arthur, or he sholde a-bide his rere-warde that\nsholde come after; and than he hym be-thought and made his\npeple lepe to horse and come to logres with all his hoste, and\nloigge hym in the vales vnder the Citee; and whan the kynge\nArthur wiste that, he wiste well that he wolde not fight, though\nhe hadde more peple, and so wolde not he suffre hym soiourne\nne sitte nygh hym, and made prevely his peple lepe to horse,\nand rode on the right side of the Cite be-twene the town and\nthe hoste of the Emperour, and lefte the hoste on the left side,\nand that was to disavaunce the Emperour, and by-reve hym the\nwey to Oston, and laboured all the nyght till on the morowe,\nand com in to a valeye that was cleped Toroise, and that was\nthe streight wey fro Oston to logres; and ther the kynge made\nto arme his companye lest the romayns com vpon hem, and that\nthei myght lightly put hem bakke; and the cariage, and the\nmene peple that hadde no myster of bateile, the kynge made\nhem to a-bide by an hill, and made a mustre of armed peple that\nyef the romayns hem saugh thei sholde be dismayed for the\ngrete multitude of peple; after that the kynge sette in a wode\nvj Ml kynghtes vij C lxvj, and comaunded hem to the Erle of\nGloucester to lede, whiche was bothe Duke and Castelein, and\nthe kynge hem comaunded that thei sholde not meve thens in no\nmaner till thei saugh the nede.  \"And yef I haue myster,\" seide\nthe kynge, \"I shall turne to yow, and yef the Romayns turne to\ndiscounfiture, loke ye hem not spare;\" and thei hym ansuerde\nthat so thei wolde do with good chere, and than tolde the kynge\na-nother companye of knyghtes that were well appareile, and\nsette hem in a place, and hym-self was constable; and ther was\nhis prevy meyne that he hadde norisshed, and made his dragon\nto be holde in myd wey for a signe; and than departed his peple\nin viij parties, and putte in each Partye ij Ml knyghtes, and the half were on foote, and half on horse-bak, and tolde to eche\npartie in what maner thei sholde hem contene, and also he putt\nto so moche peple, that in eche partie was viij Ml and v C , and so\nhadde the kynge Aguysans the first bateile, and that other\nledde the Duke Escam of Cambenyk, and Belcys the Danoys\nkynge, and the kynge Looth of Orcanye ledde a-nother.  And the\nkynge Tradilyuans of North walis, and sir Gawein was with\nthe kynge Looth as he that was a kynge of grete pris; after these\niiij firste bateiles that wente be-fore come iiij other after wele\na-raied, of whiche the kynge Vrien ledde the firste, and with hym\nwas sir Ewein his sone, and Ewein a-voutres, and the kynge\nBelynans, and the kynge Ventres, and hadde in her companye\nthe peple of her companye and contrey.  The seconde bateile of\nthese foure ledde the kynge de Cent chiualers, and the kynge\nClarion of Northumbirlonde, and the kynge Carados, and in\ntheire companye the peple of theire contreyes.  The thridde\nbateile ledde the kynge Bohors, and thei of his contre, and\nCleodalis the Senescall of Carmelide, and thei that he brought\noute of his contrey; the fourthe of these iiij, and the laste ledde the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and hadde with hym alle the\nsergeauntes, and arblastiers, and iiij Ml men wele horsed; and\nwhan the kynge hadde stablisshed his peple and his bateiles\ndevised, he seide to his barons and to his people, \"Lordes, now\nit shall be sene how wele ye will do; ffor all that euer ye haue\ndon in all youre lif is loste, but ye do well at this tyme a-gein\nthese Romayns;\" and the princes hym ansuerde a-noon with oo\nvoice that lever hadde thei to die in the felde, but he hadde the\nhonoure and the victorie; and whan the kynge Arthur herde this\nhe was gladde and ioyfull.  But now shull we returne to speke\nof the Emperour. Here seith the book, that whan the Emperour was loiged\nin the vale vnder logres, he and his Baronye that were\nnoble knyghtes and sure, that ther he lay that nyght, and on\nthe morowe he departed from logres, and wende to go to Oston,\nand than com tidinges how the kynge Arthur hadde leide a-waite\na-gein hym, and so he saugh wele that he moste nede fight or elles returne, and that wolde he not do in no maner, ffor that\nsholde be holde cowardise, and yef he fledde his enmyes wolde\nhym chace on euery side, and do hym anoy and damage, and the\ntwo thinges myght not oon do lightly bothe to fle and to\nfight.  Than he made his princes come be-fore hym, wher-of he hadde\ntwo hundred of hem that were of his counseile; and than he\nspake to hem and seide, \"Gentill knyghtes, good conquerours,\nthe sones of good auncestrie, that the grete honours and londes\nconquered, by theire grete prowesse and hardynesse is Rome\nthe heed of the worlde; and yef this Empire falle in youre\ntyme it were shame to yow, ffor bolde and hardy were youre\nauncestres, and by reson of gentill fader ought come gentill\nissue, youre fadres vailaunt and worthi, and eueriche of yow\nought to enforce hym to resemble his fader, ffor grete shame\noueth he to haue that leseth the heritage of his fader, and that\nfor slouthe lete falle that his fader conquered, not that ye be\neuell ne a-peired.  Thei were bolde and profitable, and so I\nholde yow the same; and the bretons haue be-rafte vs the wey\ntoward Oston, that we may not passe but by bateile; take youre\narmes and a-dubbe yow, and yef thei vs a-bide loke that thei be\nwell beten, and yef thei fle we shull hem pursue by force, and\npeyne vs to a-bate theire pride, and distroie theire powestee.\" Than the romayns ordeyned theire bateiles, and theire\nsheltrons renged, and many a paynym medled a-monge\nthe cristein peple that were come to deserue theire fees and\ntheire londes that thei hilde of Rome, and many of hem on\nfoote, and many on horse, and sette some on the hill, and some\nin the valey.  Than sholde ye haue herde grete sown of hornes\nand trumpes, and mules and Olyfauntes, and thei ride forth clos\nholdinge till thei fill on the wacche of kynge Arthur, and than\nsholde ye haue sey shotte of arowes and quarelles fle so thikke\nthat noon durste discouer his heed, and after that com thei to\nbrekinge of speres vpon the sheldes; and whan the speres were\nspent thei gripe the axes, and gleves, and swerdes, and smyte\nsore vpon helmes and hauberkes, ffor ther was stour merveilous\nand sore fight; ther was no nede of foles ne of cowardes, for longe thei foughten to-geder and hurteled, that neuer the\nRomayns ne rused ne the bretons myght nought recouer vpon\nhem, ne noon wiste whiche hadde the better ne the victorie, till\nthat the warde of kinge Vrien and kynge Ventre, and kynge\nBelynans frusshed a-monge the Romayns with all theire peple\nwhere thei saugh the thikkest presse, and the thre princes\nsmyten in wonderfully, and kay the stiward that was in theire\ncompanye dide as a noble knyght; ffor the thre Princes seide,\n\"Mercy god whiche a stiward is this;\" and the same thei\nseide of Bediuer the constable, and ther was many a knyght\nleide to grounde, and many deed, and many grete strokes yoven\nand resceived, and kay and Bediuer dide merveiles, for thei\ntrusted in theire prowesse, and hilde hem to-geder, and a-vaunced\nto fer forth, and mette a bateile that the kynge of mede dide\nbringe, and his name was Boclus, a paynym of grete prowesse,\nand thei medled with hem and her peple, and many thei slough;\nand whan the kynge boclus saugh the two knyghtes that dide\nhym so grete damage of his peple, he was sory, and hilde a\ngrete short spere, and ran to Bediuer, and smote hym with so\ngrete ire, that the stele heed passed thourgh the bouke; and\nyef he hadde touched hym a litill lower, deed hadde ben for euer,\nand neuertheles he bar hym down to the erthe out of his sadill\nall in swowne; whan kay saugh hym falle, he hadde grete\nsorowe at his herte, ffor he wende verily he hadde be deed, and\ncom toward hym with as moche people as he myght, and made\ntheym of mede resorten, and com to Bedyuer, and clipte hym in\nhis armes, and wolde haue born hym oute of the presse from\nthe horse feet for the grete love that was hem be-twene, and the\nkynge of Mede hym turned and smote kay with his suerde vpon\nthe helme that he yaf hym a grete wounde on the heed so that\nhe be-houed to lete Bedyuer ly stille, and bothe hadde thei\nsoone haue be slain ne hadde be theire meyne that full stifly\nhem diffended; and a knyght spronge in to the presse that was\ncleped Segras, and was nevew to Bediuer; and whan he saugh\nhis vncle so ly at erthe, he wende he hadde be deed, and he\nassembled his kyn and frendes that were well thre hundred, and seide, \"Seweth after me, and lete vs a-venge the deth of\nmyn vncle.\"  Than he lefte the Romayns, and a-spide the kynge\nof mede, and turned that wey, and cried the signe of kynge\nArthur as a wood man oute of witte for angre to a-venge the\ndeth of his vncle, and his felowes sewed after hym with sharp\ngrounden speres wher-with was slain many a paynym; and\nwhan Segars saugh the kynge Boclus that hadde smyte down\nhis vncle, he smote hym on the helme with so grete ire, that he\ncleft hym to the teth that he fill deed to grounde, and than he\nlight down and caught hym vp, and hym lede on his horse and\nbrought hym ther as his vncle lay, and ther he hewe hym in to\nsmale peces; and than he seide to his peple, \"Sle these hethen\nhoundes, that in oure lorde haue no creaunce;\" and with that\nhe herde his oncle sighe, and than was he gladde in herte, and\ntoke hym vp softely, and bar hym oute of the presse to the\nharneys, and than returned to the bateile that was full crewell\nand fell; and the kynge Ventres mette the kynge Alipatin, and\nthe kynge Ventres was wounded thourgh the body, ffor the\nRomayns were of so grete powere that the bretouns be-hoved to\nrusen of fin force; and whan sir Gawein and hoell of the litill\nBretayne saugh hem resorte, thei were wroth and sory.  Than\nthei smote in a-monge hem, and the peple of the litill Bretayne\nhem slough euer nygh theire lorde, so that no presse myght hem\nwith-stonde, and so wele thei dide that thei made them turne\ntheire bakkes to hem and fledde, and ther was many slain and\nthrowe to grounde; and in this wise thei hem demened till thei\ncom to the maister Gawfanon of the Egle of golde, and ther was\nthe Emperour, and the myghtiest men of the worlde, and the\ngrettest gentles of Rome. Ther sholde ye haue seyn stiffe stour and fell, and crewell\nbateile, and hermans that was Erle of Tripill was in\ncompanye of sir Gawein and hauell, but a knaue hym slough\nwith a gauelok, and the peple of the Emperour smyte so on the\nbretouns that thei slough of hem two thousande in the self place\nwher-of was grete damage and pite, for thei were full worthi\nmen and many noble knyghtes, and whan sir Gawein saugh his companye thus dye, he spronge in a-monge the Romayns as a\nwood lyon a-monge wilde bestes, and he was of noble high\nprowesse, and was not wery to smyte grete strokes vpon eyther\nside till he com nygh the Emperour; and whan he saugh the\nEmperour he knewe hym wele, and he hym also, and a-noon that\noon lete renne to that other, and smyten to-geder with grete\nmyght, but thei dide not falle, for bothe were thei of grete force;\nand the Emperour was right stronge and hardy, and was gladde\nthat he was mette with Gawein, for he knewe hym by his armes\nthat men hym hadde devised, and the signes, and seide to\nhymself, yef I may ascape a-lyve, I may ther-of a-vaunte me at\nRome.  Than he griped his swerde, and couered hym with his\nshelde, and faught with sir Gawein full fiercly, and sir Gawein\nhym smote with Calibourne his good suerde, that he slitte his\nhelme, and his heed down to the teth; and whan the romayns\nsaugh the Emperour deed, thei ronne vpon the bretouns and\nyaf hem a dispitouse shour and crewell, and smyte down in her\ncomynge moo than thre hundred; whan Arthur saugh the\nromayns recouer, and his peple so demene, he cried with an high\nvoyce, \"What lordinges, what do ye holde stille youre grounde,\nand lete noon of hem ascape, for I am the kynge Arthur, that\nfor no man will forsake the felde; sewe me, and loke ye be not\nrecreaunt, and remembre you of youre noble prowesses that so\nmany remes haue conquered, ffor ther shall noon passe quyk\noute of this felde, but I haue the victorie vpon these romayns,\nffor this day shall I lyve or dye;\" with that he spronge in\na-monge the romains, and be-gan to smyte down knyghtes, and\nhorse and men, that whom so he a-raught be-houed to dye, ffor\nhe smote no stroke with his swerde, but he slough other man or\nhorse, and in his wey he mette hestor the kynge lubye, and he\nsmote hym so that his heed fill to grounde; and than he seide,\n\"Cursed be thow that euer thou hider com to do vs soche\ndamage to my men;\" and after he smote Polibetes, the kynge of\nmede, that he fonde in his wey, that he fill deed to grounde;\nwhan the barouns saugh the kynge Arthur do so wele, thei\nassailed the romayns, and the romayns hem vigerously, that grete damage dide to the bretons, and yef the Emperour ne\nhadde be slain, the bretouns ne myght not a-gein hem endured,\nfor that discounforted hem alle; neuertheles thei contened hem so\nwele, that noon wiste who sholde haue the better.

Full gladde was the kynge Arthur of the discounfiture of\nthe Romains, and of the victorie that god hadde hym\nyoven, and than com in to the feelde ther the bateile hadde be\nand biryed the deed bodies in chirches and abbeyes of the\ncontrey; and the wounded lete hem be ledde to townes, and\nserched theire sores, and after made take the body of the\nEmperour, and sente it to Rome on a beere, and sente worde to the\nromains that it was the trewage of Bretaigne, that he sent to\nRome, and yef thei wolde aske eny more he wolde hem sende\nsoche a-nother in the same wise; and whan he hadde don thus,\nhe toke counseile wheder he sholde holde forth his wey, or\nturne a-gein in to Gaule, and the princes seide he sholde take\ncounseile of Merlin.

Than the\nkynge comaunded to trusse and to make hym redy to ride; and\nthei dide his comaundement, and toke theire wey toward the\nlak de losane, and fonde the contrei wasted and voide of peple,\nthat nother man ne woman durste ther-ynne enhabite.  And\nthei laboured so till that thei com vnder the mounte, wher-as\nthis devell dide a-bide; and loiged hem in a valey a myle fro the\nmountein; and the kynge Looth toke his armes, and sir Gawein,\nand Gaheries, and the kynge Ban, and Merlin, for to go with\nthe kynge Arthur, and seide thei wolde go se this feende that so\ngrete damage and harme hadde don in the contrey; and thei\nclymbe vpon the mountein as Merlin hem ledde, that well knewe\nthe wey, for the grete witte that was in hym.  And whan thei\nwere come vp, than seide Merlin to Arthur, \"Sir, in that roche\nther is the Catte;\" and shewed hym a grete cave in a medowe\nthat was right large and depe.  \"And how shall the Catte come\noute?\" seide the kynge.  \"That shull ye se hastely,\" quod\nMerlin, \"but loke ye be redy you to diffende, for a-noon he\nwill yow assaile.\"  \"Than drawe yow alle a-bakke,\" seide the\nkynge Arthur, \"for I will preve his power;\" and thei dide his\ncomaundement, and a-noon as thei were with-drawen, Merlin\nwhistelid lowde; and whan the catte that herde, a-noon he\nlept out of the cave, for he wende that it had be som wilde\nbeste, and he was hungry and fastinge, and ran woodly a-straye\ntoward the kynge Arthur; and as soone as the kynge saugh hym\ncomynge he bar a-gein hym a short spere, and wende to smyte\nhym thourgh the body.  But the feend caught the steill heed in\nhis teth so harde, that he made it bende, and in the turnynge\nthat the kynge made, the shaft to brake faste by the heed that\nwas in the cattes mowthe; and he be-gan to make a grym noyse as he were wood, and the kynge caste down the tronchon of the\nspere, and drough his suerde, and caste his shelde hym be-fore;\nand the catte lepte to hym a-noon, and wende to sese hym by\nthe throte, and the kynge lifte the shelde a-gein hym so fiercely,\nthat the catte fill to grounde; but soone he lepte vpon his feet\nand ran vpon the kynge full fiercely, and the kynge lifte vp the\nsuerde and smote the catte on the heed that he cutte the skyn;\nbut the heed was so harde that he myght not entre; and\nneuertheles he was so astonyed, that he fill to the erthe vp-right,\nbut er the kynge myght his shelde recouer, the catte sesed hym\nat discouert be the sholdres so harde that his clawes griped\nthourgh his hauberke in to the flesshe, and plukked so harde\nthat he braste moo than iiij C mayles, that the reade blode\nfolowed his clawes, and ther failed but litill that the kynge\nhadde falle to the erthe; and whan the kynge saugh his blode,\nhe was wonder wroth, than he caste his shelde be-fore his\nbreste, and hilde his swerde in his right hande, and ran to the\ncatte vigerously, that likked his clawes that were weet of blode;\nand whan he saugh the kynge come toward hym, he lepe hym\na-geins, and wende to sese hym as he hadde do be-forn, but the\nkynge launched his shelde hym be-fore, and the catte smote\nther in his two feet be-fore with so grete fiersnesse thourgh\nthe shelde, and breied so harde that the kynge enclyned to the\nerthe, so that the gige of the shelde fly from his nekke; but he\ngriped the shelde so faste by the enarmynge that the catte\nmyght it not hym be-reve, ne pulle oute his clawes, but henge\nin the shelde be the two feet be-fore; and whan the kynge\nsaugh this, he griped faste the shelde and smote hym with his\nswerde vpon bothe legges, that he cutte hem a-sonder by the\nknees, and the catte fill to grounde; and the kynge caste a-wey\nhis shelde, and ran to hym with swerde drawen; and the catte\nsterte vpon the hynder-feet, and grenned with his teth, and\ncoveited the throte of the kynge; and the kynge launched at\nhym and wende to smyte hym on the heed, and ther-with the\ncatte strayned hys hynder feet and lept in his visage, and griped\nhym with her hynder feet, and with hir teth in to the flesshe that the blode stremed out in many places of breste and sholdres\non high; and whan the kynge felte hym holde so harde, he sette\nthe point of his swerde to the bely for to launche hym thourgh,\nand whan the catte felte the suerde she lefte hir bitinge, and\nwolde haue falle to grounde; but the two hynder feet were so\ndepe ficched in the hauberke, that the heed of the catte hanged\ndown-warde, and than the kynge smote a-sonder the two hynder\nfeet, and the body fill to grounde; and as soone as the catte\nwas fallen she be-gan to whowle and to bray so lowde, that it\nwas herde thourgh the hoste; and whan she hadde caste this\ncry she be-gan to crepe faste down the foreste by the grete\nstrengthe that was in hir, and drough toward the cave where-as\nshe com oute; but the kynge wente be-twene hir and the cave,\nand ran vpon the catte, and the catte launched toward hym,\nand wende to cacche hym with hir teth; but in the launchinge\nthe kynge smote of hir two legges be-fore, and than Merlin and\nthe other ronne to hym, and asked how it was with\nhym.  \"Well,\" seide the kynge, \"blessed be oure lorde, ffor I haue\nslain this devell, that grete harme hath don in this contrey, and\nwite it verily that I hadde neuer so grete doute of my-self as\nI hadde now a-gein this catte, saf only of the Geaunte that I\nslough this other day on the mountein, and ther-fore I thanke\noure lorde.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the barouns, \"ye haue grete cause.\"\nThan thei loked on the feet that were lefte in the shelde, and\nin the hauberk, and thei seide that neuer soche feet hadde thei\nsein be-fore, and Gaheries toke the shelde and wente to the\nhost makinge grete ioye; and whan the princes saugh the feet\nand the clawes that were so longe thei were a-baisshed, and\nledde the kynge to his tente and vnarmed hym, and loked on\nthe cracchinges, and the bitinge of the catte; and the leches\nwaisshed softly his woundes, and leide ther-to salue and\noynementes to clense the venym, and dight hym in soche maner,\nthat he letted nothinge to ride; and that day thei soiourned till\non the morowe that thei returned toward Gaule, and the kynge\nlete bere the shelde with the cattes feet, and the feet that were\nin the hauberk lete put in a cofer, and comaunded to be well kept; and the kinge asked Merlin how this mountein was\ncleped, and Merlin seide that peple of the contrey cleped it the\nmountein de lak, ffor the lak that was in the valey.  \"Certes,\"\nseide the kynge, \"I will that this name be taken a-wey, and\nI will it be cleped the mountain of the catte, ffor the catte hadde\nther his repeire, and was ther slain;\" and after that the name of\nthat hill neuer chaunged, ne neuer shall while the worlde\ndureth; and now a-while cesseth the tale and returneth to hem\nthat ledde the Prisoners. Now seith the storie, that whan the kynge Arthur hadde\ncomaunded the knyghtes to lede the prisoners of the\nromayns that were repeired from the disconfiture of the romayns\nthat the prisoners wende to haue rescowed, that thei toke the\nprisoners that the squyers kepte out of the stour, and wente\ntoward fraunce, and in euery town that thei com thei toke\ncondite fro oo town to a-nother, and laboured day and nyght\ntill thei com nygh a Castell that longe to Claudas de la desert;\nand ther com a-gein hem xlv knyghtes of the londe of kynge\nClaudas, that by theire esspies wiste that the kynge Arthur\nsente prisoners in to fraunce that were knyghtes of the romains,\nand yef they myght yelde hem to kynge Claudas he sholde\nconne hem grete thanke, ffor he loved the romayns and the\nEmperour.  Thei were well horsed and a-raied, and com a-gein\nhem that ledde the prisoners that were well CC knyghtes and\nsquyres, and of hem of the contrey that bar hem companye;\nbut with-oute faile thei ne were but xl knyghtes, and thei on\nthat other side were xlvj, and were nygh the castell where-ynne\nwere I-nowe of squyres and sergeauntes on foote in whom thei\ntrusted moche.  Thei en-busshed hem in a grove a litill oute\nof the wey; and whan thei saugh hem come, thei spronge oute\na-gein hem, and hem assailed that nygh thei haue hem\nsupprised; but a-noon as thei saugh hem breke, thei ronne hem\na-geins, and mette so harde vpon the sheldes that thei perced\nand rente hauberkes, and many ther were smyte thourgh the\nbodies, and slain and wounded on bothe parties; and whan thei\nthat were with the prisoners saugh the knyghtes reuerse, thei ronne hem to socour, and for to take the other, and grete was\nthe afray and the medle, and gretly were a-peired the peple\nof kynge Claudas, and yet sholde thei haue hadde more\ndamage; but as the peple of the Castell hem socoured, be\nstrengthe that were well an hundred and fifty of horsemen, and\nthe bateile wax right sharpe and fierce, for the bretouns were\nstronge and hardy, and Claudas peple were stronge and hardy\nin her owne londe, and diffended hem wele; and than com\noute of the castell fifty sergeauntes with bowe and arowes, and\nbe-gonne to shete at the bretouns, and slough many in her\ncomynge, and ther-fore were the bretouns sore dismayed, and\nof fin force were made resorte to the prisoners that the yomen\non foote dide kepe; and elles hadde the bretouns all loste ne\nhadde be oon auenture that hem be-fill, as god wolde, ffor\nPharien of Trebes and leonce of Paierne com that wey for to\nprise the Castell, and hadde in her companye vij C knyghtes wele\nhorsed and richely armed, and com vpon hem fightinge euen as\nthe bretouns were at disconfiture; and whan thei of the castell\nhem a-perceived, and knewe theire armes thei were sore\ndismayed, and lefte the assaute of the bretouns and fledde toward\nthe castell, and gat in who that myght sonest, that the sone\na-boode not the fader, ne the fader the sone, but so faste cowde\nthei not haste, but that leonce, and Pharien, and her companye\nslough of hem moo than xxx; and thei ronne in to the castell\nto garison, and thei vpon the walles lete falle the portcolys vpon\nhem and slough of hem two horse; and Pharien and leonce\nrepeired toward the bretouns that hadde gadered a-gein alle\nthe prisoners that thei ledde; and Pharien hem asked what thei\nwere, and thei ansuerde, \"We be with the kynge Arthur that\nthese prisoners sendeth in to ffraunce;\" and whan thei\nvndirstode this, thei seide thei were welcome.  Than thei wente alle\nto-geder to Benoyk, and made the prisoners a-light be-fore the\npaleis, and after lete sette hem in prison as the kynge Arthur\nhadde comaunded, and after thei hem vn-armed and duelled\nther in ioye and in feste.  And now shull we returne and speke\nof the lorde of the marasse and of his dou hter. A-noon with-ynne xv dayes after the kynge Ban, and the\nkynge Bohors, and Merlin were departed from the castell\nof the marasse, where thei hadde ley in ioye and feste, a riche\nman of the contrey com to the castell on a nyght; and the\nlorde of the castell, that was a worthy knyght and a wise, made\nhym grete chere, and in reuerence of hym made his doughter\nto serue of the cuppe as she that was full wise and wele lerned;\nand the knyght that ther-in was herberowed be-helde the\ndamesell that he liked right wele, and requered her of hir fader,\nand seide he wolde hir haue to his wif yef it hym liked, and\nthe fader hym thonked of the honour that he hym profered,\nand was ther-of full gladde, for he was the highest lorde of that\ncontrey, and seide he wolde speke ther-of to his doughter, and\nthan yeve hym ansuere; whan thei hadde soped, thei yede to\nreste, and on the morowe thei a-rise erly, and agrauadain\na-resoned his doughter of that the knyght hym requered, that\nwas so myghty a lorde, that by hym myght alle his frendes be\na-vaunced and worshiped; and whan the damesell this herde\nshe ansuerde hir fader debonerly, and seide, \"Sir, it is not yet\ntyme for me to be maried, for I am yonge, and ther-fore I\nbe-seche yow speketh not ther-of, but suffre me a-bide yef it\nplese yow.\"  \"Ffeire doughter,\" quod he, \"to leve spekinge\nherof I se no profite; ye ought to haue grete ioye in youre\nherte, for that so high a lorde deyneth to aske yow in mariage;\nffor ye be a woman but of lowe lynage a-gein hym, and\nther-for I pray yow and comaunde to do my will.\"  \"Sir,\" quod\nshe, \"ye may well yet suffre a-while, for be the feith that I owe\nto yow that be my fader, I am not yet in will to be maried.\"\n\"How so, feire daughter,\" quod he, \"will ye than refuse my\nplesier and my volunte.\"  \"Sir,\" quod she, \"I knowe well\nyoure will is not for to haue me I-loste.\"  \"I-loste,\" seide he,\n\"nay, but I-wonne to grete honour.\"  \"Nay, sir,\" quod she,\n\"but I-loste; for I sholde neuer haue ioye at myn herte, yef\nI were maried to eny other than to hym that I haue my-self\npromysed and graunted, and yet I knowe well that I shall\nneuer hym haue, but I shall holde me to hym that he hath me lefte, and he is of higher astate and feirer knight than is this.\"\n\"Doughter,\" seide he, \"of whom speke ye; tell me more clerly\nyoure thought and soche thinge I may of yow heren, that I\nshall put this thinge in respite.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the damesell,\n\"I shall yow telle, seth that ye will it knowe, and I shall of\nno worde make yow lesynge.\"  Than she tolde hym all in\nordore how it was hir be-falle be-twene hir and the kynge Ban\nof Benoyk, and how she was by hym with childe; \"\nand he\ntolde me that I sholde haue a sone by whom all my lynage\nshall be a-vaunced; wher-fore I praye yow be not a-boute to\nmarye me to noon other but to the kynge, ffor be the feith that\nI owe to god and to yow, I shall neuer haue other but hym.\" Whan the fader vndirstode his doughter, he was pensif\nand wroth, but chere ne semblaunt durste he noon\nmake, and ansuerde soberly, \"Doughter, seth it is thus, I moste\nit suffre, and therfore disconfort yow no-thinge, and I shall go\nspeke with this lorde, and telle hym youre will and nothinge\nmyn;\" and than he com to the knyght that was in doynge on\nhis spores, and salued hym curteysly, and seide, \"Sir, yef it\nplese yow to suffre this two yere, I will do youre volunte;\"\nand that he seide, for he knewe well he wolde it not graunte\nthat respite; whan the knyght this vndirstode, he ansuerde\nther-to no worde, but lepe to horse, he and his men, and\ndeparted with-oute leve takinge, and swor that seth he myght\nhir not haue with love he wolde hir haue be force, and after\nhym sholde haue hir who that wolde; and in this maner he\ndeparted and com in to his contrey and somowned his men, till\nhe hadde wele viij C knyghtes, and squyres, and yomen, and\nmany other sowdiours, and com with an hoste be-fore the\nCastell des Maras, and pight his teintes by the pyne tre nygh\nthe cauchie, and swor his oth that neuer sholde he departe thens\ntill he hadde hir to his wif; and whan the lorde des Maras\nsaugh hym-self be-seged, he was full of hevynesse, not for no\ndrede to be taken by strengthe, ne famyn myght thei not lightly\nfor all the reme myght hym not take, for I-nough he hadde of\nvitaile, for v yere that neuer hym neded to com oute at the yate; and he hadde ther-ynne xlij knyghtes that were bolde\nand hardy in armes, ffor the lorde des Mares was a noble\nknyght; and thus thei were be-fore the Castell viij dayes that\nneuer was caste ne shotte, and the ix the. day, a-boute the hour\nof prime, be-fill that a knyght of the hoste that was cleped\nMaudras com to the horn that ther henge, and sette it to his\nmouthe, and blewe thries with grete myght, so that the lorde\nof the castell it herde clerly; and than a-noon he armed hym\nrichely, and lepte vpon a stede with shelde be-fore his breste\nand a spere in hande, and the yate was hym opened, and he\nrode oute a grete raundon all the cauchie towarde the hoste,\nand cried with high voice whiche was he that was so hardy\nto blowen his horne with-oute his leve, and in euell tyme hadde\nhe it be-gonne, yef in hym were so moche hardynesse with\nhym to Iuste, and Maudras seide that for noon other cause was it\ndo, \"and I shall Iuste be soche couenaunt that he that falleth\nshall yelde hym-self taken prisoner with-oute more doynge.\"\n\"And I it graunte,\" seide Agrauadain, \"yef youre lorde will\nassent that I haue of hym no doute ne encombraunce ne of noon\nsaf only of yow.\"  \"In feith,\" quod he, \"ye shull haue no\ndoute of noon other seth ye be come so fer.\"  Than Agrauadain\ncom down of the cauchie, and he a Maudras ronne to-geder;\nand the knyghtes were renged rounde a-boute to be-holde the\nIustinge, and the two knyghtes mette with so grete raundon,\nthat the sheldes perced, Maudras brake his spere, and\nAgrauadain shof so sore, that he bar hym to grounde so rudely, that\nhe brake his lifte arme be-twene the hande and the\nelbowe.  Than he straught oute his hand and hente the horse by the\nreyne, and sette hym on the cauchie; and than he seide to\nMaudras that he sholde hym sewe and holde his couenaunt,\nand than he rode forth towarde the Castell, and drof Maudras\nhorse hym be-fore, and entred in at the yate where he was\nresceyved with ioye; and leriador and his knyghtes com to\nMaudras, and fonde hym on swowne, and thei wende he hadde\nbe deed.  And in a while after he yaf a grete sigh, and opened\nhis iyen, and comaunded that oon sholde bringe hym to the castell to a-quyte hym of his oth.  Than leriador lete make a\nbeere of smale bowes on horsbak, and leide hym ther-ynne,\nand couered with a riche cloth of silke and henge this litter\nbe-twene two horse, and sente hym to the castell.  And\nAgrauadain hym resceived, and lete put hym in a feire chambre\nwhere is arme was well dight with salues and\noynementes.  And thei that brought hym thider returned a-gein, and fonde\nleriador sori and wroth, and so were all the other. On the morowe com a-nother knyght, and blewe the horne;\nand agrauadain com and Iusted with hym, and smote\nhym down, and toke his feith to be prisoner, and wente with\nhym to the castell, and thus Agrauadain wan xj, and therfore\nwas the lorde sory and angry; and the xij the. day he blewe the\nhorne hym-self; and whan Agrauadain was come as he was\nwonte to do, than seide Leriador that at this Iustinge sholde be\nfynysshed the werre, and the sege departe; ffor yef Agrauadain\nhym conquered, he wolde returne a-gein in to his contrey with\nall his hoste.  Ne neuer he ne noon of his sholde touche\nnothinge of his, \"and yef I yow conquere ye shull me yeve youre\ndoughter to be my wif, for I aske yow no more.\"  This was\ngraunted on bothe parties.  And than wente the two knyghtes\nto-geder, and mette with grete raundon on the sheldes a-bove\nthe bokeles that thei perced and rente the hauberkes, that the\nspere poyntes passed be the sides, so that the blode spronge oute\nof bothe parties; than thei hurteled so harde with bodies and\nsheldes, that eche bar other to grounde, bothe horse and man,\nthat bothe were sore astonyed, and lay longe while at the erthe;\nbut bothe thei lept vpon foot, and drough theire suerdes and\nsmote grete strokes at discouert, and made grete woundes and\nmerveilouse, and bothe waxen feble for the blode that thei\nbledde; but in the ende leriador be-hoved to come to mercy,\nand departed from the sege, and wente hom to his contrie; and\nAgrauadain returned to his castell, and leide salue to his\nwoundes, and sente the prisoners in to her contreyes; and he\na-bode gladde and myrye till his doughter was delyuered of a\nsone, that after was of grete renoun in the reame of logres, and in many other contreyes, and was cleped by his right name\nEstor; and of hym hadde Agrauadain grete ioye, and made hym\nbe norisshed in his chambre, and delyuered hym thre norices;\nand the damesell hir-self yaf hym sowke of hir owne mylke,\nffor ther was nothinge that she loved so moche, ffor he was so\nlike the kynge Ban as he hadde be portreyed.  But now shull\nwe cesse of hym a-while, and of his moder, and of Agrauadain,\nthat helde hym dere, and returne to speke of the kynge fflualis\nthat longe hath be stille. Now whan that Merlin was departed from the kynge fflualis,\nto whom he hadde tolde his a-vision; and the kynge\nfflualis a-bood sore dismayed of that Merlin hadde seide, and\nin short tyme after be-fill like as he hadde tolde, for he saugh\nhis children in the temple of diane I-slayn, and the temple\ncaste down and dispoiled, and his londe distroied, and his paleys\nbrente, and hym-self taken and his wif; but thei that hym\ntoke ne slough hym not, but shewed hem the poyntes of the\ncristin feith, and made hem so to vndirstonde fro day to day,\nthat thei were baptised and waisshe fro the filthe of synne of\nmysbeleve, and was cleped be the same name that he hadde\nbe-fore, and that was fflualis; but the ladies name was chaunged,\nand cleped hir misiane, and hir name was be-fore cleped\nLumble; and after were thei longe to-geder till thei hadde\nfoure doughtres, that after hadde foure princes that were\ncristin, and were full good peple and trewe, and hadde many\nchildren; ffor the elthest hadde x sones, that were alle good\nknyghtes by the kynge fflualis lif, and viij doughteres; and the\nseconde hadde xij sones and thre doughtres; and the thridde\nvj sones and xij doughtres; and the fourthe xv sones and a\ndoughter, and were alle maryed, and the sones knyghtes while\nthe kynge was lyvinge, and the quene Misiane, that ther-of\nhadde grete ioye and gladnesse, and thonked our lorde.  Whan\nthe kynge fflualis and the foure princes saugh that thei hadde\nliiij children that were alle bretheren and cosins germain, thei\nmade grete ioye, and seide that oure lorde hadde hem sent to\navaunce the cristin lawe, and seide thei sholde neuer cesse till thei hadde made alle paynyms cristin, and obbeye the lawes of\ngod and holy cherche. Than thei somowned and assembled all her power, and ronne\nthourgh paynym londes, and toke townes, and slough\nmany a paynym, and conquered the londes of the straunge\ncontreyes, and passed in to Galys, and in to Spayne, so that\nnothinge myght a-gein hem endure, till that the kynge fflualis\nwas deed in spayne, and ther-fore were the foure princes full\ndolent and the nevewes, and was biried in a Cite that tho was\ncleped Nadres; and than thei repeired towarde the parties of\nIeshuralem, and set the londes in her handes, and after departed\nby diuerse londes, and hem conquered and toke the honours,\nthat oon hilde Costantynnoble; and that other greece, where he\nhadde foure regiouns; and the thridde hilde barbarie; and the\nfourthe Cipre; and some come in to the reame of logres for to\nserve the kynge Arthur, for the grete renoome that of hym was\nthourgh the worlde, and with hem com foure knightes that\nwere bolde and hardy in armes, but litill tyme thei lyved, and\nthat was grete harme to all cristin peple, ffor thei were noble\nand trewe, and the tweyne were deed in a bateile that launcelot\nmade a-gein the kynge Claudas; and the thridde in a bateile\nthat the kynge Arthur made a-gein Mordred as shall be rehersed\nhere-after.  But now shull we returne to speke of the kynge\nArthur. In this partie, seith the storie, that whan the kynge\nArthur and his companye had disconfited the romayns,\nand the kynge hadde slayn the catte, thei returned and rode\ntill thei com to the castell that the kynge hadde fortefied vpon\nthe river of Aube, and were there viij dayes; and after thei\ndeparted and rode forth till thei com to Benoyk, ffor it was\ntolde hem that there were the prisoners, and Pharien and\nCleodalis hem resceyved with grete ioye; and after thei tolden\nhow thei hadde rescowed theire peple, and the Prisoners and\nall thinge as it was fallen, and how thei of the castell wolde haue taken hem be force.  \"Be my feith,\" seide the kynge,\n\"in euell tyme thei it be-gonne, for dere shall it be bought.\"\nThan the kynge cleped sir Gawein, and bad hym go to the\ncastell that was cleped the marche, and throwe it down to the\ngrounde, so that thei of other contreyes be not so hardy eny\nmore to encombre me ne noon of myn, and sir Gawein made\nx Ml lepe to horse, and rode forth till thei com to the castell\na-boute mydnyght, and enbusshed hem in a wode that was v\nbowe draught ffrom the castell, and ther thei a-bide till on the\nmorowe that thei of the castell sette oute theire beestes, and\na-noon as it was oute sir Gawein sent oute xiiij knyghtes that\npassed the pray, and drough toward the yate, and with hem\nv arblastres for to shete vp to the barbycans, and to kepe the\nyate till he were come, and thei dide as Gawein hem\ncomaunded; and it was yet so erly that un-ethe oon myght knowe\na-nother, and thei hem dressed toward the yate as soone as the\npray was oute; whan sir Gawein sye the praye come nygh he\nwiste well that the other were be-fore; and he sente be-yonde\nhem that drof the praye xx knyghtes; and whan thei hem\nsaugh thei lefte the praye and wolde haue turned a-gein to the\nyate, but the knyghtes and the arblastres that sir Gawein had\nsente diffended hem the entre till that Gawein was comen, and\nsmyten in at the yate moo than vj C .  Than was ther grete crie\nand noyse, and thei that were in the tour lete falle the\nportcolys, and smote a-sonder two horse be the croupe and the\nknyghtes fill with-ynne, with-oute more harme; and than a-ros\nthe noyse and the crye thourgh the contrey, and thei ronne\nto the barbicans and caste stones and caliouns; and the v\narblastres shote vpwarde, and the other be-gonne to hewe the\nyates a-sonder, and thei that were with-oute entred in; and\nthei that were of the castell dide hem yelde to the volunte of\nsir Gawein, and he made hem be ledde to Benoyk; and than\nhe lete beete down the walles and the bretesches, and after\nreturned to the kynge Arthur that ther-of was gladde and ioyfull; and the kynge made the prisoners to swere that thei\nsholde neuer be a-gein the kynge Ban, ne the kynge Bohors; and\nso made he hem swere that were of Rome that thei sholde neuer\nbe a-gein the reame of logres; and whan thei were thus sworn,\nhe sente hem a-gein in to theire contrey, and soiourned all that\nday, and on the morowe with the kynge Ban with grete ioye\nand grete feeste.  With that com a messagere to the kynge\nArthur that brought tidinges that the kynge leodogan of\nCarmelide was deed, and that was the cause he departed so soone\nfro the kynge Ban.  On the morowe the kynge Arthur departed\nfro the two kynges that were brethern, and after that tyme he\nsaugh hem neuer more; and that was grete scade that thei\nsholde die so soone, as the storie shall declare whan tyme cometh. Whan the kynge Arthur was departed fro the two kynges\nthat were brethern, that so moche honour hadde hym\ndon, he traueiled so by his iourneyes that he com to the see\nand entred in to shippes, and passed ouer and landed at the\nport of Dover, and lepe on their horse and ride forth to logres,\nand ther thei fonde the Quene Gonnore, that hem resceived with\ngrete ioye, and tolde how hir fader was passed oute of this\nworlde, and he hir counforted in the beste wise he myght; and\nafter the kynge departed his peple and thei yode hom in to\ntheire contreyes, and the kynge Arthur a-boode at logres, and\nsir Gawein and the knyghtes of the rounde table, and Merlin\nsoiourned ther longe tyme.  Than he hadde grete talent for to\nse Blase his maister, for to telle hym of all that was be-fallen\nseth he fro hym departed; and fro thens he wolde go to Nimiane\nhis love, for the terme drough faste on that was sette; and he\nwente to the kynge and seide that hym be-hoved to go; and\nthe kynge and the quene prayed hym right entierly soone for\nto come a-gein, for he dide hem grete solas and counfort of his\ncompanye, ffor the kynge hym loved feithfully; for in many\na nede he hadde hym socoured and\n holpen, ffor by hym and by\nhis counseile was he kynge; and he seide to hym right tenderly,\n\"Dere frende Merlin, seth ye will go, I dar yow not with-holde\na-gein youre wille a volunte; but I shall neuer be in hertes ese till that I may se yow, and therefore I pray you for the\nlove of oure lorde haste you soone to come a-gein.\"  \"Sir,\"\nseide Merlin, \"this is the laste time, and ther-fore to god I you\ncomaunde.\"  Whan the kynge herde how he seide it was the\nlaste tyme that he sholde hym se, he was sore a-baisshed; and\nMerlin departed with-oute moo wordes sore wepinge, and\ntrauailed till he come to Blase his maister, that grete chere hym\nmade, and asked how he hadde sped sethen, and he seide wele;\nand than he tolde him alle thinges as thei were be-falle of the\nkynge Arthur and of the Geaunte that he hadde slayn; and of\nthe bateile of the Romains; and how he hadde slain the cat;\nand tolde hym also of the litill duerfe how the damesell hadde\nhym brought to court, and how the kynge hadde made hym\nknyght.  \"But thus moche,\" seide Merlin, \"I shall telle yow,\nhe is a grete gentilman, and is no duerf by nature, but thus hath\na damesell hym myshapen whan he was xiij yere of age, for\nthat he wolde not graunte hir his love, and he was than the\nfeirest creature of the worlde; and for the sorowe that the\ndamesell hadde a-raied she hym in soche wise that now is the\nlothliest creature and of moste dispite; and fro hens ix wikes\nshall cesse the terme that the damesell sette, and shall come in\nto the age that he ought for to be, for at that day shall he be\nxxij yere olde.\"  Whan Merlin hadde all thinges rehersed,\nand Blase hadde hem alle writen oon after a-nother in ordre,\nand by his boke haue we the knowinge ther-of; and whan\nMerlin hadde be ther viij dayes he toke leve of Blase, and seide,\n\"This is the laste tyme that I shall speke with yow eny more,\nffor fro hens-forth I shall soiourne with my love, ne neuer\nshall I haue power hir for to leve ne to come ne go.\" Whan Blase vndirstode Merlin, he was full of sorowe, and\nseide, \"Dere frende, seth it is so that ye may not\ndeparte cometh not ther.\"  \"Me be-houeth for to go,\" qoud\nMerlin, \"for so haue I made hir couenaunt, and also I am so\nsupprised with hir love, that I may me not with-drawen; and\nI haue her taught and lerned all the witte and connynge that\nshe can, and yet shall she lerne more, for I may not hir with-sein ne it disturue.\" Than departed Merlin from Blase, and\nin litill space com to his love, that grete ioye of hym made\nand he of hir, and dwelled to-geder longe tyme; and euer she\nenquered of his craftes, and he hir taught and lerned so moche\nthat after he was holden a fooll and yet is, and she hem well\nvndirstode and put hem in writinge, as she that was well expert\nin the vij artes.  Whan that he hadde hir taught all that she\ncowde aske, she be-thought hir how she myght hym with-holde\nfor euer more; than be-gan she to glose Merlin more than euer\nshe hadde do euer be-forn, and seide, \"Sir, yet can I not oon\nthinge that I wolde fain lerne, and ther-fore I pray you that\nye wolde me enforme;\" and Merlin that well knewe her entent,\nseid, \"Madame, what thinge is that?\"  \"Sir,\" qoud she, \"I\nwolde fain lerne how I myght oon shet in a tour with-outen\nwalles, or with-oute eny closure be enchauntement, so that\nneuer he sholden go oute with-outen my licence;\" and whan\nMerlin it herde he bowed down the heed and be-gan to sigh,\nand she it a-parceived, she asked whi he sighed.  \"Madame,\"\nseide Merlin, \"I shall telle yow; I knowe well what ye thinke,\nand that ye will me with-holde, and I am so supprised with\nlove that me be-houeth to do youre plesier;\" and than she caste\nhir armes a-boute his nekke and hym kiste, and seide, \"that\nwele he ought to be hirs seth that she was all his; ye knowe\nwele that the grete love that I haue to you hath made me\nforsake alle other for to haue yow in myn armes nyght and\nday, and ye be my thought and my desire, for with-oute yow\nhaue I neither ioye ne welthe.  In you haue I sette all my\nhope, and I a-bide noon other ioye but of yow, and seth that\nI love you, and also ye love me, is not right than that ye do\nmy volunte and I yours.\"  \"Certes, yesse,\" seide Merlin, \"now\nsey than what ye will.\"  \"I will,\" qoud she, \"ye teche me\na place feire and couenable, that I myght enclose by art in soche wise that neuer myght be vn-don, and we shull be\nther, ye and I in ioye and disporte whan that yow\nliketh.\"  \"Madame,\" seide Merlin, \"that shall I well do.\"  \"Sir,\"\nqoud she, \"I will not that ye it make, but lerne it to me that I may it do, and I shall make it than more at my\nvolunte.\"  \"Well,\" seide Merlin, \"I will do youre plesire.\"  Than he\nbe-gan to devise the crafte vnto hir, and she it wrote all that\nhe seide; and whan hadde alle devised, the damesell hadde\ngrete ioye in herte, and he hir loved more and more, and she\nshewed hym feirer chere than be-forn; and so thei soiourned\nto-geder longe tyme, till it fill on a day that thei wente thourgh\nthe foreste hande in hande, devisinge and disportinge, and this\nwas in the foreste of brochelonde, and fonde a bussh that was\nfeire and high of white hawthorne full of floures, and ther thei\nsatte in the shadowe; and Merlin leide his heed in the damesels\nlappe, and she be-gan to taste softly till he fill on slepe; and\nwhan she felt that he was on slepe she a-roos softly, and made a\ncerne with hir wymple all a-boute the bussh and all a-boute Merlin,\nand be-gan hir enchauntementz soche as Merlin hadde hir taught,\nand made the cerne ix tymes, and ix tymes hir\nenchauntementes; and after that she wente and satte down by hym and\nleide his heed in hir lappe, and hilde hym ther till he dide\na-wake; and than he loked a-boute hym, and hym semed he\nwas in the feirest tour of the worlde, and the moste stronge,\nand fonde hym leide in the feirest place that euer he lay be-forn;\nand than he seide to the damesell, \"Lady, thou hast me\ndisceived, but yef ye will a-bide with me, for noon but ye may\nvn-do this enchauntementes; and she seide, \"Feire swete\nfrende, I shall often tymes go oute, and ye shull haue me in\nyoure armes, and I yow; and fro hens-forth shull ye do alle youre\nplesier;\" and she hym hilde wele couenaunt, ffor fewe hours\nther were of the nyght ne of the day but she was with\nhym.  Ne neuer after com Merlin oute of that fortresse that she hadde\nhym in sette; but she wente in and oute whan she wolde.  But\nnow moste we reste a-while of Merlin and his love, and\nspeke of the kynge Arthur. The same hour that Merlin was departed fro the kynge\nArthur, and that he hadde seide how it was the laste\ntyme that he sholde hym se; the kynge a-boode sore a-baisshed\nand full pensif of that worde, and in soche maner he a-boode after Merlin vij wikes and more; but whan he saugh that he\ncom nought he was full pensif and full of hevynesse, aud on a\nday sir Gawein asked what hym eiled.  \"Certes nevew,\" seide\nthe kynge, \"I thinke on that I trowe I haue loste Merlin, and\nthat he will neuer more come to me, ffor now hath he a-biden\nlenger than he was wonte, and gretly I am dismayed of the\nworde that he seide whan he fro me departed, ffor he seide this\nis the last tyme, therfore I am in doute that he sey soth, ffor\nhe ne made neuer lesinge of nothinge that he seide, ffor so\nhelpe me god I hadde leuer lese the Cite of logres than hym,\nand ther-fore fain wolde I wite yef eny myght hym finde fer\nor nygh, and ther-fore I pray you as derely as ye me love that\nye hym seche till ye knowe the verite.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Gawein,\n\"I am all redy to do youre volunte, and a-noon ye shull se\nme meve fordwarde, and I suere to you be the oth that I made\nto you whan ye made me knyght, that I shall seche hym a\nyere and a day, but with-ynne that space I may knowe trewe\ntidinges.\"  In this same wise swor sir Ewein, and Segramor,\nand Agrauain, and Geheret, and Gaheries, and xxv of her\nfelowes, and that oon was Doo of Cardoell, and Sacren of the\nstreite Marche, and Taulus le rous, and Blioc de Cassell, and\nCaues de lille, and Amadas de la Crespe, and placidas li gais,\nand laudalus de la playne, and Aiglins des vaus, and Clealis\nlorfenyns, and Grires de lamball, and kehedins li bens, and\nCaros de la broche, and Segurades de la forest perilouse, and\nPurades de Carmelide, and Carmeduk the blake; alle these swor\nthe same oth with sir Gawein, and departed fro the Cite of\nlogres alle to-geder by the volunte of kynge Arthur, and\nwente alle in the quest for Merlin; and whan thei were oute\nof the Cite thei departed alle at a crosse that thei fonde at\nthe entre of a foreste where ther mette thre weyes, and ther\nthei departed in thre parties.  But of hem shull we reste\na-while, and speke of the damesell that ledde a-wey the duerf\nknyght. Whan kynge Arthur hadde a-dubbed the duerf by the\npreier and request of the damesell, and she hadde hym ledde as ye haue herde gladde and ioyfull, and returned to hir\ncontrey, and rode so the firste day till it was nygh the nyght;\nand than thei com oute of the foreste and entred in to a feire\nlaunde that was grete and large; and than the damesell loked\nbe-fore hir and saugh comynge a knyght armed vpon a stede,\nand she shewde hym the duerf; and he ansuerde, \"Damesell,\ndismaye yow nought but ride forth boldly, for ye shull haue\nno drede of hym.\"  \"Sir, he will me bere a-wey be force, and\nhe cometh hider for noon other cause;\" and the duerf ansuerde\na-gein, \"Damesell, ride forth suerly, and beth not a-ferde;\" and\nthe knyght hym ascried with lowde voys, \"Welcome be my\ndamesell and my love, ffor now haue I founde that I haue longe\nsought.\"  And the duerf that well hym vndirstode, seide\ndebonerly, \"Sir, be not to hasty, for ye may desire hir to moche at\nthe be-gynnynge, ffor yet ye haue hir not in youre bailly,\nwherfore ye sholde make so grete ioye.\"  \"I owe well to make\nioye,\" quod the knyght; \"for I am of hir sure I-nough, ffor\nthough I haue hir not, yet I shall right soone;\" and euer he\ncom on as faste as he myght ride; and whan the duerf saugh\nhym com so faste, he caste his spere in fewtre, and couered hym\nwith his shelde that nothinge apered saf the shelde only, and\nsmote the horse with the spores on bothe sides faste by the\nskirtes of his sadell, for his legges were so shorte, and the\nhorse hym bar with so grete raundon that it semed as he hadde\nflowen, and cried to the knyght that he sholde hym diffende;\nand he that was full fierce and prowde hadde shame to iuste\nwith so litill a wrecche, and lifte vp his spere, and seide, yef\ngod will, with soche a disfigure worme sholde he neuer Iuste,\nand hilde his spere vp-right, but neuertheles he couered hym\nwith his shelde; and the duerf hym smote so harde, that he\nperced shelde and hauberk, that the spere passed by the side\nand hurtled so harde with his shelde, and with the grete myght\nof his horse, that to grounde goth the knyght horse and man,\nand in the fallinge his sholdre spronge oute of ioynte, and the duerf rode ouer his body and hym all to-brosed, so that the\nknyght swowned for anguyssh that be felte; and whan the\nduerf that saugh, he cleped the damesell, and prayed hir to take\nhym down, and she toke hym in hir armes, and helped hym\ndown of his horse, and he drough his swerde and ran to the\nknyght and vn-laced his helme, and manaced hym to smyten\nof his deed, but he wolde hym yelde vtterly; and the knyght\nthat was hurt saugh the suerde that he hilde ouer his heed, and\nhadde drede of deth, and cride \"mercy,\" and put hym in his\nwille of all thinge.  \"Than,\" quod the duerf, \"shalt thow go,\nyelde the to the Prison of kynge Arthur, and sey hym that the\nlitill knyght that he dubbed hath sent the to be his prisoner,\nand that thou shalt put the only in his mercy;\" and the knyght\nensured hym his feith to do in this maner.  Than he badde\nhym go to his horse, and he seide he hadde ther-to no power,\nfor his sholdre bon was oute of Ioynte; \"but here I moste\na-bide,\" quod he, \"till I fynde oon that me may beren, but\nye shull go take youre horse and ride to the ende of this launde\nin a valey where ye shull finde a place of myn, ffor it is tyme\nfor you to herberowe, and a-bide ye ther stille, and sende some\nof my men that may bere me thider, and haue ye no doute of\nnothinge.\"  And the duerf hym graunted, and com towarde\nthe Damesell that hilde his stede, and she stouped ouer the\nnekke of hir palfrey, and caught hym by the armes, and drough\nhym vp with grete peyne till that he myght nyghe his sadell;\nand than turned toward the knyghtes recete, and a-geins hem\ncom vj squyres that were ther-ynne, and toke hym down, and\nthe damesell and hym vn-armed, and dide hym on a mantell\nfull riche, and the duerf hem seide how hir lorde was hurt,\nand thei toke a biere and brought hym a-gein to his recete,\nand hym vn-armed, and sente after leches, and dight hym softly\nin the beste wise thei cowden; and after thei asked who hadde\nhym thus araied; and he sede a knyght that he nothinge knewe,\nne he durste not sey for shame that the duerf hadde it don;\nand than he made his hoste the beste chere that he myght, and\nmade hem richely be serued at ese in a feire chambre where-ynne were two riche beddes, and ther thei slepte till on the\nmorowe that thei a-rise and made hem redy, and the maiden\narmed hir duerf, for she hym loved feithfully, and wolde not\nsuffre noon to sette on hym eny hande but hir-self; and whan\nshe hadde hym armed, and a-pareiled saf only of his helme, she\ntoke hym by the hande and ledde hym in to a chambre ther the\nlorde of the place lay, and bad hym good morowe; and he hem\nsalued right curteisly, and thei be-taught hym to god, and\nthanked hym of the honour that he hadde hem don.  Than\nwente thei oute of the chambre, and the mayden laced on his\nhelme, and helped hym on his horse, and delyuered hym his\nspere and his shelde; and than the squyres brought the mayden\nhir palfrey, and sette hir ther-on; than thei departed fro thens\nand toke the wey toward Eastrangore; and the knyght that was\nhurt thought to a-quyte hym of his feith, and lete make an\nhorse litere full riche, and hadde with-ynne a feire bedde, and\nthe liter couered with a riche cloth of silke, and the knyght\nwas leide with-ynne; and the liter leide vpon two palfreyes\nsofte amblinge, and toke the wey streight to Cardoell in walis\nwhere the kynge and the quene soiourned with grete companye of peple; and the kynge satte at dyner in the halle, and the\nknyght made hym to be born in to the halle be-fore the kynge,\nand seide, \"Sir kynge, for to a-quyte me my feith and my\ngraunte I am I-come to put me in thi prison, and in thy\nmercy, as he that is full sore a-shamed of the lothlyest creature\nof this worlde, that by his armes me hath conquered;\" and\nwhan he hadde seide thus, he badde his squyers bere hym thens;\nand than seide the kynge, \"Sir knyght, what is this, thou\nseidest thou were come to my prison and my mercy.\"  \"Ye\nsir,\" seide the knyght.  \"Than I requyre,\" quod the kynge,\n\"that ye as a prisoner you mayntene, and that ye telle me in\nwhos be-halue ye yelde yow take, and how that ye were\nconquered.\"  \"Sir,\" seide the knyght, \"I se well I moste telle\nmy grete shame and myn annoye, and I shall telle it you seth\nI am come ther-to for to parforme youre will and my feith for\nto a-quiten.  This is the trouthe that I haue loved a damesell of grete bewte, and kynges doughter, and yef ye will knowe\nher name it is the feire beaune the doughter of knyge Clamedien\nthat is riche and puyssaunt, but neuer myght I bringe hir\ntherto nother for prayer, ne for love, ne for chiualrie, that I\nmyght do for hir, she ne wolde neuer graunte me hir love, and\nI wolde gladly haue hadde hir to my wif, and hir fader wolde\nit well also, and ther-of was gladde, for I am kynges sone and\nquenes, but she euer for-soke me for the moste vile and lothsom\ncreature of the worlde, and fill me so that I rode this other\nday thourgh a launde all alone I-armed, and mette my\ndamesell that repeired from youre contre, and hir dide condite the\nduerf knyght to whom she is love; and whan I saugh hir\ncome with so small condite I was right gladde, and thanked\ngod that thider hir hadde sente, and I wende to haue hir ledde\nawey with-oute more with-seyinge.  But the duerf seide that\nI come to sone, and that it was folye for me so sore to haste,\nfor it sholde go all othere wise than I wende, ffor I trowed to\nhaue my desire with-oute diffence; and ther-fore I seide my\nvolunte was well a-complisshed, and I rode faste a-gein the\ndamesell hir to haue taken, and haue ledde hir with me to a\nplace of myne that was not fer thens; and whan the duerf\nknyght saugh me so be-fore he leide his spere in fewtre, and\nI wolde no Iuste with hym with my spere, for me thought\nit shame and dispite to Iuste with soche a creature, and\nther-fore I wolde not smyte, and he bar me so rudely to grounde,\nthat in the fall my lifte sholdre yede oute of Ioynte that I\nswowned for anguyssh; and he vn-laced myn helme and wolde\nhaue smyten of myn heed, but yef I hadde hym assured to\nyelde me to youre prison, and ther-fore I do me in youre grace.\"\n\"Trewly, frende,\" seide the kynge, \"in good prison hath he\nyou sette that to me hath you sente, ffor I clayme yow quyte;\nbut ye shall telle me youre name.\"  \"Sir,\" quod he, \"my\nname is Tradilyuaunt, and am the kynges godsone of North\nwalis, that for grete cherite yaf me his name;\" with that his\nsquyres toke hym vp, and bar hym oute of the paleise, and\nleyde hym on two palfreyes, and ledde hym a-gein in to his contrei; and the kynge Arthur and his barouns spake I-nough\nof the duerf, and of the damesell, and seide it were grete ioye\nyef the duerf myght come a-gein in to his bewte; and preyse\nthe damesell that in no myschef wolde forsake hir love for no\nlothlynesse.  But now at thys tyme cesseth of hem, and\nreturneth to speke of Segramor that wente in to the quest of\nMerlin, and with hym ix knyghtes full profitable bolde and\nhardy. Whan Segramor was departed fro sir Gawein, he ledde\nwith hym ix of his felowes of the same enquest, and\nrode till the sonne was go to reste; and than of a-uenture thei\nloked at the comynge of the foreste at the issue of a roche, and\nsaugh a celle where-ynne woned an hermyte, and that wey thei\nturned ther for to be herberowed, and thei knokked at the yate,\nand the hermyte it opened a-noon and herberowed hem that\nnyght as wele as he cowde; and on the morowe erly he seide\nmasse; and than thei departed fro thens, and com to the\nentringe of a foreste, and than seide Segramor to his felowes\nthat thei sholde departe thourgh the foreste, and so thei diden;\nand so that oon wente here and a-nother there, as a-uenture hem\nledde, and in that quest be-fill many feire a-uentures wher-of\nthis storie maketh no mencion, but so thei yede vp and down by\ndiuerse contrees that thei performed that enquest that neuer\ncowde thei lerne no tidinges of that thei were meved for to\nseche; and at the yeres ende thei com a-gein and tolde theire\na-uentures, and some ther were that tolde more theire shame\nthan theire honoure, but trouthe moste thei sey by theire oth\nthat thei hadden sworn; and in tho dayes gentilmen were so\ntrewe, that thei wolde rather lese theire lif than be for-sworn;\nand now shull we speke of Ewein. Whan Ewein and his felowes were departed fro Gawein,\nhe rode till he com to the issue of a foreste, and ther\nthei mette a damesell that rode vpon a mule, and made the moste\nsorowe of the worlde, and rente hir heer, and cried lowde,\n\"Alas, where shall I be-come whan I haue loste hym that I\nhaue loved so wele, and he me.  And for the love of me hath he loste the grete bewte that was in hym;\" and whan sir\nEwein this herde, he hadde ther-of grete pite, and com hir\na-geins and asked why she made soche sorowe; and she\nansuerde, \"Gentill knyght, haue pite of me and of my love, that\nv knyghtes sle in this valey be-nethe this hill.\"  \"Who is\nyoure love, damesell,\" quod sir Ewein.  \"Sir,\" qoud she, \"it\nis Audain the duerf, the sone of kynge Brangore.\"  \"Now\nlet be youre doell,\" seide sir Ewein, \"for by the feith that I\nowe to you he shall noon harme haue, yef I may come be-tyme.\"\n\"Sir, gramercy,\" seide the damesell; \"but ye moste you\nhasten.\"  Than sir Ewein rode that wey as the maiden hym\ntaught as faste as his horse myght renne; and the damesell hym\nsewed as moche as she myght, for her mule wente werily, and\nsir Ewein hath so riden that he saugh the duerf that vigerously\nfaught with two knyghtes, and saugh thre ly in myddell of the\nfeilde that hadde no power to a-rise; ffor that oon was smyte\nwith a spere thourgh the sholdre, that al was disseuered fro the\nbody, and that other was smyte with a suerde down to the teth;\nand the other tweyne were full feble, and hadde grete doute of\ntheire deth, for the duerf sought on hem vigerously; and whan\nsir Ewein saugh hym thus contene, he shewed to his felowes,\nand seide that it was grete harme of the duerf that was so\nmysshapen, \"for he is bolde and hardy, and of grete herte.\"\n\"Certes, sir,\" seide oon of his companye, \"neuer no man of\nhis stature dide soche prowesse, but for goddes sake departe\nhem that thei no myscheve, for that were pite, yef hym\nmyshappe.\" \"Ye sey trouthe,\" quod sir Ewein; and than he\npriked thider.  But er he com he hadde leyde oon to grounde,\nand rode ouer his body thre tymes, that nygh he hadde hym\nslayn; whan the fifte saugh he was a-lone, he hadde drede\nof hym-self, and be-gan to blenche, and wolde haue fledde, and\nwith-oute faile he was wounded in thre places right depe; but\nthe duerf that richely was horsed hilde hym so straite, and so\nhym hasted, that deed he hadde I-be ne hadde sir Ewein come\nthe soner, and seide, \"Feire, sir, ne do no more, but lete hym\nbe for curtesie, for we se well how it is, and I-nough haue ye don;\" and whan the duerf herde how he hym required so\ncurteisly, he ansuerde as he that was curteise and\ndeboneir.  \"Sir, pleseth it you that I cesse thus.\"  \"Ye,\" seide Ewein,\n\"and ther-of I thanke you, for we se well how it is.\"  \"And\nI shall do youre request,\" seide the duerf, \"for ye seme well\nto be a worthy man;\" with that com the knyght that had\nfoughten with the duerf to sir Ewein, and seide, \"Sir, gramercy,\nfor ye haue saued me fro deth by youre comynge, and blissed\nbe that lorde that hider you hath brought.\"  Than he dide\nyelde his suerde to the duerf, and the duerf hit resceived; and\nin the same wise dide the tother that were lefte on lyve, and\nhe hem sente in to the prison of kynge Arthur, and sir Ewein\nand his companye departed fro the duerf and fro the damesell,\nand spredde a-brode thourgh diuerse contrees, and sought Merlin\nvp and down, but neuer myght thei here of hym tidinges, and\nther-fore were thei sory and wroth, and repeired to court at the\nyeres ende, and eche of hem tolde his auenture that was hym\nbe-falle in his quest, but the kynge Arthur made all to be\nwriten.  But now cesseth of the kynge, and of alle the other\ncompanye, and returne to sir Gawein. Whan that sir Gawein was departed fro his felowes, he\nrode forth thourgh the foreste, he and v knyghtes of\nhis companye, and ther thei departed, and eche wente his wey,\nfor he wolde ride sooll by hym-self, and in this wise thei\ndeparted, so that eche of hem toke his wey; and sir Gawein rode\nso a-lone serchinge grete part of the londe, till it fill on a day\nthat he rode pensif and hevy, for that he myght not finde\nMerlin; and in this stody he entred in to a foreste, and he\nhadde riden a-boute two walsh myle ther com a damesell hym\na-gein that rode on the feirest palfrey of the worlde, and was\nall blak, and sadell and the stiropes were all of golde, and\nthe cloth of scarlet trailinge to the erthe, and the bridill of\ngolde, and she was clothed in white samyte, and hir kirchires\nof silke, and richely atired, and com ridinge be-fore sir Gawein as he was in this pensifnesse, that he dide her not salue; and\nwhan he was passed the Damesell she reyned hir bridill, and\nturned the heed of hir palfrey, and seide, \"Gawein, Gawein, hit is not trewe the renomee that renneth of the thourgh the\nreame of logres; ffor it is seide of the that thou art the best\nknyght of the worlde, and of that thei sey trouthe.  Also it is\nseide that thou art the gentilest and the most curteise knyght,\nbut in that faileth the renoon, for thou art the moste vileyn\nknyght that euer I mette in my lif, that in this forest so fer fro\npeple haste me I-met a-lone, and so grete felonye in the is roted,\nthat thow deynest not me ones to salue ne to speke a worde,\nand knowe thow verily thow shalt it repente of that thow hast\ndon, in so moche that thou shalt wissh thou haddest it not don\nfor all the reame of logres.\"  And whan sir Gawein vndirstode\nthe damesell, he was sore a-shamed, and turned a-gein hir his\nbridell of gringalet, and seide all shamefast as ye shull\nheren.  \"Damesell,\" quod sir Gawein, \"so helpe me god , I thought\nvpon a thinge that I go sechinge, and ther-fore I pray yow that\nye for-yeve it me that I haue mys-don.\"  \"So helpe me god,\"\nquod the damesell, \"rather shalt thou a-bye it full dere, ffor\nI-nough thou shalt haue of shame and lothlynesse, and ther-fore\nremembre a-nother tyme whan thou metest with eny lady or\ndamesell, that thou hir salue for curtesie.  But I sey not that\nit shall the euer endure, ne of that thou goist sechinge shalt\nthou finde noon in the reame of logres that the can telle no\ntidinge, but in the litill breteigne maist thou here som maner\ntidinges; and I will go now ther as I haue to don, and thou\nshalt go seche that thou art moved fore; and the firste man that\nthou metest with mote thou be like till thou se me eft-sones.\"\nThan departed sir Gawein and the damesell; but he hadde not\nriden fully half a walissh myle thourgh the foreste that he mette\nwith the duerf knyght; and the damesell that on the euen\nbe-fore were departed fro sir Ewein, and hedde sent the foure\nknyghtes in Arthurs prison, and it was on trinite sonday a-boute\nmydday, and than he remembred hym on the damesell that he\nhadde mette be-fore, and lefte his pensifnesse, and seide to the damesell, \"God yeve you good day and moche ioye of hir\ncompanye;\" and the damesell and the duerf hym ansuerde that\ngod yeve hym good a-uenture; and so thei past a litill a-sonder,\nsir Gawein on that oon part, and thei on that other; and whan\nthei were departed a litill thens the duerf knyght be-com a-gein\nin to his bewte as he hadde be at the first tyme, and was in\nthe age of xxij yere, right wele furnysshed and wonderly well\nshapen of large stature, and ther-fore hym be-hoved to do a-wey\nhis armes, for thei were to hym nothinge meete; and whan the\ndamesell saugh hir love come a-gein in to so grete bewte, she\nhadde so grete ioye that no tonge myght it telle, and caste hir\narmes a-boute his nekke, and hym kiste an hundred tymes, and\nride forth that oon by that other gladde and ioyfull in grete\nsolas, and thanked oure lorde of the honour that he hadde hem\ndon, and praied oure lorde to sende sir Gawein good a-uenture,\nthat hadde seide that god yeve hem ioye, and so hadde he don,\nand thus thei ride forth theire iourney.  But now shull we\nspeke of Gawein. Whan that sir Gawein was passed the duerf knyght, and\nthe damesell wele a two bowe draught, a-noon he\nfelte that the sleeves of his hauberk passed fer of lengthe ouer\nhis hondes, and also the lengthe of his hauberk henge down\nbe-nethe his feet, and his legges were waxen so short that thei\npassed not the skirtes of the sadill; and be-hilde and saugh\nhow his hosen of stiell resten in the stiropes, and saugh how\nhis shelde henge toward the erthe, and a-perceyved wele that\nhe was become a duerf, and seide to hym-self that that it was\nthat the damesell hadde hym promysed, and ther-with he wax\nso worth, that for a litill he hadde gon oute of his witte, and\nrode forth so in that wrathe and in that anguyssh in the foreste,\ntill he fonde a crosse and a ston therby; and thider he rode\nand a-light vpon the ston and toke his stiropes, and made hem\nshorter, and his hosen of stiel, and the renges of his swerde,\nand the gige of his shilde, and the sleves of his hauberk,\nwith thonges of lether vpon his shuldres, and a-raied hym in\nthe beste wise he myght, so wroth and angry, that he hadde leuer to be deed than on lyve; and after that he lepte vp and\nrode forth his wey, and cursed the day and the hour that euer\nhe entred in to that quest, for shamed he was and dishonoured;\nand so hath he gon in this maner that neuer he lefte castell,\nne town, ne burgh, but that he asked tidinges of Merlin of alle\nthe men and women that he mette, and many oon he mette that\ngrete shame and grete reproves hym seiden; and neuertheles he\ndide many prowesses, ffor though he were a duerf and\nmysshapen he hadde not loste his strengthe, neithir his hardinesse,\nand many a knyght he conquered; and whan he hadde serched\nthe reame of logres vp and down, and saugh that he cowde not\nfinde Merlin, he thought to passe the see, and go in to the\nlitill Breteigne; and so he dide, and serched it fer and nygh,\nbut neuer cowde he here no tidinge of Merlin, and so it drough\nnygh the terme that he hadde promysed to returne; and than\nhe seide to hym-self, \"Allas, what shall I now do for the terme\na-proched that I muste returne by the oth that haue sworn\nto myn oncle to repeire; returne moste I nede, for elles sholde\nI be for-sworn and vn-trewe, and that will I not in no maner,\nffor the oth was soche that yef I were in my delyuer powste,\nand in my powste am I nought, for I am disfigured and\na thinge of grete dispite, and I haue nought of my-self, and\ntherfore may I wele a-bide of goinge to court.  Certes now\nhaue I euell seide, ffor neuer will I be for-sworne for to go ne\nto come what persone that euer I be, and for that I am not\nshet in prison I may go at my wille, and I may not a-bide but\nI be for-sworne, and ther-fore me be-houeth to go, ffor\nvntrouthe will I never do; but I pray to god to haue of me mercy\nand pite, ffor my body is shamefully and lothly arayed.\"  In\nthese complayntes that sir Gawein ther made, he returned bak\nfor to com to courte, and fill as he rode thourgh the foreste of\nBrocheliande, and wolde turne for to come to the see, and euer\nas he rode he  made grete moone; and as he made this\nweymentacion he herde a voice a litill vpon the right side a-bove, and\nhe turned that wey where he hadde herde the voice, and loked\nvp and down, and nothinge he saugh, but as it hadde ben a smoke of myste in the eyre that myght not passe oute; than\nhe herde a voice that seide, \"Sir Gawein, disconfort you\nnothinge, for all shall falle as it be-houeth to falle.\" Whan sir Gawein herde the voyce that hadde hym cleped\nby his right name, he ansuerde and seide, \"Who is\nthat in the name of god that to me doth speke?\"  \"How is\nthat,\" quod the voice, \"ne knowe ye me nought, ye were wonte\nto knowe me right wele, but so goth the worlde, and trewe is\nthe proverbe that the wise man seith that 'who is a fer from\nhis iye is soone for-yeten,' and so fareth it be me; ffor while\nthat I haunted the Courte, and serued the kynge Arthur and\nhis barouns, I was wele be-knowen of yow and many other,\nand for that I haue left court I am vn-knowen, and that ought\nI not to be, yef feith and trouthe regned thourgh the worlde.\"\nWhan sir Gawein herde the voice thus speke, he thought a-noon\nit was Merlin, and ansuerde a-noon, \"Certes, it is trouthe I\nought you wele for to knowe, for many tyme haue I herde youre\nspeche and ther-fore I pray you that ye will a-pere to me so\nthat I may yow se.\"  \"My lorde sir Gawein,\" quod Merlin,\n\"me shull ye neuer se, and that hevieth me sore that I may\ndo noon other; and whan ye be departed fro hens, I shall neuer\nspeke with yow no more, ne with noon other saf only with my\nleef; for neuer man shall haue power hider for to come for\nnothinge that may be-falle.  Ne fro hens may I not come oute,\nne neuer I shall come oute, ffor in all the worlde is not so\nstronge a clos as is this where-as I am, and it is nother of\nIren, ne stiell, ne tymbir, ne of ston, but it is of the aire\nwith-oute eny othir thinge be enchauntement so stronge, that it\nmay neuer be vn-don while the worlde endureth.

Ne ye may not you shewe\nto me that be the wisest man of the worlde.\"  \"Nay, but the moste fole,\" quod Merlin, \"for I wiste wele that sholde\nbe-falle, and I am soche a fole that I love a-nother better than\nmy-self, and haue hir lerned so moche, where thourgh I am thus\nbe-closed and shette in prison, ne noon may me oute bringe.\"\n\"Certes,\" seide sir Gawein, \"that me hevieth sore, and so will\nthe kynge Arthur, myn vncle, whan he it knoweth as he that\nmaketh you to be sought thourgh alle londes.\"  \"Now he\nmoste it suffre,\" quod Merlin, \"for he shall me se neuer more\nne I hym, for thus is it be-falle.  Ne neuer shall no man speke\nwith me after you, ther-fore for nought meveth eny man me\nfor to seche; ffor youre-self, a-noon as ye be turned fro hens, ye\nshull neuer here me speke; and ther-fore now returne and grete\nwele the kynge Arthur, and my lady the quene, and alle the\nbarouns, and telle hem how it is with me, and ye shull fynde\nthe kynge at Cardoell in wales; and whan ye come thider ye\nshull finde alle youre felowes ther that fro you were departed;\nand discounforte yow not of that is yow be-falle, ffor ye shall\nfynde the damesell that so hath yow mysshapen in the foreste,\nwhere-as ye hir mette, but for-yete not hir to salue, for it were\nfolye.\"  \"Sir,\" seide Gawein, \"ne nought I shall, yef god\nwill.\"  \"Now,\" quod Merlin, \"I be-teche yow to god that\nkepe the kynge Arthur and the reame of logres, as for the best\npeple of the worlde. Than departed sir Gawein gladde and sorowfull: gladde\nfor that Merlin hadde hym assured to be releveth from\nhis lothlynesse, and sory for that he hadde Merlin thus loste,\nand rode so forth till he come to the see, and passed ouer hastely\nI-nough, and than toke his wey to ride to Cardoell in walis, and\nfill that he mette the damesell that he hadde passed by\nwith-oute saluynge in the foreste; and than he remembred of that\nMerlin hadde hym seide that he sholde not for-yete hir to salue\nwhan he hir mette; and he hadde grete feer, and douted lesse\nshe passed er he myght hir salewe, and dide of his helme of\nhis heed for to se hir more clerly, and be-gan to be-holde\nbe-fore and be-hynde, and on alle sides, till that he com in the\nsame place where he mette the damesell; and than he loked be-twene two busshes, for the forest was somdell depe and\nthikke, and saugh two knyghtes that were armed at alle poyntes,\nsaf of theire sheldes and helmes, that thei hadde don of, and\nhadde theire horse reyned to theire speres that were pight in the\ngrounde, and hilde a damesell be-twene hem two, and made\nsemblaunce hir to enforce, and yet ther-to hadde thei no talent;\nffor the damesell made hem it for to do for to assaye the will\nand the corage of sir Gawein, and she made countenaunce like\nas thei hadde constreyned hir be force; and whan sir Gawein\nsaugh this, he wax wroth and rode thider gripinge his spere,\nand seide to the knyghtes that thei were but deed, for that thei\ndide force the damesell with-ynne the lordshippe of kynge Arthur;\n\"ffor ye knowe wele,\" quod he, \"that thei sholde go sure.\"\nAnd whan the damesell hym saugh, she hym ascried and seide,\n\"Gawein, now shull it be sene yef ther be soche prowesse in\nyou that ye may me delyuer from this shame.\"  \"Damesell,\"\nseide Gawein, \"so god be my socoure, as ye shull haue no\nshame ther as I may you diffende, for owther I shall dye or\nI shall you delyuer;\" and whan the knyghtes this vndirstode\nthei hadde ther-of grete disdeyne and dispite, and lepte on foote\nand laced theire helmes, for yet thei douted of hym, and\nneuertheles the damesell hadde hem assured that of hym sholde thei\nhaue noon harme, and hadde hem so enchaunted by hir art, that\nno man myght hem anoye, and ther-fore thei were the more\nsure at that tyme; and whan theire helmes were laced, thei\nhenge theire sheldes aboute theire nekkes, and seide to sir\nGawein, \"So helpe me god, false duerf, countirfeted thou art\nbut deed, and neuertheless shame vs semeth to dele with soche\na wrecche as thou art;\" and whan sir Gawein herde hym-self\ncleped duerf, and so dispised, he hadde grete sorowe in herte,\nand seide, \"As lothly wrecche as I am, in euell tyme I am\ncom to youre be-hof.

[this Quest.  And when Sir Gawain was come, then was the joy\nand mirth complete.  And Sir Gawain told them all the things\nthat had happened to him in this Quest, and the barons\nmarvelled at it very greatly.  And King Arthur was much grieved\nabout Merlin, but could do nothing more in it, and must needs\nsuffer: so they betook themselves to making the greatest mirth\nthey could for Sir Gawain. Whilst they were thus rejoicing, there entered into the\nhall Evadeam, who was twenty-two years old, and so\nbeautiful and gentle that no one handsomer could be found in\nthe two kingdoms.  And he held his damsel by the hand, and they\ncame before the king, and saluted him right courteously.  And\nthe king returned him his salute; and the knight said to him,\n\"Sire, you know me not; and no wonder, for you never saw me\nbut once, and that was in such guise that no one who saw me\nnow and had seen me then, would know me unless he had known\nme from childhood.\"  \"Certes, handsome friend,\" answered King Arthur, \"I do not recollect that I ever saw you before,\nbut you are a very handsome knight.\"  \"Sire,\" said Evadeam,\n\"do you remember a damsel who brought you a dwarf that you\nknighted?\"  \"Yes,\" said the king, \"I may well remember\nthat, for the knight has sent me five captive knights whom he\nconquered by his prowess.\" \"Sire,\" said then Evadeam, \"I am the dwarf you knighted,\nand see here is the damsel who prayed you to do\nit.  And without doubt I sent you those captives, and the four last\nof them Sir Ywain saw, for he found me fighting them in the\nvalley on Trinity eve; and next day by good hap I rode right\nat noon in the forest of Broceliande, I and my damsel, and we met\nmy lord Gawain, whom I neither hear nor see here [?]  And he\nsaluted us, and we him, and he said, \"May God give you\njoy.\"  And so God did, for at the very moment that the words slipped\nfrom his mouth I recovered the shaped and look that you see;\nfor then was I a dwarf, ugly and hideous.  So I believe verily\nthat his words and his prayer availed me so far that God\nbrought me out of the great shame in which I was; and I\nthank for it our Lord and him.\"  And then the King asked him\nwho he was, and of what people; and he told him all in order,\nas you have heard herein before.  And when the King, and Sir\nGawain, and the others heard this, they were all right glad and\nright joyous; and the King received him as a companion like\nthose of the Table Round.  And the damsel dwelt with the\nQueen in right great joy and in right great mirth.  Now here\nthe story becomes silent about King Arthur and his company,\nand returns to tell of King Ban of Benoyc , and King Bohort,\nhis brother, who was King of Gannes, who are both in their\nown lands. Here says the story that when King Arthur had departed\nfrom King Ban of Benoyc, and his brother King Bohort\nof Gannes, that the two brothers dwelt in Benoyc in right great\njoy and in right great mirth, and with them were their wives,\nwho were right beautiful and gentle.  Then it happened, as it\npleased our Lord, that King Ban had by his wife a son, who\nwas named at his baptism Gallead, and surnamed Lancelot.  This\nname of Lancelot remained to him all his life, and King Ban and\nthe Queen his wife had right great joy of him, and the Queen\nloved him so much that she fed him with her own milk.  And\nthe wife of King Bohort had a son whom they called Lyonel,\nwho was a right lovely child and well mannered; and in the\ntwelfth month afterwards she had another son whom they called\nBohort; and these three children were afterwards of great renown\nin the kingdom of Logres, and they made themselves known\nthrough all lands by their prowess.  Soon after Bohort was\nborn\u2014the youngest of the two children of King Bohort\u2014the King Bohort fell into a great sickness, and lay long in the city\nof Gannes, for which King Ban, his brother, was very sorrowful\nand in great distress; for he could not be with him as his will\nwas, on account of a neighbour of his, who bordered on him,\nand who was very fell and cruel.  This was King Claudas of the\nDesert, who was so grieved and angry (about his Castle which\nKing Arthur had caused to be levelled), that he was nearly\ngoing out his senses; and he did not know on whom to take\nvengeance, except on King Ban of Benoyc, and on King Bohort,\nwho bordered on him, because they were King Arthur's\nmen.  So he warred on them, and wrought so that he had for helper\na prince of Rome, who was named Poince Antony, and who\ncame to him right willingly, because he too hated King Arthur\nand all his, for the love of Luce, the Emperor of Rome,\nwhom they had slain.  And in this contest was killed Hoel of\nNantes, who had warred greatly on Claudas.  And the Romans\nwrought so that they had all Gaul under their dominion; and\nthey sent the men of Gaul, and the men of the Desert, and\nPoince Antony with all his Romans, to attack King Ban of\nBenoyc.  And the King defended himself right vigourously, as\none who was of great heart and of great prowess, and he fought\noften with the enemy in the open field, and often lost and often\nwon; and Leonces of Paerne, and Graciens of Trebes, and\nBannins, a godson of King Ban, did marvellous deeds of arms,\nand destroyed and slew many of the people of King Claudas;\nand Graciens died there, but Phariens died not.  And King Ban\nbecame so weakened in men [?] that he could not endure against\nthe Romans, but they attacked him so from day to day that they\ntook his castles and his fortresses, and he could never get help\nfrom King Bohort, his brother, who was lying sick in bed,\nwhence he never after rose.  And this did him great discomfort,\nfor Poince Antony had brought so many people that they took\nfrom him his city of Benoyc and all his land, so that there\nwas left to him neither castle nor city, except only the castle\nof Trebes, where Queen Helaine was, and Lancelot her son, who\nlay still in his cradle.  And king Ban had there with him as\nmany people as he could get together, but they were few to\nendure such attacks.  Bannins his godson was there, in whom\nhe trusted much, and with reason, for he was a good and loyal\nknight.  And he had a seneschal, whom he had brought up\nfrom childhood, to whom he had entrusted all his land after\nGracien's death; and this was he who betrayed him, and by\nwhom he lost the Castle of Trebes, as the Story will tell you\nhereinafter.
