Blanchardine, entring the boate, was by\nthe in- du&slong;try of two Mariners conducted to the further &slong;hore; at\nwho&slong;e arriuall, the knight of the Ferry attended to receiue him, with\n&slong;uch kinde and courteous &slong;alutations, that much encrea&slong;ed Blanchardines\nloue towards him.  and the knight, preci&slong;ely veiwing the\n&slong;ingular beautie of Blanchardine, mixt with a kinde of maie&slong;tie and\ncourage, reque&slong;ted to knowe the place of his abode, and the cau&slong;e of\nhis comming thither.  to whome Blanchardine, with princely grace\nand eloquent &slong;peech, related at large the Cuntrey where he was born,\n& the aduenture that mooued him to trauell, which was by rea&slong;on 4 sign.

How the Knight of the Ferry di&slong;cour&slong;ed at large to Blanchardine the\n&slong;tate of the Countrey, and the beautie of the Prince&slong;&slong;e thereof. [1595 edition] After this freendly repa&slong;t, which Blanchardine had receiued\nwith the Knight of the Ferry, Blanchardine riding &slong;oftly\non the riuer &slong;ide with the knight in his companie, reque&slong;ted\nhim to enforme him of this Country, & the &slong;tate thereof,\nvnder who&slong;e gouernment it then was: The knight, mo&slong;t\nde&slong;irous to &slong;ati&slong;fie Blanchardines reque&slong;t, beganne in this\n&slong;ort to vnfolde the circum&slong;tance: \"This Countrey (quoth\nhe) is called Dalmacia, wherof Tormaday is the principall and cheife Cittie, gouerned by the mo&slong;t beautifull, cha&slong;te & princely\nLady Eglantine, who is now regent and Queene therof: and by rea&slong;on\nthat diuers Kings, Lords & Princes haue &slong;olicited her in mariage\n(allured through her magnificencie and &slong;urpa&slong;&slong;ing beautie, which all\nthe world admyreth), yet her cha&slong;t life, beautified with virginitie,\ncontroles and countermaundes loue and all his lawes.  And heeruppon\n&slong;he is &slong;urnamed Eglantine the faire, Queene of Tormayday: yet the\nproude Lady in looue.  But not farre hence there is a proude Panim\nKing, called Alimodes of Ca&slong;&slong;idone, that would haue enforced our\nPrince&slong;&slong;e to marry him, after the refu&slong;all of many chri&slong;tian kings:\nand by rea&slong;on of her denyall, he is now preparing to inuade her\ndominions; and that which he cannot winne by looue and promi&slong;es,\nhe will attempt by fire and &slong;woorde: for her beautie hath carryed &slong;uch pray&slong;e and commendation throughout the world, that all the\nneighbouring Princes haue pro&slong;ecuted her loue; and euery one hath\ngiuen ouer his &slong;ute, &slong;auing Alimodes: & hee (I &slong;ay) whome no\nan&slong;weres will &slong;ati&slong;fie, endeuoreth to compell her to wed him by force.\nNow (if it &slong;hall plea&slong;e God) that you, by your haughty prowes and\nmanly courage, &slong;hall defend her from Alimodes, I doubt not but that in time (con&slong;idering your excellencie of per&slong;on and princely behauiour)\n&slong;hee may con&slong;ent to be your wife:' 'alas, Sir (quoth Blanchardine),\ncan you imagine any po&slong;&slong;ibilitie in mee to obtaine her whome &slong;o\nmany Princes of high e&slong;tates haue vndertaken, and haue their intents\nand purpo&slong;es annihilated? no, no, Sir, I neither can [n]or will pre&slong;ume\n&slong;o high: but all the &slong;eruice that my abilitie is able to perfourme,\n&slong;hall re&slong;t at her imployment and commaund.' 'Wel, &slong;ir,' an&slong;&slong;wered the knight of the ferry, 'nothing is impo&slong;&slong;ible\nin loue; and although &slong;he haue been hetherto mo&slong;t ob&slong;tinate\nand peruer&slong;e in liking; yet loue may chance to make &slong;eizure vpon\nher tender heart, when &slong;hee lea&slong;t &slong;u&slong;pecteth.

After that the batayll was fynysshed, and that the\nfolke of Subyon were all ded and taken, the\nproude pucelle in amours cam doun from the toure /\nwhere she & the countes of Castelforde were mounted\nfor to see the batayll / and cam to the castel gate for\nto welcome blanchardyn and sadoyn.  whan they were\ncom there / they fonde the erle of Castelforde, Lord Spencer's copy of Caxton ends here.  The text following is supplied from the 1595 edition of the romance. [which (euen then) was come to the Castell with many prisoners\nand rich booties of the rebels, she demaunded where\nBlanchardine and Sadony were.  'Madam,' answered\nthe old Earle, 'it is not long since they were both heere\nin our companie, and we supposed that they had bene\nalreadie entered the Castell before our comming.' When\nthe faire Queene perceiued that no tidings could be\nheard of them, fearing some mischaunce, she fell into a\nsounde, wherin she continued the space of an houre\nand more; but being recouered, she began most pitteously\nto weepe and exclaime against fortune: the old\nEarle and the Countesse recomforted her as well as they\ncould, but nothing could sort to her content. then they\nlaid her on a sumptious bed, hoping by sleepe to make\nher forget sorowe; but neither sleepe nor quiet could\nharber in her head, fearing least Blanchardine were slaine.  now Blanchardine and Sadony, hauing slaine\nthe murtherers and fettred Subbion, they mounted vpon\ntheir horses, and tied Sub- bion with cordes fast to the\nback of an other horse which they found there; and\nby the light of the Moone, tooke their way to Castelford,\nwhich was distance thence foure miles; Sadony\nleading the way, Subbion in the middest, and Blanchardine\nthe hindmost.  They posted so fast, that within\nshort time they came before the gate of the Castell,\nwhere they allighted from their horses; then knocking\nat the gates, they were presently knowne, and with\nall speed let in, leading Subbion betweene them.  the\nnewes being brought to y e Queene, her melancholy was\nturned to mirth, her sorrow to sollace, and her weeping\nto laughter.  Blanchardine commaunded that Subbion\nshould be imprisoned in the most obscure dungion\nwithin the Castell, and that himselfe would become his\nIaylor.  After which he assended vp into the Queenes\nchamber, whom he found new risen, raised by this\nhappy news, at whose entrance her spirits began to be recomforted.  and after many kisses and sweet imbracements\nthey sate downe, and spent the night in discoursing\nof their aduentures past. But when the day began to peepe, they tooke their\nhorses and rode to Tormaday, against whome (in all\nkind manner) came the aged king of Frize, who for a\nwhile had rested himself there, accompanied with all\nthe noble Knights and Burgises of Tormaday: the\nwalles were hanged with tapestry, the streets were\nstrewed with rushes and sweet smelling roses, to gratulate\ntheir comming; the matrons compiling garlands of\nsundry flowers, the Ladyes dauncing, the damsels singing,\nthe musicke sounding a sweet concordance to their\nentrie.  Thus in tryumph they assended the princely\npallace, most sumpteously adorned with rich cloth of\ngolde, embost with pearle and stone, where, by the\nwhole aduice and generall consent of all, they were\naffiaunced. The neighboring Princes, which long had bent their\ndeuotions to the sweet Saint which kept her shrine\nin Tormaday (I meane the faire and chast Lady Eglantine,\nsurnamed the proude Lady in loue), hauing receiued\nnotice by their espialls, which kept continuall residence\nwithin the Citty of Tormaday, to certifie the newes\nwhich happened there, to their Princes and Counsels,\nhearing (I say) that this Queene, whose obstinacie\na- Kellner inserted a note marker here without a note; presumably, he intended to insert the missing milestone which we have provided. gainst Cupid was incomparable, and peeuish conceit\nin loue most absurd, had nowe entred the chapter\nhouse of his mother Venus, being limed in the bush of\nBlanchardines beauty, whose large commendations and\nmagnanimious corage was caryed by the swift winges\nof flying fame throughout many Realmes and prouinces,\nthe like before was sildome or neuer heard.  These kings\n(I say) whose fancies before that time had receiued the\nperfect impression of loue in the Angellike beautie of\nthat Princely Queene, whose amber lockes trust vp in\ngolden trammels, was a sufficient addamant to draw\nall Iron hearts vnto her, now seeing all hope of her\nrecouerie past, and their desires frustrate, with franke\nand friendly consent, not only come to visit and veiw\nBlanchardine, but also brought such honorable presentes\nand Kingly Iuels to welcome him to Tormaday, and\nto congratulate the happie mariage betweene him and\nthe faire Princesse Eglantine, as their Countries and\nkingdomes did afford.  Some presented him with\nstately coursers and Iennets of seruice, some with ships\nof huge and mightie burthen, some with Pearles and\nIuels of inestimable valure.  And to be short, euery\none, though at first his foe and vtter enemie, yet in\ntime veiwing his maiesticall and princely corage, became\nhis true and faithful freends, esteeming him worthy of\ngreater honor than either their personages, presents, or\nthe obtaining of the beautifull Queene of Tormaday\ncould afford. And on the next morning, the beautifull Queene\nwas royally led to and from the Church (where she\nwas espoused to Blanchardine) by two Kings, Sadony\nand the king of Frize: and the same day crowned\nKing and Queene of Tormaday, to the exceeding comfort\nof all their subiectes and friendes.  After their\nreturne from the Church to the Court, they were\nfeasted with all possible cheere that could bee deuised:\nand after dinner the Trumpets sounded to the Iustes\nand tiltings vntill supper.  And after supper, maskes,\nplayes, and Princely deuises, spent the time till they\nwent to bed. On the morrow the feast began a-fresh, and continued\nfor the space of twentie daies.  After all which arroyalties were finysh- ed by the commandement of\nBlanchardine, was Subyon and all his accomplices\nbrought to execution.  now the neues being caried\nwith the swift wings of fame into Frizeland, the\nLords of Frize repaired to Tormaday, to accompany\nhome their aged King, and to congratulate this happy\nmarriage of Blanchardine and his new Queene. After the aged King of Frize, Father to Blanchardine,\nhad seene the espousalls of this beautifull\nQueene and his noble Sonne; being decrepit & stiffe\nwith age, hauing liued to fourscore and vpward, vnto\nwhome, although his late enlargement from captiuitie,\nand this new-come ioy of his deere sonne Blanchardine,\nbeing now married to the beautifull Queene of Tormaday,\nbred delight; Yet through debillitie of nature,\nwhich was sore infeebled by his hard imprisonment, he\nwas surprised with an vncoth malladie and extreame\ncontagion of dangerous sicknes; in the which he had\nnot long remained, but in the view of all, life began to\nvade, and death opproche.  And more to hasten on\ndeathes speedy pace to this sencles olde man, the\nnobles of Frizeland, hauing receiued sure and certaine\ninteligence from Tormaday of the life and freedome of\ntheir King at that time there, and the princely mariage\nwhich now was fully concluded betweene his successiue\nheire, their naturall leige Blanchardine, with the renouned\nLady and Queene of Tormaday, they came\nthither; at whose approche, this fainting olde man,\nhoping to receiue glad tidings from his aged wife the\nQueene of Frize, began with cheerefull countenance to\nlift himselfe vp in his bed, as though no kinde of deadly malladie or aged griefe had attainted his\nwithered limbes.  But when he had a while listened\nto the sweet harmonie of their sugred speach, which\npresaged no kind of disaster, but all pleasure and\nsollace that might be, at the length he demaunded of\nthe welfare of the aged Queene his wife; vnto whome,\nreply being made, that long time since, vpon the vnfortunate\nreport and tragicall tidings of his captiuitie by\nDarius, sonne to the Pagan king Alimodes, shee fell\nsicke and died; hee, listening to this impittious tale,\nfell as one distraught into a sound.  But comming to\nhimselfe, powred forth these speeches, the true testimonies\nof his faithfull loue: 'and is she gon, the\ncomfort of my youth, the staffe of my age, the day of\nmy night, the sonshine of my blisse, the sollace of my\nsoule, and the life of my death?  Ah! to to well I suspected\n(though alas I knew not the certentie) that my\ncaptiuitie would bring her callamity, and my imprisonment\nher death.  But since all humane flesh is mortall,\nand nothing vnder the Sunne permanent, what auailes\nmy sorowful grones and passions?  to weake, alas, to\nrecall her againe, or any way to remedie my misfortune!'\nwith these or the like exclaimes, this silly aged\nKing, panting betweene life and death, lay still a while,\ntill finding his heart ouer charged with an other passion,\nhe prosecuted his first complaint: 'O sacred Ioue,\nsearcher of all secret thoughts, whose eternall dietie\nraigneth within the highest heauens, who from my\ncradle hast destined me to perpetuall miserie, now shew\nthy self a righteous iudge, and reuenge my wronges vppon the accursed broode of infidels, who so irreligiously\nprophane thy blessed name, & suffer them not to\nescape thy reuenging powre, but at thy pleasure consume\nand confound the workers of this my woe! and\nnow dissolue my daies and weary life, & leade me\nthrough th' unknowne passages to my deere and\nsweetest wife, that though our daies on earth did finde\nsmall comfort, yet our soules in heauen may finde consolation.'\nAnd with this orizon he yeilded himself to\nGod, and died.  When the brute of this heauie tidinges\ncame to the eares of Blanchardine and his faire Queene,\nalthough they swume before in the hauen of happines,\nand floted on the floodes of al felicitie (as they thought),\nyet in that very instant and moment of time, a cloudie\nmist began to obscure their brightest sonshine, and a\nfrost of cares to ouer runne their summers blisse. Now began Blanchardine to accuse and condemne\nhimselfe of vnnaturall ingratitude and disobedience to\nhis parentes, to whome both nature and dutie bound\nhim to bee submissiue and kind; now he began to\nmaligne the time, the place, and the cause of his departure\nand priuie escape from his fathers Court.  But\nall in vaine, for as teares, praiers, nor vowes can recall\nthe dead: so had I wist, and time abused and mispent,\nis in vaine to be desired.  'And yet (quoth he) how\nvnnaturall was I to forsake them whome nature charged\nme to loue and obey! now I may iustlie accuse my self\nof the murther of these my louing parents: alas! I cannot\nexcuse my selfe, neither can I plead ignoraunce that\nI knew not that my departure would be the finishing\nof my parentes ioyes, and cause of their death, which\nnow (to my open shame) I finde most true.  And\nshould I, nay, could I, suffer my selfe to be led and\ncarried away with such vaine fantasies, as leaue them comfortles to whome I was the greatest comfort.  Die,\nBlanchardine, die! and the rather die, that art the cause\nof thy parents death: alas! to kill a man is hainous\nmurder; but to murder my parentes, a sinne against\nSanctitie: all creatures haue care to foster those that\ngaue them life; and I, careles in killing my father.\nThe Storke, when he seeth his sire olde & redy to die\nwith famine, taketh him vpon his shoulders, and feedeth\nhim by his trauaile: But I, insteede of feeding, haue\nfamisht, and in place of trauelling, haue traiterously\nouerthrowne my parents.' The Lordes of Tormaday, seeing this soddaine and\nvnexpected chaunce of the death of the aged King, &\nthe heauie plight of Blanchardine and his beautifull\nQu\u00e9ene, humbly on their knees began to expostulate\nhim in this manner: 'Noble prince! as the salue commeth\nto late, where the sore is irrecuperable; as phisicke\nis naught worth where the pacient is passing; and as\nfire giuen to the ordinance, tis to late to recall the\nshot; So, mightie King, booteles are these teares which\nare shed for the dead.  the honor of your father hath\neterniz'd his name for euer, though his body be here\ninterred; and if fame be the marke whereat all noble\nmindes do shoote, then may you boast that he cannot\ndie whose fame is so ferre spred throughout the world.\nLeaue therefore (braue King) to bewaile him whome\nyou haue cause to ioy for, and comfort our pensiue\nQueene and your faire spouse, whose torments cannot\ncease, seeing you so sad.'  As one newly risen from a\ntraunce, or out of a heauy slumber, so Blanchardine,\nhauing listened to this short and sweete discourse of his\nnobles, began to recall his sences home, which before\nwere wandring after the Ghost of his father, through the Elizian feeldes, and perceiuing sorrow to be both\nneedlesse and bootlesse, so well as the time and this\nhard occasion would permit, he began to be more\ncheereful; and so pacing toward the Queene with a\nsimpering smile, neither presaging mirth nor mourning,\nhe began to recomfort her: 'How now, faire loue?\nwhat, are your melancholies such as nothing can make\nyou merrie? sweete hart, be pacified, and shake of these\nvntimelye passions, and learne by me to disgest the\nhard and harsh pilles of vnhappie fortune.  The cause\nis mine; and if sorrow be expected in any, it is I that\nmust be sorrowful; but I haue found it both hurtfull to\nmy body and [not] auailable ? unavailable to the dead, and therefore\nhaue shaken it of as a thing of no regarde.  Let vs not\ntherefore (sweete wife) be the cause of a mournfull\ncourte, but the authors of merry company, since it hath\npleased God to sorte our haps to our harts contentments\nin our happy wedding.'  The Queene, whose sadnes\ngrew by reason of her husbands heauinesse, seeing him\nto haue so quickly dismissed his heauy passions, became\npresentlye iocond & merry; & so betweene them\ncommaunded great preparation to be forthwith made, to\nperforme the obsequies of the deceased King of Freeze,\nhis Father; which shortly, with all solemnitie fitting\nhis estate, was accomplished, to the great admiration of\nall beholders, for the sumptuous magnificencie and surpassing\npompe wherwith he was interred; all costly\nodors and sweet senting spices were bountifully bestowed vpon him; great almes and charity were dealt\nand distributed; and innumerable sollemne processions\n& praiers were made for him, in honor of his person\ndead, and loue of his Sonne liuing. Now Sadonie, who was not only a beholder, but a\nprincipall actor in all this heauy tragedie, after these\nobsequies were solemnized, and that the estate of his\nsworne freend Blanchardine and his faire Queene rested\nin perfect quiet, voyde and free both of forraine and\ndomesticall enimies, bethinking himselfe of his beautifull\nBeautrix, his trusty Regent of Cassidony (hee, I\nsay) whome loue had stonge to the quicke by his late\nmarriage, comming to Blanchardine, began thus: 'Since,\nNoble freend, and true copartner of all mishaps, that\nfortune hath spit her deadly spight, and that now\nthere remaineth no more seruice for me to doe in defence\nof your royall person, your Realme and Queene;\nand that my princely Queene languisheth at home, by\nreason of my long absence, whose princely person is\nthe true Idea of my thought; let me craue fauor to\ndepart, vntill occasion or your freendly letters call me\nhether againe, where and when I will not faile, so long\nas life shall rest within me, to do you all possible fauor\nand kindnes.'  Blanchardine (imagining by himselfe)\nthat the Sting of loue was a sufficient pricke to call\nSadony home, and that he should greatly iniury him &\nhis faire Beautrix, in withholding them a sunder; not\nonely gaue his consent for his departure, but with all\nhonor accompanied him to his ships, with his Princely\nEglantine, where, not without millions of teares and\nmany kind imbracements, they parted companie. Thus with pleasant gale and quiet tide, Neptune guiding the healme, sayled Sadony and his warlike companie\ntowardes the Realme of Cassidony, where his\nprincely Queene, the beautifull Beautrix, held her\nRoyall court, but heauy and mournfull for the absence\nof her Lorde and husband Sadony; for wrathfull\nNemisis, enuying of her good hap, and willing to heape\ngreater woes vpon the Queene, then before shee suspected,\naltered her hoped blisse into a deadly bane.\nFor when the calme silence of the night procured quiet\nto all liuing creatures, and that Hesperus, the harbenger\nof Cinthia, had giuen charge to call the inferior stars\nwith twinkling light to illumine the earth; Eolus on\nthe sodaine began to roare, and with outragious stormes\nand cruell blastes to bannish againe the starrs from the\nfirmament, & in their places to spred his dusky clouds,\nso that instead of light there was obscuritie, with huge\nand horible crakes of thuunder: By force whereof, the\nwandering Prince Sadony and his amazed company\nwere, from a sodaine hope of happy arriuall, driuen\ninto a dismall feare of drowning: then began the pittifull\nclamor of the people, seeing euery waue ready to\nswallow up the ship wherein they were caried, the foggy\nmist to thicken with cloudy vapors, that vnneth could\nthe saylors see to doe their labours.  Sadony (whose\ncorage no fortune was able to daunt) ha- uing his assured\nhope in the God whome Blanchardine made him to\nknow, seeing his company to faint and in dispaire,\nbegan to exhort and comfort them in this sort: 'Trustie companion[s] and copartners of mishap,\nsince it hath pleased the maiestie of the eternall God\nto terrifie with his thunderclaps our feeble hearts, and\nthat all hope of safetie is vtterly denied; let vs with\none consent humble our selues before his mercy seat;\nand no doubt, as in many other our calamities, so in\nthis our desperate distress, he will with the eyes of\npitty looke downe vpon our penitencie, and by his omnipotency appease the rage of these troubled seas,\nwhich threateneth imminent death and destruction.\nFrollike, deere friends! and the God of Blanchardine\ndefend us!'  The company seeing Sadonie so coragious\nand full of haughtie valor, inciting them to call vpon\nthe God of Blanchardine, euery one casting away his\ndastard feare, eleuating their hearts and hands to\nheauen, made their orizons thus: 'Imortall Iehoua,\nguider of this glorious roume! although our dim-sighted\neies haue been long couered with the obscure vaile of\nignorance, & haue abandoned our hearts from thy\nsacred law, yet since it hath pleased thee to make thy\nname and glorie knowne among vs, suffer vs not to\nmiscarie, vntill wee haue yeelded thee all conding and\nheauenly honor, so that from our lips thy praise may\nflow, and in our hearts thy diety take roote!'  No\nsooner was this short & zealous praier finished, but\nhorned Luna began to shew her head, the cloudes to\nvanish, the windes to cease, and the sea to calme,\nwhich yeelded such fuell to their faith, that for euer\nthey acknowledged the omnipotence of Blanchardines\nGod, and left the same to their posterities.  Then the\nskilfull Pilots, whose wandring course was past their\ncompasse, looking to the skyes, were directed a true\npassage by a christall starre, so that within short time\nthey reacht the shore of Cassidony, where the beautifull\nBeautrix, with her Lordly Peeres and Princely\nLadies, awaited their landing.  When Sadony was now escaped the danger of the sea, and safely come\na shore, after humble thankes to God, he seazing vpon\nthe rosiall lips of his royall Queene, in whose countenance\nsnow and blood made such a mixture, that in the opinion of all, if nature should deuise to frame\nher paragon she might fayle in perfection.  But after\nmany kinde curtesies and amiable imbracements betweene\nSadony and his Beautrix, and the Lordes and\nLadies, where euery one stroue with kindnes to welcome\nhome her loue, they repaired to the court, where,\nfor that night, the King and his Queene spent the time\nin content, and al the rest congratulated their happy\nmeetings.  On the morrow, when glorious Ph\u0153bus\nbegan to cut the cloudes, and drewe the darknes from\nthe earth, every one prepared himselfe to be ready to\nattend the princes pleasure. After Sadony had royally presented himselfe to the\nveiw of all, giuing a princely boniure to the Lordes\nand nobles, he commaunded that the soldiers, whose\ntrauels had beene great, should repaire to his presence,\nto receiue a recompence for their paines; which bountie\ndid so combine the trustie minds of all vnto him, that\nbase was he accompted, that would refuse to hazard his\nlife where and when it pleased Sadony to commaund.\nThen were the lawes, which in his absence the Qu\u00e9ene\nand Counsell had deuised, presented to him to ratifie,\nwhich he with all princely magnificencie did forthwith\nestablish, to the great admiration and singuler content\nof all his subiectes and people.  Now tatling swiftwinged\nfame, the speedy messenger of happie newes,\nceased not vntil these tidinges were brought to the\neares of the King of Spruse at the cittie Marienbourgh\n(then in his profound and deep meditations for his\nsonne Sadony), and his departed companion.  But\nwhen he heard of the hard aduentures which his sonne\nhad escaped by sea, his deliuerie from death on land, and his most happy marriage with the beautifull\nBeautrix, banishing feare (whose cankering rust had\nalmost consumed his pleasure) hee, with all his nobles\nand people, offered burnt sacrifices to their Mahon for\nthis happie tidings.  Yet not content nor satisfied in\nminde, he rigged certaine ships, wherein he and diuers\nof his Lordes embarqued themselues, longing to visite\nhis son at Cassidonie; and led by this sweete desire,\nafter they had sayled the space of one weeke, they\ncame ashore within those territories.  But when newes\nwas brought to Sadony that certaine Pagans were\narriued, and craued to bee admitted his princely presence:\nIgnorant altogether what or whence they\nshoulde be: seating himselfe in his Royall throne,\naccompanied with his faire Queene and chiefe peeres,\nhee commaunded them to bee brought to his presence,\nvpon whose approche, Sadony knowing his father by the\nmaiestie of his countenaunce, desended from his seate,\nhumbling himselfe on his kn\u00e9es at his fathers feete.  The\nfaire Beautrix vnwitting who he might be, to whome\nSadony should shewe such reuerence, stood in a maze.\nBut after she knew him to be father to Sadony, with a\nmost gracious and amiable cheere came to entertaine\nhim; to whome the King of Spruse rendred millions\nof thankes, both for the life and marriage of his\nsonne, without whose rescue hee had bin traiterously\nmurdred, and hanged by Alimodes.  But the faire\nQu\u00e9ene answered, that both her life, liuing, and people\nrested in the safetie of Sadony, 'without whome (quoth\nshee) neythir may I, nor my kingdome, continue.'  Now\nwhen the King of Spruse had listened to her zealous\nand sugred tale, fixing a stedfast countenaunce on her\nface, he seemed as one rauished in contemplation, admiring\nthe beauty and bounty of the Queene.  But Sadony,\nthinking his father (after his ariual from sea) to be\ndesirous to repose himself, led him with all maiestie into a most princely lodging; where after his repast, he\nwent to bed.  the other Lords of his troope, and all\ntheir followers, were so honorably entertained there,\nthat the commendation of Sadonies bountie was bruted\neuery where.  Now on the next morning, when (according\nto custome) Sadony and his faire Queene repaired\nto the Church to heare deuine seruice, the King of\nSpruse not suspecting that his Sonne Sadony had\naltered his religion from his Mahomet; after the\nPriestes had begun to sing a sollemne procession in\nthe honor of Christ, he, as a man distraught in sence,\nand ouercome with madding frenzy, ran vp and downe\ncursing and exclaiming against his sonne, so that neither\nperswasions, teares, vowes, nor praiers, might once appease\nhis franticke rage; till retiring himself all sollitary\ninto his chamber, tormented with passions & agonies,\nat length he fell a sleep; to whome, a little after, entred\ndiuers of the Lordes which accompanied Sadonie from\nMarienbrough with Blanchardine, and perswaded the\nKing that the idolatrous Mahomet was a false deceauer,\nand of no diety, which by sundry and wonderfull\nmiracles, they had founde Christ to be the true Messias\nand sonne of God; and, therefore, with all humilitie,\nioyntly on their knees, they entreated his maiestie to\nleaue his superstitious worshipping of blockish Mahomet,\nand with all deuotion to acknowledge Christ to\nbe the true God.  And euen at that very instant the\nstony heart of this Pagan King was mollified, who forsaking\nhis idolatrie, became a christian.  This happie\nnewes so delighted his sonne, that vnder heauen nothing\ncould make him more content.  Then laboured Sadony\nand his faire Queene, with all royaltie, to welcome their\nfather and his followers, where their entertainment was\nexceeding measure, both for magnificencie and cost.  So\npast the time a moneth or more of their abode in iollity, vntill the King, desirous to returne to Marienbourgh,\nrequested leaue of Sadony for his departure: who seeing\nthe tickle state of his fathers kingdome, in his absence,\nwanting a gouernour there, was the more willing; and\nso, all possible prouision being made, with princely\nbounty bestowed by Sadony and his Beautrix vpon the\nLords of Spruse, they accompanied the King to his\nships.  And after humble dutie done by Sadony to his\nfather, and kinde curtesie to the rest, he recommended\nthem to the mercy of Blanchardines God. Thus, Gentlemen, to satisfie your expectations, &\nperforme my promise, I find you the second part of\nBlanchardines aduentures, whose succes (if I finde as\nfortunate as his first) looke shortly, so soone as time\nand leasure will serue, for the finishing of all his\nTragidies. FINIS.", "15": "Comment Blanchandin espousa s'amie lorguilleuse damours, et\nde la grande Ioye qui y fut faite, et de la mort de subion. MS. Bibl. Nat. 24,371 Apres ce que la bataille fut finie, et que les gens subion furent tous\nmors et prins, lorguilleuse damours descendy de la tour ou elle\net la comtesse de chasteaufort estoyent montees, et vindrent a la porte\ndu chasteau, pour estre audeuant de blanchandin et sadoine. \u00b6 Quant la furent venues, elles trouverent le conte de chasteaufort\net les autres barons, qui grand foyson de prisonniers amenoyent avec\neulx, por Iceulx bouter en la place. Alors lorguilleuse damours, veant que son ami blanchandin nestoit\npoint venu, elle appella le conte, et luy demanda ou estoyent blanchandin\net sadoine \u00b6 'Madame,' ce dit le conte, 'nagaires que sy\nestoyent avec nous, si ne scay quelle part Ilz soyent tournez.  Car\nbien cuidoit que ceans fussent entrez vers vous.' \u00b6 Quant la noble damoiselle oy le conte et le preuost qui la estoit,\nqui nouuelles ne sauoyent des Barons De si hault quelle estoit chez\nparterre en jettant vng moult hault et piteulx cry.  Donc eulx qui\nla furent prins eurent moult grant douleur.  Car tous cuiderent que\nmort fust ce ce que que en elle ne sentoyent ne poulx nalaine \u00b6 Pitoiable\nchose estoit de voir la gente contesse et les autres gens que la\nestoyent / Mais tost apres lorguilleuse damours reuint a elle en Iettant\nvng parfont sauspir; puis trespiteusement se prinst a complaindre en\nregretter son leal amy blanchandin Ia nauoit si dur cuor dhomme ne\nde femme que delle neust pitie \u00b6 Le bon conte et la bonne contesse\nla reconforterent au mieulx quilz pourent, Mais ce riens ne valoit, car\nde plus en plus commencoit a renforchier son dueil / Ilz lamenerent\nen vne chambre; quant la fust venue, on la mist sur vne couche por\nlui reposer \u00b6 La comtesse et les dames furent autours delles doulantes\net explourees de ce que nullement ne la peurent rapaisier, Car point\nne cessoit de faire les plus piteulx et angoisseuses plaintes De jamais\npour son leal ami que cuidoit avoir perdu \u00b6 Mais gaires narresta que ses plaints lui seront retournes en Ioye, comme sy apres pourrez\noyr \u00b6 Blanchandin et sadoine, qui en la maison des larons estoyent,\nou Ilz trouverent subion dedens vne chambre ou Il estoit muchie\nmais ce Riens ne lui prouffita Car quant les deux vassaulx le veyrent\nla Ioye quilz en eurent fut moult grande / Ilz le prindrent et le saisirent\net lui lierent piez et mains / puis le monterent sur vng fort\ncheual que leans trouverent \u00b6 Apres saillirent hors de la place / sy\nen tirerent leurs destriers, sur lesquelz Ilz monterent, et se mirent a\nchemin vers chasteaufort, qui a deux lieues de la estoit \u00b6 Sadoine\naloit deuant, et subion apres, Et blanchandin le approuchoit derriere\nensuiant.  La luna luisoit belle et clerre / tant cheuau cherent que\nen peu despace furent deuant la port de chasteaufort, qui Ia estoit\nfermee.  Ils commencherent a huchier, en eulx faisant recongnoistre \u00b6 Quant leur venue fut sceue, de toutes pars y venoyent courrant\npour luy faire ouuerture; & si tost que dedens furent entrez, Ils descendirent\nau peront deuant la salle.  Subion fut mis en vne chartre\nmoult obscure, sans ce que oncques depuis leure que Il auoit este\nprins, Car bien sauoit que a mort estoit Iugie / Apres ce que les deux\nBarons furent leans entrez, leur venue fut noncee a lorguilleuse\ndamours, qui moult en eut grant Ioye, comme assez pouez scauoir. Tantost lui furent muez tous ses pleurs et regretz en parfecte Ioye et\nleesse.  Elle se leua en grant haste; mais ja si tost ne sceut estre\nleuee que blanchandin et sadoine ne fussent venus vers elle, dont la\nIoye fut Redoublee / Car deuant tous, elle baisa et embracha son\namy / Moult se deuiserent ensamble de plusieurs choses, La Ioye, la\nrecueillote, et la grant amour que fist blanchandin au bon conte de\nchasteaufort, au preuost, et au chevalier du gue, auec les Remerciemens\ndeulx, seroient trop longues, si reciter les vouloie.  Mais pour\ncause de briefte, men passe.  Ils passerent la nuit \u00b6 Puis, quant ce\nvint le matin, Ils sappresterent et monterent a cheual, en tenant leur\nchemin vers tourmaday, ou desia leur venue fut sceue.  Le bon Roy\nde frize, pere de blanchandin, et tous ceulx de la ville, vindrent au\ndeuant, ensemble tous les colleges de la cite, a crois et confanons pour\nreceuoir leur dame et blanchandin qui leur seigneur deuoit estre. \u00b6 Moult grand Ioye et grant feste se firent quant ce vint a lassambler \u00b6 La ville fut toute tenndue et encourtinee et Ionchie derbe verde,\npar les rues, dames et damoiselles bourgois et pucelles estoient aux\nfenestres, chantans et demenans Ioye \u00b6 La estoyent plusieurs et\ndiuers Instrumens qui Iettoyent melodieux sons.  Ils cheuaucherent\nIusques au palais, ou tous descendirent \u00b6 Moult grant Ioye y fut\ndemenee \u00b6 Apres que tous furent rasserisiez par le conseil des princes\net pareillemens de tous ceulx du Royaulme, blanchandin fianca la belle lorguilleuse damours / Puis quant ce vint a lendemain matin,\nlorguilleuse damours fut menee au moustier a destree de deux Roys \u00b6 Cest assauoir, du Roy de frize et du Roy sadoine / Et par leuesque\nde la cite furent espousez les deux amans, et furent couronnez comme\nRoy et Royne du Royaulme de tourmaday.  Moult grande et noble\nfut loffrande \u00b6 Apres ce que messe fut faicte, Ilz retournerent au\npalays ou les tables furent dreschees \u00b6 Leaue fut coruee si sasseirent\nau mengier: de leur metz ne entremetz ne vous fay long\ncompte, car moult richement furent seruis de tou ce que corps dhomme\nonpouoit aaisier \u00b6 Des habillemens et atours dont lespoux et espousee\nfurent parez ou vestuz, ne vous vueil tenir compte \u00b6 Mais bien\nvous ose dire que oncques puis ceneans parauant ne auoit ou veu ne\nsceu plus riches atours ne habillemens que sur les deux amans estoyent;\ncar tous deux estoyent tant beaulx que dieu et nature ny eust\nsceu que amendir \u00b6 Puis apres ce quilz orent disne, Ioustes tournois\ncommencerent, danses et esbatemens / Puis apres, quant temps et\nheure fut de soupper, Ilz sassirent au mengier / Se au disner avoyent\neste bien servis, aussi le furent au soupper \u00b6 Quant le soupper fut\nfait et acheue, et que tous temps fut de eulx retraire, Les deux amans\nfurent menez en vne chambre, ou Ils se coucherent ensamble, et engendrerent\ncelle nuyt vng filz qui en son temps ot nom Rambault le\nfrison \u00b6 Le quel fist et acheua pluseurs et haultes prouesses, et\nmorut en la trespitouse bataille de Ramcheuaulx, auec Roland et\noliuire, qui plus de luy vouldra sauoir, regarde en son histore, qui de\nluy fait mention, et retournerous a notre matiere \u00b6 Quant ce vint\na lendemain, tous se leuerent par le palais, et recommenca la feste qui\ndura vng Iours entiers \u00b6 Apres que la solempnite et feste des nopces furent passees par le commandement du Roy blanchandin, Subion, et\ntous ses complices furent mis a mort \u00b6 Assez tost apres les barons\ndu Royaulme de frize, arriuerent a tourmaday pour veoir le Roy leur\nseigneur, et le Roy blanchandin son filz, dont la Ioye fut renforcee. Mais quant le bon Roy sceut et fut bien aduerti que de ce monde\ntransitoire esto(it) la Royne sa femme Hors, moult grant dueil en fut\na demener.  Et aussi fist le Roy blanchandin, qui moult en fut doulant\net criste.  Mais si grant dueil nest que en la fin ne conuiengne passer.\nIa soit et que le bon Roy de frize pour quelque reconfort que on lui\nsceust faire, Il ne delaissa son dueil; et tant que du grant courroux quil en eut, Il coucha malade, dont Il morut \u00b6 Le Roy blanchandin son filz fut en tresamert desplaisance, et aussi fut la Royne sa femme,\nqui moult lamoit.  Il fut porte en terre, et son seruice et obseques faictes, comme a vng tel Roy appartint.  Apres tous les meschiefz et\nInfortunes de blanchandin et de sa dame comme Roy et Royne,\nrempliz et aournes de toutes bonnes vertus, vesquirent le demourant\nleur vie en paix et transquilite en seruice de dieu, amez et cremus de\nleurs voisins; Et eurent telle grace de nostre seigneur que ains que du\nmonde se partissent veirent leur filz grant a porter armes, et le feirent\ncouronner roy de frize \u00b6 Et vesquirent tres longtemps, en eulx gouuernant en ce monde, tellement que apres leur mort furent moult\nregretez de leurs subgetes et voisins, et dautres qui ne les congnoissoient,\npour le grant renom de leur vie \u00b6 Tellement se gouuernerent\nen ce monde transitoire, que Ilz trouuerent paix au Royaulme de cieulx.  Et sadoine son tresleal compaignon retourna en cassidoine,\nou lui et la Royne beatrix vesquirent en transquilite de ame et de\ncorps \u00b6 Ceste histoire ne touche plus auant ou gouuernement du\nRoy blanchandin, na de la Royne sa femme \u00b6 Si finirons nostre\nhystoire en priant au pere et au filz et au saint esprit, que en la fin de\nnoz Iours, nous vueille sa grace ottroyer.
