[81] And this weie is clepid [Nota de peni|tencia. &Verbar;] penytence. of whiche men schuldyn gladly herkyn & enquere with all his hert [82] to wite what his pen|aunce & whens it is clepid penytence. & in how mony maneres ben the accions of worchyng of penytence [83] & how manye spices ther ben of penytences & whiche thynges a-pertenyn & bi-houyn to penytence. Whiche thynges distourben penytence. [84] Seynt Ambrose seith that penytence is the \u00b6 What is peny|tence playnyng of man for the gilt that he hath doon. & no more to doon ony thyng for whiche hym ought to pleyne. [85] \u00b6 And som doctour seith. Penytence is the weyment|yng of man that sorwith for his synne & pyneth hym self for he hath mys doon. [86] Penytence with certeyn circumstaunces is very repentaunce of man that holde\u00fe hym self in sorow & other peyne for his giltes. [87] & for he schall be verye penytent. he schall first be-weilen the synnes that he hath doon. And stidfastly purposid in his herte to haue schrift of mouthe. & to don satisfaccion [88] & neuyr to do thyng. ffor whiche hym oughte more to be-weile or to compleyne & to con|tynue in good werkis or ellis his repentaunce maie noght a-vaile.

[95] \u00b6 And now sethyns I haue declarid you what thyng is penytence. Now schulen ye vndirstonde that ther \u00b6 Tres sunt ac|ciones peni|tencie ben thre accions of penytence. [96] \u00b6 The first is that if a man be baptiste after that he hath 1 a . accion of penytence. synned. [97] seynt Austyn seith. but he be penytence \u00b6 Augustinus. for his olde synfull lif he may not be-gynne the newe clene lif. [98] ffor certis if he be baptised with out penytence of his olde gilt. he receyue\u00fe \u00fe e mark of baptisme. but not the grace ne the remysson of his synnes till he haue verraye repentaunce. [99] \u00b6 Another defaute is this that men doon deedly synne after that \u00b6 .2. accion. thei haue receyued baptisme. [100] The \u00ferid defaute \u00b6 .3. accion. is that men fallen in venyall synnes aftir her baptisme. fro daie to daye. [101] Ther of seith seynt Austyn. \u00b6 Augustinus that penytence of good & humble folk is the penytence of euery daie. [102] \u00b6 The spices of penaunce ben thre; that oon \u00b6 The spices of penytence. of hem is solempne. Another is comune. & the .3. is pryue. [103] \u00b6 Thilk penaunce that is so|lempne \u00b6 of penaunce solempne. is in two maneres. as is to be put out of holy chirche in lente for slaughter of childryn & suche maner thyng. [104] \u00b6 Another is when a man \u00b6 Of open penaunce. hath synned openly of whiche synne the fame is openly spoken in the contre. \u00b6 And then holy chirche bi Iuge|ment distreyneth hym for to do penaunce opene. [105] Som penaunce is that preestis enioynen [Harl. 1758 extract ends ] ] Cambr. begin men in certeyn cas / As for to goon parauenture nakid in pilgrymage or barefot.

[114] \u00b6 Of the rote of contricioun spryngith a stalke that berith braunchis & leuys of Confessioun & freut of satisfaccioun [115] \u00b6 for whiche Crist seyth in his gospel / Doth digne freut of penytence / for by this freut may men knowe this tree / & not by the rote that is hid in the herte of man ne bi the braunchis ne by the leuys of Confessioun.

[771] But certis sethyns the tyme of grace cam. God ordeyned that som folk schulde be more hye in estate & hye degree & som folke more lowe & that eueriche schulde be seruyd in his estate & in degre. [772] And therfore in some contrees ther thei ben thrallis when thei han turned hem to the feith. thei maken her thrallis fre out of thraldom.
