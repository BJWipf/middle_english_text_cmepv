For so\u00fe, if \u00fee pope do \u00feeis befor o\u00feer men, \u00fean is he, by for o\u00feer men, \u00fee folower of Crist; ellis is verified in him \u00fee sentence of Crist, He \u00feat is not wi\u00fe me, he is ageyn me. And Matt. xij o . Crisostom sei\u00fe, He \u00feat desiri\u00fe primacy in &yogh;er\u00fe schal fynd confusion Crisostom. in heuen, and he schal not be countid among \u00fee seruaunts of Crist \u00feat treti\u00fe of primacy; nor no man hast to be seen more \u00fean o\u00feer, but \u00feat he be seen lower \u00fean o\u00feer; for he is not \u00fee ritwisare \u00feat is more in honor, but he \u00feat \u00fee ri&yogh;twisare, he is \u00fee more. Ensaumple ledi\u00fe us to \u00feis same \u00feus; If a man haue an \n  hired plowman in to serueys to dwel wi\u00fe him, to do ani dede, and fei\u00fefully to serue to him in to \u00feat werk, and \u00feat seruaunt obliche him to do so, &yogh;efing fei\u00fe to \u00feis; if he felle not aftir in dede and tyme aftir his hi&yogh;t and couenaund, but go\u00fe a wey \u00feer fro, and leui\u00fe to wirke, and do\u00fe contrarily directly, and in to \u00fee harme of his maistir, it is certayn \u00fean, \u00feowe he be his seruaunt of dette and oblisching, na\u00feles he is not his seruaunt in filling of werk, and so not in dede; but ra\u00feer aduersari, fals trespasor, and traytor. And \u00feus it semi\u00fe in \u00fee propos. If ani chosun of God himselue, and of \u00fee puple, in to pope, or prelate, and ordend in to vicar of Crist to his office in &yogh;er\u00fee, and he hi&yogh;t it; whan he filli\u00fe not in dede, but do\u00fe contrarily to his behest in degre, he semi\u00fe not to be \u00fee vicar of Crist in dede. And so, \u00feowe he be his vicar vp degre and dignite, and o\u00feer tyme in dede, wan he do\u00fe \u00fee dedis of \u00fee office, \u00feerfor \u00fee pope ioi not, or ani prelat, or o\u00feer in \u00fee nam of dignite or of state, wan it is not to perpetual blis to \u00fee soule. But al dred more lest \u00feei geit \u00feer of harme to \u00fee soule, and tymung for defaut of trespase; for \u00fei \u00feat in swelk \u00fee synne aggregi\u00fe bi resoun of \u00fee degre; for \u00feus it is writun, Joi \u00feu not of \u00fee vnpitouse Ecclus. xvi o . sonis, if \u00fee drede of God is not befor hem; for better is oon dredan God, \u00fean a \u00feow&yogh;and vnpitouse. And better to die wi\u00fe out barnes, \u00fean to lef vnpitouse barnis aftir. And efte \u00feus sei\u00fe Crist; Joi &yogh;e not for spiritis are sogetis to &yogh;owe, but joi &yogh;e \u00feat &yogh;or namis Luc. x o . are writun in heuen. And eft sei\u00fe \u00fee gospel, Maki\u00fe wor\u00fei frutis of Matt. iii o . penaunce, and wil &yogh;e not sei wi\u00fein &yogh;or self we haue \u00fee fadir Abra|ham, for God is mi&yogh;ti of \u00fee stonis to reise \u00fee sonis of Habraham; for now is \u00fee axe sett to \u00fee rote of \u00fee tree, \u00feerfor ilk tree \u00feat maki\u00fe not good fru&yogh;t, schal be kyt doun, and cast in to \u00fee fire. And eft Jerom sei\u00fe; It is not li&yogh;t to stond in \u00fee place of Petir and Jerom. Poule, and hold \u00fee chaur of hem \u00feat regnun wi\u00fe Crist; for \u00feer of it is seid; \u00feei are not \u00fee sonis of seyntis \u00feat holdun \u00feer placis, but \u00feei \u00feat vse \u00feer werkis. An Gregor sei\u00fe, We \u00feat are prestis how Gregor. to ask to knowe, not of dignite of place, ne of kirkis, but of nobley of maneris; not bi clerte of citees, but bi purte of fei\u00fe; places ne orderis makun not vs nekist God, but o\u00feer good meritis ioynun to gidir, or ellis departen, \u00feat is wit, as to mede merit and blis. And Crisostom sei\u00fe; A cristun man falli\u00fe strongli in to synne for two Crisostom. causis, o\u00feer for gretness of \u00fee synne, or for hei&yogh;t of \u00fee dignite. Also of \u00fee dedis of Boneface \u00fee martir; If \u00fee pope ben tan rekles Bonef. of his and his bre\u00feer's &yogh;ele, vnprofitable and slow in his dedis, more ouer and stille fro good, \u00feat more noye\u00fe to him and alle o\u00feer, \u00fean he ledi\u00fe wi\u00fe him silf going bifore to helle peple wi\u00fe outun nowmbre, to be dongun wi\u00fe him wi\u00feouten ende, wi\u00fe mani digingis. \u00feerfor, si\u00fe \u00fee office of Crist [on] \u00fee &yogh;erd was to liue most purist and mekly, and to preche bisili \u00fee word of God to \u00fee peple, and to calle hem a&yogh;en to \u00fee lord God, fadir of alle, and in to \u00fee vnite and prosperite of body, and cam to serue and not be seruid, and to &yogh;if his lif raumsum for mani, and bi \u00feis ha\u00fe &yogh;efun to vs mani good \u00feingis, and to fille \u00feis ordeynid Petir, seying to Joh. xxi o . him, lufist me? feed my schep, and folow me, and in him he biddi\u00fe \u00fee same to alle successors of Petre, as als in Petir a gaf to hem power of bindyng and lowsing, and \u00feus ordeynd him his vicar, and \u00feus his successor; and Petir himsilf \u00feus fillid \u00fee office of Crist, in liuing, and in teching, and in \u00feoling; and \u00feis same he biddi\u00fe to his successors, as is opun in his pistil. But \u00feei \u00feat do not in dede, it is clere \u00feat in dede \u00feei hald not, ne do, his office, ne office of Crist; and \u00feus it semi\u00fe \u00feat \u00feei are not led be \u00fee same spirit. \u00feerfor as be \u00fee dedis of Crist in his persoun, and bi \u00fee dedis \u00feat he dide in Petre, moost goodis are comyn to vs in \u00feis tyme, and in tyme to come, so it is to drede, \u00feat bi \u00fee slownes of \u00fee pope, and of prelats succedand in his place, and bi her peruerse werkis, moost iuil comi\u00fe to vs, bo\u00fe of synnis and of peyn, now in \u00feis tyme, and ay to dwell wi\u00fe vs, but if we mend. And \u00feus I graunt now, as oft I haue knowlechid bifor mani wit|nes, \u00feat \u00fee lawfulli ordenid his Cristis vicar, or wan he do\u00fe, or biddi\u00fe, ony \u00feing in \u00fee nam of Crist, as if Crist do \u00feat bi him, \u00feat \u00fean he is \u00fee vicar of Crist in dede, and \u00fean it is to obey to him, as to Cristis vicar, and as to Jhu Crist. And so to folow after \u00fee sentence of \u00fee apostel seyng; Be my folowars as I am Cristis. 1 Cor. xi o . And eft, &yogh;e tok me, he sei\u00fe, as an aungel, &yogh;e as Crist Jhu , for Crist Gal. iv o . speki\u00fe in me, and he \u00feat dispici\u00fe our teching, dispici\u00fe not man, but God \u00feat &yogh;af his Holy Gost in vs, for Crist sei\u00fe, he \u00feat heri\u00fe &yogh;ow, 1 Thes. iv o . heri\u00fe me, and he \u00feat dispici\u00fe &yogh;ow dispisi\u00fe me, \u00feat is, wan &yogh;e spek Luc. x o . of my spirit.

But wan \u00fee pope go\u00fe a wey fro Crist, and do\u00fe \u00fee contrari, as is be for seid, or do\u00fe \u00fee contrari, \u00fean is not he Cristis vicar, ne it is not to obey ne folow him in \u00feeis \u00feingis. \u00feus haue I oft seid; and, as I suppose, cordandli wi\u00fe holi writ, and fei\u00feful doctors, and autentik decreis. And it semi\u00fe me, \u00feat it be howfi\u00fe me to sey \u00feus, for it is knowun \u00feat many popis han synnyd, and ben snibbid; and sum tan in heresy and deposid.

And \u00feus is a man of harmis seid better \u00fean an o\u00feer, and a prest better \u00fean an o\u00feer, and a religious man better \u00fean an o\u00feer, and a housbond better \u00fean an o\u00feer, for he can better, and do\u00fe better \u00fean \u00fee to\u00feer.
