THE Englis See pag. 12, 13. of a most rare Book, be|ing Mr. Thomas Ellis's imper|fect Edition (with great Im|provements) of Dr. Powell's History, to which is prefix'd Sir John Prise's Description of Wales. Oxon. 1653. 4 to. I call it imperfect, because it was never near compleated by Mr. Ellis, as will appear from the following Remark, which I have written at the beginning of my Copy that I happen'd to purchase in the Year 1722. \"The following Description of Wales was published by Mr. Thomas Ellis, A. M. and Fellow of Jesus Coll. Oxon. but 'tis much altered from the Edition which Dr. Powell set out, with the His|tory of Cambria, now call|ed Wales, at Lond. in 1584. 4 to. The said Mr. Thomas Ellis was a learned Man, and a very great Antiquary. He began also to reprint the said History of Cambria, which was grown (and is now) very scarce. In order to which that great Antiquary, Rob. Vaughan of Hengwort in Merionethshire, Esq. (who was diverted by other Business from publishing this Work, as he otherwise designed) com|municated to him his Correc|tions and Additions. But Mr. Ellis finding, that a paul|try, illitterate Author, called Percie Enderbie, had been be|fore hand with him, and some way or other had got Mr. Vaughan's Notes also, and was so bold, as, without Mr. Vaughan's leave, to print them in his Book (which is but a poor thing) in Folio call'd , Cambria Triumphans: or, an|cient and modern British and Welsh Histories, he laid by his Design, and so no more was printed than 128. Pages, all which are here. After he had desisted (for which all curious and learned Men were very sorry, he being so very capa|ble of doing great Matters) the Copies, all but a very few, were sold for wast Paper. upon which account the Book is now a wonderfull Rarity, and highly valuable. Dr. Powell's Additions are marked thus . Mr. Vaughan's thus \u00b6. This Book belong'd to the Revd. Mr. Josiah Pullen, M. A. and Vice-Principal of Magd.

But the chief reason of my referring here to Mr. Ellis's imperfect Ed. of Dr. Powell's Hist. of Cambria is upon account of a Passage that is there published, (as 'tis also in Dr. Powell's own genuine Ed.) out of John Castoreus or Bever, which will very much illustrate this Place of Langtoft. kynges turned, \u00feei mot do nomore, Bot soiorned \u00feam a while in rest a Bangore, \u00feat ilk a kyng of reame suld mak him alle redie.

Scho The Author hath here an eye upon the History of Ead|burg, (or, as he just above writes her, Edburgh) King Brictrick's Queen, who was Daughter of Offa, K. of Mercia; but, as he hath represented it, it is very obscure and imperfect; and whereas he tells us, that Bri|ctrick was buried at Tewksbury, others assure us, that it was at Warhame, Whence the Saxon Annals. An. DCCLXXXIV. Her Cyneheard of-sloh Cy|newulf cyning. & he \u00fe\u00e6r we|ar\u00f0 of-flegen. & LXXXIV. monna mid him. And \u00fea on|feng Byrhtric West-Seaxna rices. & he ricsode XVI. gear. and his f\u00e6deren-cyn ge\u00f0 to Cerdice. The story of Eadburg is given at large by several Writers. She was a most beau|tifull Lady, and had gained the Affections of the King her Hus|band (a good natured mild Prince) so much, that he was governed and directed more by her, than was consistent with his Royal Dignity. She was of a very haughty, proud temper, and could not brook, that the King should have any favourites, but such as she approved of. So that if she saw, or knew of, any, that, without her special con|sent and approbation, were countenanced, and particularly respected by him, she contrived methods to make such away. There happened to be a very delicate, fine young Gentleman (Son, it seems, as Langtoft in|forms us, to the King of Kent) that the King shew'd a more than ordinary kindness to, both upon account of his exquisite beauty, and the excellency of his understanding. The youth was perfectly innocent, and the King (notwithstanding an Usurper, as being not of the right line [ See Dr. Brady's History of the Succes|sion, p. 359. ]) of too virtuous a nature to cause any just grounds of suspicion, that there was any immorality in the case. The Queen, however, thought otherwise. She look'd upon the youth as the King's minion, and her jealousy wrought her to such a pitch of madness, that she pre|par'd a potion for him (an or|dinary practise with her, when she had a mind to vent her spleen) that prov'd fatal not only to the lovely youth, but even to the King himself, who had the misfortune (tho' quite contrary to her design) to tast first of the cup. This raised the indignation of the King's Sub|jects to such a degree, that she was forced, for security, to fly beyond Sea, and the West-Sax|ons thereupon resolv'd, that, for the future, no Queen should sit on the throne with the King, nor be stil'd his Queen, but only the King's wife. But this custom being look'd upon as barbarous and very dishonourable, it was soon after broke by King Ethel|wolf ( father to \u00c6lfred the Great ) notwithstanding in the times of some of his successors there was often a respect had unto it, as I have shew'd in my Notes upon Sir John Spelman's Life of K. \u00c6lfred, p. 24. to which place I shall refer the Reader, and, upon this occa|sion, will only beg leave to in|sert, what is said about King Brictrick in the prose additions to the MS. of Robert of Glou|cester, that belongs to the He|ralds Office. After him [ Kyne|wulfe ] Brightrik regned. xvi. yere, more studious a boute pees thanne bataille. This toke to wyfe Edburge, kyng Offes doughter of Merchene|riche. Whiche Edburge stu|ried her lorde a yenst gilt|lese men, notwithstandyng that him self was meoke and benynge. And yf she ne myght nat come to here purpose by counseille to ouercome thoo that here liked by werre, sheo dude hem be slayne by poy|son. This was preued in a yonglyng of the kynges whiche he muche loued, which heo with her poysen sloughe. And after that the kyng deyde \u00feorgh a drenche, whiche vnwytyng the quene he dranke, of hure makyng. and whenne the tythinge here of was sprong oute, thulke wikked quene by the comminalte was driue oute of the countre, and a statute i made a mong the West|Saxones, that no quene af|terwarde shulde sitte by the kynge atte mete, ne be clepud quene, for the malice of Ed|burge forsaiden. And sheo \u00feen wendyng to kyng Charles the gret Charles of Fraunce, bi the grete. happe on a tyme, as she was essheked of him, whether sheo hadde lyuer haue him, than his sone that stode ther by, into housbond, sheo chees his sone. Thenne Charles, of he answere a|meved, saide thus. Yf thow haddest chose me, thow shuld|est haue hadde my sone; but for thow castest me a way, and chese my sone, nother him ne me shalt \u00feow haue. And then he putte her in a abbey, where she was wor|shipfulliche I founde. but af|ter sheo was founde gylty in lecherie, wherefore she was putte oute ther of. Kyng Bryghtryc had take these to wyue as for the mightyest kynge's doughter of En|glisshemen, that thourgh the affinite of hure he myghte haue his regne atte his wille, and putte of his Enmys the lightloker, and a gaste the rebelle to him. By the helpe of this kyng Offe he droff in to Fraunce Egbright, of the kynge's kynrede alone a lyf, and whiche he most dradde to be a yenst hym and contrarie to his profytes. For this Brightric, and other kynges fram Ine to him, were oute of the right lyne of kynges, as of Certikes kyn. Whanne Egbright thus was exiled, to Brightric a newe gre|uance yut sprong.

Whiche ship|pes aspied the plenteuous|nesse of the londe and the ver|tues of the men ther inne dwellyng, and they thenne wendyng home a ye, brought more peple, and assaide to stroye the contre, so that they toke the kyngus toune that was neighe and robbed hit. but anon, for drede of the peple rennyng therto, they flow to her shippus, lesyng her praye. And whenne Brigheric [ sic ] was dede, as aboue is saide, by poyson happeliche I dronke, atte Warham his body was take to buriels. purueid \u00feat poyson \u00feorgh hatered of old.

VIII o . Himself did it wirke, he was \u00fear This king, in remembrance of the great Victory he had ob|tain'd over Harold (by which he got Possession of England) founded the great Abbey of Battel in Sussex. But then that, for which I am chiefly obliged to make this Note, is, his founding the Cluniack Abbey of Bermondsey in Surrey, if we may give any credit to John Rastall's Chronicle, which is a most rare Book (as I have be|fore noted) and was written by a learned Man (tho' a Printer, for Printers then were Men of Learning) who had married E|lizabeth, the Sister of Sir Tho|mas More, which was of no small Advantage to him in the History of our English Affairs. The Words in Rastall are these. \u00b6 This wyllyam made the newe forest in Hampshyre and therfore cast downe dyuers churches by the space of. xxx. myles. In his tyme he kept the englysshemen so lowe &verbar; that fewe of them bare any offyce of honour or rule &verbar; but somwhat he fauored the citye of London. Also he buylded two abbayes in En|glande &verbar; that is to say the abbaye of Battell &verbar; where he wanne the fylde agaynst Ha|rolde and the abbay of Bar|meseye in Southwarke besyde London &verbar; and also he buyld|ed. ii. other abbayes in Nor|mandye. Which Words will give some Confirmation to what is asserted by those, that tell us, that William the Conqueror built many abbyes of the order of Cluny, in relation to which there is this Note in a MS. in the Bodleian Library, as is observ'd by the learned Dr. Tanner. A Note (saith the Dr. Pref. to his Not. Mon. p. 42.) annexed to an old MS. book of Ecclesiastical Constitutions in the Bodleian Library [Inter MSS. Junian. 121.] desires us to note the slyght of the Pope, that when he had causyd the Deuke of Norman|dy to Conquer England; under pretence of penance causyd him to give muche Lands to Abbyes, and that Deuke dyd bylde many of the Order of Cluny , because Pope Gregory VI. was a monk of Cluny. Tho' I cannot find ( continues the Dr. ) that ever he founded any of this Order, yet he built and endowed the great Abbies of Battel Com. Suss. and Selby in Com. Ebor. and the Priory of Hitchinbroke in Com. Hunt. and the Alien|Priories of Frampton in Com. Dors. Paunsfeld in Com. Essex, Derehirst in Com. Gloc. Ando|ver in Com. Hants. and Stanyng in Com.

But then others (and even Peter of Langtoft and Robert of Brunne themselves seem to have been of the same opinion) tell us, that this was not the New Fo|rest near Winchester, but the New Forest of Windsor, a|mong which is John Rastall, who writes thus: This kynge wyllyam as is sayd & wryt|ten of hym &verbar; had great plea|sure in huntynge &verbar; in so moche that he pulled downe & di|stroyed dyuers houses of re|ligyon to inlarge the newe forest of wyndesore for wylde dere: but a knyght of his named water Tyrell by the glaunsyng of his arowe vpon a braunche whan he shot at an harte in the sayd forest &verbar; smote the kyng & wounded hym to dethe wherof shortely he dyed.

To which may be here added, that as nei|ther Robert of Gloucester, nor the Chronicle of Peter Lantoft ( that I now publish ) say, that Robert Duke of Normandy's Eyes were pulled out, so neither does John Rastall say any thing of that matter, as well knowing ( and Sir Tho. More too had told him the truth of that part of our History ) that the Story was not vouch'd by such Historians, as came nearest to Duke Ro|bert's time. But I shall put down the Words of Rastall at large, because they will give some light to the Reader as he is perusing this work of Peter Langtoft. \u00b6 In the seconde yere of his [ Hen. the First's ] reygne Robert Courteyse his brother duke of Normandye &verbar; whiche had ben longe tyme oc|cupyed in warre agaynst Chrys|tes enemyes hauynge worde of the dethe of his brother wyl|lyam Rufus &verbar; and that his brother henry had takyn vp|on hym to be kynge of Eng|lande &verbar; made preparacyon in Normandye and came ouer into Englande with a great hoost to chalenge the crowne.

And who so euer lyued longest to be others heyre. And sone after that &verbar; this Robert departed agayne into Normandye.

In this tyme began great warre in Normandye be|twene kyng Henry & kynge Philyp of Fraunce &verbar; but kyng Philyp sone after dyed. \u00b6 About the. iiii. yere of this kyng &verbar; Robert Curteyse came into England agayne &verbar; to his brother henry whiche made hym great chere that before that Robert departed &verbar; he released to his brother the forenamed trybute of. iii. M. markes &verbar; & departed agayne into Normandye. After this a great varyaunce fell be|twene this Robert and his lordes in Normandye that they sent vnto kyng henry his brother wyllynge for to come into Normandye &verbar; & they wolde delyuer hym the contrey. And also by the intyssement of yll tale tellers &verbar; a great va|ryaunce fell betwene kynge henry & his battel in Norman|dye. brother Robert &verbar; that the kynge with a great armye sayled into Normandye &verbar; & with the helpe of the lordes there &verbar; chased his brother Ro|bert from place to place &verbar; and wanne from hym Roan &verbar; Cane &verbar; Faloys &verbar; and all the good townes & many castels.

Aufrice to aspie him were better haf left, \u00feer in \u00feorgh felonie was he robbed & reft, Taken with enmys & holden in prisoun, I kan not say \u00fee pris was gyuen for his ransoun. In prison was he bonden, as \u00fee Romance sais, In cheynes & lede wonden, \u00feat heuy was of peis. A no\u00feer pyne he had, if it may be trod, With Without all doubt King Ri|chard was used very roughly, and not agreeable to his Royal Dignity, after he was impri|soned. 'Tis for that very rea|son, that some Historians tell us (notwithstanding it be not mentioned in this Chronicle) that a Lyon was brought to him when he was confined in pri|son, with an intent to have (by that means) destroyed him. But instead of that, he kill'd the Lyon (to the great confusion and astonishment of his ene|mies) by thrusting his arm into his mouth, and thereby bruis|ing him so at the heart, that he died. John Rastall is one of those, that speaks of this memo|rable Action, taking notice, at the same time, of the causes of his being set upon, and of the vast sum of money that was de|manded and paid for his ran|som. At the same time he like|wise observes, that, according to some, he was called Cure de Lyon from this Heroical Exploit, but, according to o|thers, (who take no notice of this Affair) from his invincible Cou|rage. Rastall himself seems to think, this Denomination was oc|casion'd by his killing the Lyon; and for that reason, as I take it, it is, that the wooden Cut, which he hath given us of K. Richard, represents him with the Lyon be|tween his Legs, and thrusting his right Arm down his Throat. 'Tis probable he had seen old Pictures that confirm'd this Re|presentation. 'Tis also likely, that his Brother-in-law Sir Thomas More (from whom he had receiv'd so much assistance in his Historical Enquiries) approved of it. Indeed I have not yet seen (that I remember) any other old Figure, (besides this in Rastall) in which K. Richard is drawn after this manner. And yet I cannot but think, that he was sirnamed Cure de Lyon from some par|ticular Action, rather than from his Courage in general, it being usual with our Ancestors to give Sirnames from particular remark|able Accidents, such as distin|guished them in a peculiar man|ner from other eminent persons. And as Richard I. had got a very great name for his overcom|ing the Lyon (as well as he had for abundance of other very un|common Instances of Courage) so others also strived to follow his Steps, and were forward to encounter Lyons, and were will|ing to have themselves pictured as engaging with them. And, for better remembrance of such Adventures, they were often painted in old Halls, just as were also the Encounters that Gentle|men of Activity in Feats of Arms had with any strange Knights, such as those of the Blesells, hinted at by Leland, Itin. Vol. VII. p. 61. Such Pi|ctures were look'd upon very justly as great Ornaments to Halls, and 'tis pity more care hath not been taken to preserve them. Sometimes there were figures in our old Wainscotts that had Allusion to Heroical Actions, and these, therefore, ought also to be regarded by curious Persons, who may even from thence be capable of illu|strating some Particulars in our History. I have seen curious Works of this nature in some old Houses in Oxford. They were much in vogue in Q. Elizabeth's time, as they had been also in the Reign of her Father K. Henry VIIIth. when Cabi|nets were, withall, finely adorn'd with Pictures of Antiquity, as may appear as well from other instances, as from that which had been Leland's Cabi|net in the Bodleian Library. But instead of exspatiating, I shall give Rastall's own words, as I find them in the Copy of his Chronicle that was lent me by my kind Friend Mr. Murray. \u2014This kynge Rycharde perceyued that the Chrysten people decresyd in the holy lande &verbar; aswell by in|fyrmytes as lacke of vytell &verbar; toke a truce for. iii. yere and returned whomewarde &verbar; and sent the quene his wyfe by the see &verbar; and he sayled with a small company into Histra & there landed &verbar; where he was takyn prisoner by the duke kynge rycharde takyn prisoner. of Ostreche and by him put in prison &verbar; and brought to Henry Emperour of Almayne &verbar; whiche put hym in stronge prison &verbar; and after Raunsomed hym at c. M. li. whiche duke of Ostryche was afterwarde therfore accursed of the pope for the wronge done to kynge Rycharde. \u00b6 Also for the payment of this sayd Raunsome &verbar; after|warde the woll of all the whyte monkes and chanons in Englande was solde &verbar; and rynges &verbar; iewels of prelates and vessels and chalyces of all the churches thorowe the lande &verbar; and dyuers and many shrynes scraped and spoyled of theyr golde and syluer. Dyuers causes there were as wryters reherse &verbar; that the Emperour sholde owe grudge to kynge Richarde &verbar; one was because kynge Rycharde had promysed to the Emperour an ayde for the wynnynge of the kyngdome of Cicyle &verbar; whiche the Emperour claym|ed as his inheritance &verbar; whiche promyse kynge Rycharde as he sayd brake. Another cause was for that the kyng Rycharde toke from a knyght of the duke of Ostryche the dukes banner and trode it vnder his fete in dispyte of the duke and of the Empe|rour his lorde &verbar; & therfore the duke & the Emperour were gladde to do kynge Ry|charde displeasure. \u00b6 It is sayd that a Lyon was put to kynge Rycharde beynge in prison to haue de|uoured hym &verbar; and when the Lyon was gapynge &verbar; he put his Arme in his mouthe and pulled the lyon by the harte so hard &verbar; that he slewe the lyon. And therfore some say he is called Rycharde Cure de lyon &verbar; but some say he is called Cure de lyon because of his boldenesse and hardy stomake. iren nayles sad, it sais, his fete was schod. \u00feerfor \u00fee pape of Rome cursed \u00feam wro\u00feerheile, Alle \u00feat did \u00feat dome, or \u00feerto gaf conseile.
