And so oure Shippis passid alle yn, and come be hem, and comen before the Cite of Rone, and there keste ankre as thikke as thei myght stonde; and so they segid the Cite of Rone bothe watir and by londe. \u00b6 And whanne the Erle of Warwike had thus endid and don with the toune of Cawdebecke, and alle the Engelysshe shippis were come vp in the watir of Sayne, and set before the cite of Rone, \u00b6 Thanne the Erle of Warwike turnyd hym ayen with alle his pepull, and come to the Kynge, and loggid hym with alle his pepull betwyxt Seint Katerynys and the Kynge, tille that an abbey\n  that was in trete there, was yolden to the Kynge; and thanne anon aftur he went thens and loggid hym, with alle his pepull and ordynauncis at Porte Morteuyle, to kepe that porte of the Cite. \u00b6 and thanne was the Erle of Salusbury comaundid by the Kynge to make hym redy to ryde.  And tho hasty tithyngis come, and returnynge hym ayen, and did hym byde; and there he bode be sidis the Erle of Huntyngdon, tille that the sege was endid, and wonne vp in-to the Kyngis hondis. \u00b6 And thanne come sir Vmfrey, Duke of Gloucestre, the Kyngis brothir, from the sege of Cherborugh, wiche he had wonne and gotyn be sawte and good fete of werre, and aftur lete hit stuffe with Engelisshe pepull, and with vitaile, and with othir stronge ordynauncis, as longid to werre and to worship and prophite to the Kynge of Engelond.  \u00b6 And whanne he was come doune to fore the Cite of Rone, he loggid hym with his pepull and ordynauncis at the Porte Seint Hillare, more nere his enemyes to the toune thanne eny othir man by xl. rodis of lengthe, with-ynne shotte of Gounne and quarell.  And with hym lay the Erle of Suffolke and the Lord Begeyne, with alle her retenewe and alle her ordynauncis; and manfully euyry day they ffaughten with her enemyes whanne they issewed oute of the Cite. \u00b6 And thanne come the Pryore of Kylmayne, oute of Irlond, ouyr the see, with a feyre compeny of men of armys on her Guyse, the summe of xv. c., good bodyes and manfull men to werre, and come with-ynne Sayne Mouth, and aryuyd and landid at Hareflete, and spede hem in alle haste to the Kynge, and come vnto the sege of Rone: and the Kynge tho welcomyd the pryore of Kilmayne and alle his pepull. \u00b6 And thanne come tydyngis to the Kynge that the Frensshe kynge, with an huge powere of pepull of dyuerse nacionys, and the Duke of Burgoyne with hym, with an huge compeny of Burgoynys, of Flemmyngis, and of othir Duche tungis, wold come doun to breke the sege, and keste hem to entre on the northe syde of oure hoste, because that there was lefte entre and moste pleyne grounde. \u00b6 And thanne of Kynge assyngnyd the Pryoure of Kylmayne,\n  with alle his pepull, to logge hem on the northe side, for to stoppe and kepe the weyis and passagis by the foreste of Lyonys, that none enemyes might come doune that weyis to the sege, with-oute that thei countrid with hem in fight: and of that ordynaunce thei weren fayn and glad; and thei yeden forthe in haste, and kepten the grounde and the place that the Kynge and his counseile had asingnyd hem to; and as good warriouris and as prowde men of armys they shewid hem at alle tymes vpon her enemyes, wherefore the Kynge had hem in heighe cherite for her grete manhode. \u00b6 Now wolle y telle you who weren the cheeff capteynys and gouernouris of the cite Rone.  Furste, Moune-seighnour Guy de Botelere, cheef Capteyne, bothe of the cite and of the Castell; Moune-seighnoure Ternagon, and he was Capteyne of the Porte Cauxs; Moune-seighnoure le Roche was capteyne of Porte Denysine; Moune-seighnoure Antony, he was leue-tenaunte to Moune-seighnoure Sir Guy the Botelere, Henry Chamfewe was capteyne of Porte de Pount; Iohn Matreuas was captayne of Port de la Castell; Moune-seighnoure Peneuxe was tho captayne of Port Seint Hillari; the Bastard of Teyne was tho captayne of Port Marteuyle.  \u00b6 And Graunde Iakis, a worthi warrioure, was capteyne of alle the ordynauncis of oute-warde on hors backe, and on ffote of men of armis, and Issewid oute of the Cite at alle the portis, to don there ffetes yn the poyntis of werre ayens her enemyes; and euyry of these Captaynys led v. M li . men of armys and moo. \u00b6 And whanne alle the comenmalte weren with-ynn the Cite, men myght sen many a M li ; for the heraudis nombrid hem that weren with-ynne the Cite at the bygynnynge of the sege, of men, women and childeren, iij C. M li . and x. M li . bodyes, yonge and olde.  And amonge hem weren many manfull pepull and hardy, for often tymes they Issewid oute of the Cite, pepull welle yarmyd, on hors backe and eke on ffote, oute of euyry yate an ij or iij M li . men of armys, welle arayed, and manfully countrid and foughten with oure Engelissh pepull yn dyuerse parties of the sege.  And tho that myght ascape, turnyd into the cite home ayen; and thus thei endurid longe tyme; and moche werre come fro the Cite wallis, as shott of Gounnys and quarell, for thei shot euyry day from the wallis and touris of the cite, with-ynne the space of an houre, an\n  C of Gonne-stonys and moo, and quarellis with-oute nombre; and so thei sloughe and hurte moche Engelisshe pepull. \u00b6 And oure Kynge lete make an diche all withoute, Rounde a-boute the cite, and strongly stakid it, and heggid it, for these prykeris oute on hors backe, and comaundid Syr Robert Babthorp, knyght and Countroller, to ouyr-se that this werke were don; and he did it make in alle haste.  \u00b6 And thanne they issewid oute on ffote, and fought manly as good werriouris; and tho myche pepull weren slayn on bothe sidis.  And they at the wallis and at the touris of the Cite shotten euer Gounnys, quarellis, Trepgettis, Spryngollis; and alwey on the Duke of Gloucestreis side thei diden moche harme, for thei weren loggid nexte of alle pepull to the Cite.  And euyr ther come tydyngis newe that the Burgoynys wold come and reskewe the Cite; and for ioye thereof they ronge alle the bellis in the Cite; and fro the ffirste tyme of shittynge of the yatis of the cite they ronge neuyr bellis but for tho tydyngis tille the cite was goten and yolden to the Kynge of Engelond. \u00b6 And tho the Kynge wende the Frensshe hoste had byn come, and with good wordis comfortid his pepull, and bad hem ben of good chere.  And anon tydyngis come ayen that thei were turnyd to Paris-ward ayen.  \u00b6 And thanne with-ynne ffewe dayes thei were come to Pounteyse, the nombre of iiij. M li good ffightynge men, and welle arayed.  \u00b6 And thanne the Kynge made a kry, and comaundid that euyry mane shuld ligge yn his herneys, and byn at alle tymes redy whanne her enemyes come.  And tho the Kynge lete make a lerge duche, alle withoute his hoste, and pight it full of stakes ymade sharpe, that wold perisshe, and with turnepykes, and leid there-by Gounnys redy bent in euyry partye rounde aboute this diche.  And the kynge tho comaundid his countroller Sir Robert Babthorp, knyght, to spede in alle haste this were don by his ouyr sight; and so anon this werke was endid. \u00b6 And anon come tydynges to the Kynge, there as he lay at seege; and this was on the Thorisday, that the ffrensshe hoste lay but xx. myle from hym, and wold byn there on the morough on the Fryday; and the same tydynge come to hem that were with-ynne the Cite.  \u00b6 Of these tydynge oure Kynge made moche ioye and myrthe, and artely thankyd God.  And so on\n  the Fryday oure Kynge rode to the Erle of Huntyngdon, and told to hym a wile and a good ffete of werre, and made hym ordeyne ij.  Bateillis of men of armys.  \u00b6 And the ffirste bataill thei and he redenn, and her backes toward the Cite; and that othir bataill come oute of the wode, with standerdis and baneris of the Duke of Burgoynys armys.  And these ij hostis metten, as thei had countrid, and foughten to-gederis; but non did othir harme.  And this was ordeynyd and don by the kyngis deuyse and conseile, for thei that weren with-ynne the Cite shuld haue vtturly hopid and trustid that reskewis had ben come, and that thei that weren with-ynne the Cite of men of armys shuld boldely haue issewid oute, and ffoughten vtturly with the pepull of the sege; but thei dorste not come oute of that Cite at that tyme, for thei doutid and drad, and supposid to hem but trayne, and wold not issewe oute for drede of dethe, as for that tyme, but abodyn and lokid aftur helpe, socoure, and reskewis of these Burgoynes, but ther come no comforte to hem.  but yet tho afturward the men of armys issewid oute ayen of the Cite as thei did beforn, and ffoughten manfully with oure Engelisshe-men, and myche pepull weren slayne on bothe sydis at dyuerse tymes. \u00b6 And tho it drewe nere Cristemesse; and by that tyme her vitailis scarsid sore with-ynne the Cite, for they hade nothir bred, ale, nor wyne, but watir and vynegur, that was her drynke.  And flesshe nor fisshe they had non, but eten hors, doggis, Mis, Rattis and Cattis; for an quarter of an horse, were he lene or fatte, was tho sold in the Cite amonge the pepull for an C.s. good payment, and an hors hede for xx. s., and a Ratte for xl. d.; and for xiij. s. iiij. d. thei sold a Catte, and a mows for xx. d.; and these wormys weren bought and eten so faste that vnnethe thei fonde eny for to selle for no money.  \u00b6 And tho was a ferthynge lof boght in the Cite for a ffranke.  And thanne hem failid bothe whete, and mele, and alle othir graynys that thei myght make of eny brede; but branne and broken wo[r]tis, and nepe-rotis, and lekis, was to hem mete of grete valewe; for a leke was sold for\n  xij. d., and an Egge for ix d., and an appull for x d.: siche merchaundyse was there with-ynne the Cite a gret while; and ther was many a carefulle creature, for her vitailis were alle wastid and spent, and \u00feey myght come to no new by no maner wey; for the sege that lay withoute, rounde aboute the Cite, wold suffre no vitaile come in, to hem, neythir by watir neythir be londe. \u00b6 And thanne be-ganne the pepull with-ynne the Cite to deie faste, bothe smale and grete, for the passynge hungur and enfamen that was amonge hem, by C.C. personys and moo day by day; and there as was firste ioy and pryde, and grete boste, tho was there amonge hem weylynge, sorow and care, and wepynge, and wryngynge with hondis.  \u00b6 And though a child shuld deie, the modir wold yeue it no brede ne nought ellis of othir fode, ne wold not departe no morselle though she myght saue the lif of her child of hir body borne, but wold saue her selfe while she myght; for loue and hertly kyndenesse was tho from hem passid.  Nor the child wold not profir the modir; for eche of hem caste hymself to leue; for alle kyndenesse and loue tho was sette beside; for euyr the childe wold hide his mete and his drynke fro his modir and from alle his othir ffryndis, for his mete thei shuld not see, for thei ete hit alle in pryuete.  \u00b6 And we may preue by that pepull there, that houngir passithe kyndenesse and eke loue, that made her vnrightwesnesse and her cursid leuynge and pryde that regnyd amongis hem in tho dayes, wherefore God sent hem a yerd of chastisement.  But yet thei that kept the wallis and touris of the Cite rounde aboute, be-cause the pepull withoute shuld not knowe nor wete of her grete nede and myschef that thei weren ynne, euyr to hold her courte and contynaunce of opyn werre, bothe with shot of Gounnys and quarellis. \u00b6 But amonge ther issewid summe pepull of the Cite oute; and they come forthe, and weren take of the wacchemen withoute at the sege Cite.  \u00b6 And they affraynyd hem how it stode with the pepull that weren lefte with-ynne the Cite.  \u00b6 And they ansuerid and told to the Engelisshe pepull of the grete nede,\n  scarste, hungir and dethe, that was euyry day amongis hem.  But our folke wold not beleue nor truste hem, be cause that the pepull with-ynne hilde alle tymes contynaunce like in werre, day be day, as thei did beforne vpon the sege withoute; wherefore thei had hem in no truste in no degre. And thanne with-ynne a litull while aftur, the worthi men that weren with-ynne the Cite, gederid alle the pore pepull that tho weren with-ynne the Cite, man, woman, and child, and brought hem to the yatis, and put hem oute at euyry porte by an C personys on a rowte, and bad hem helpe hem-self in her beste maner that thei myght, for there thei shold no lenger abyde yn no wyse with hem.  \u00b6 And thanne thei come forthe toward the Engelisshe seege, knelynge on her kneis, and wepynge sore, bothe man, and woman with yonge sowkynge children in her armys, and olde febull men knelynge besyde hem, makynge there a dilfull crye; for alle they cryed there atonys \"haue mercy on vs, ye good and Cristen and worthy men.\"  \u00b6 And thanne oure Kynge had rewthe on hem and pite, and yaf hem brede and drynke, and made hem turne ayen to the Cite; and there thei kepte hem in the diche, that thei shold not knowe nor here the ordynaunce nor counseile of the seege, ne of her wacche in no wyse, for trayne and treson that myght falle. \u00b6 And whanne these pore pepull shuld turne ayen, thei made high sorough and grete murmuracion amonge hem-self, and seyden they had leuyr byn sleyn there thanne go ayen into the Cite, and dilfully, with high voycis bannynge and cursynge her owne nacion, for thei that weren with-ynne the Cite wold not suffre hem come in ayen; wherfore y trowe thei diden grete synne and myschieff to hem-self; for meny of him deiden there for colde, that, and thei had byn with-ynne, her lifis might haue byn sauyd and kepte. \u00b6 And tho was come the tyme of Cristmesse, in whiche oure Kynge did tho grete mercy and relef to his enemyes, at the reuerence of that Glorious feste of the brythe of oure Lorde Ihesu Criste and of his blessid modir, oure Lady Seynt Marye, that\n  gracious and mercifull virgyne.  For, of high pite, mercy and grace, and at the reuerence of that tyme of the holy feste, the Kynge, of high compascion that he had in hert, and of his worthi and excellente manhode, sent oute his heraudis in good araye, bothe to hem that weren wyth-ynne the Cite as welle as with-oute the Cite, on the Cristemesse day self, to hem that lackid vitaile, that thei shold come and haue mete and drynke ynow, in worship of the Feste, and sauf-condite to come and to goo.  And thei seiden alle 'gramersis' lightly, as thei had no nede there-to, and set no pryce by his sonde.  And vnnethe thei wold graunte space vnto the pepull of her owne nacion to ben releuyd that layn in the diche vndir the Cite wallis, that thei had drouen and put oute of grete myschieff.  But two preestis and iiij seruauntis for to brynge hem vitailles, mete and drynke; and if ther come eny moo personys, thei wold shete to hem and sle hem to dethe.  \u00b6 And thanne weren alle these pore pepull set arowe; and these two preestis with her iiij. seruauntis broughten hem plente of mete and drynke, of the Kyngis gracious almys; and so thei weren at that tyme made welle at eese; and replete of mete and drynke.  And as thei sete her mete to fonge, this talkynge thei had amongis hem.  \u00b6 \"A, almyghty God,\" thanne thei seide, \"the Engelisshe-men by of good and treue herte!  Lo, how here this excellent Prynce and Kynge that we thought neuyr to obey vnto, ne neuyr profre ne don hym homage, now hathe he on vs more pite and compassion by a M ll thanne hathe oure owne nacion; therefore, oure Lord God, that art full of myght, graunte hym grace to wynne and gete his trewe right!\"  Thus the pore pepull for the Kynge prayde; that God kepe and mayntene hym in alle his nedis.  \u00b6 Whanne thei had thus seruyd alle the pore pepull with mete and drynke, and were welle reffresshid, oure folke turnyd ayen to the Kynge, for the trewse lastid no lengur but that same day. \u00b6 And whanne the nyght be-ganne to apere and shewe, thanne thei on the wallis beganne newe werre ayen vpon the seege, and wacchidden a ward that full streyte bothe day and nyght with hungir smerte, for that tyme her vitaill weren alle wastid and spente.  And meny a worthy body for defaute of lyuelod of mete\n  and drynke was spent and ded,for euyr grete houngir brekithe herd stonen wall yn hir grete nede; for euyr the lif is dere and suete. \u00b6 Thanne alle the Capteynys of that Cite, bothe Baillis, Burgeses and communnalte, toke her the counseill with-ynne hem self to trete with the Kynge; and with the pepull the cause pryncipall for the high myschieff that tho was amongis hem of enfamenynge for hungir; for thei knewe welle thei myght note longe endure so; and for the sodeyne and multitude dethe that was euyry day amonges hem for lakke of ffode, vpon the New Yeris Euyn at nyght, the pepull with-ynne come to the wallis at euyry porte to the seege, and clepedyn a knyght to speke with hem; and there was non man that tyme that hem herd tille thei come to the Porte de Pounte of Sayne.  \u00b6 And that was on that side as the Erle of Huntyngdon kepte the ward.  And there thei weren herd, and answerid tho ayen, and askid what thei wold: and thei ansuerid and seid, and prayed at the reuerence of Allmyghty God, if ther were eny gentill knynght that wold here her complaynte, and bere her erende vnto the Kynge.  \u00b6: And thanne oon ansuerid and seid, he was a knyght; and thei preyd hym to telle hys name.  And he seid, \"my name ys Vmfreuyle;\" and thei thankid God and oure Lady that thei had mette with hym, for he was of the old blode of that contre of Normandye; \"and we praye you to helpe vs haue an ende betwene youre Kynge and vs.\"  And he seid, \"what is youre wille?\"  and thei seid at fewe wordis: \"we haue byn at euyry porte of the City there these Pryncis loggyn before, and haue callid aftur speche of hem; but we coude haue non ansuere: ffirste at the Duke of Clarence, the excellente prynce; and from thens to the Duke of Gloucestre, his worthi brothir; and ofte we clepid, and longe there stode; and so we come doune to the Duke of Exeture, and there we gate non ansuere. \"And at Warwike, that Erle so fre, We callid ofte: it wold not be; And at the Erle Marchall we were. ther was no wight that wold us ansuere. And we haue clepid at all these so moche, But non ansuere we coude gete truliche; therefore we pray these princis, for Mari sake, And for that Lordis loue that did vs make, As thei ben dukis of high dyngnyte, And cheeftaynys of cheualrye, Vnto the Kynge to prey for vs, And we may fynde hym so gracious; And we wolle gon with you also Vnto the Kynge, and speke hym to, And beseche hym, for loue of that Kynge That made heuen, erthe, and alle thynge, With his witte and his good auyse,\u2014 Aboue alle pryncis he is pryse,\u2014 And for his owne high pryncehode, and also for his owne worthy manhode, And as he is kynge moste excellent, and to God, but to non othir, obedyent, That regnythe here in erthe by ryght, But only to oure Ihesu full of myght, And with-ynne hym selff Emperoure, and also Almyghti kynge and conqueroure, That he hym-self wold graunte vs space, and sauf-condite, and alle his grace, Nought-withstondynge oure offence, That we myght come to his presence, xij. men of vs by on assent, That lordly Kynge to telle fully oure entent.

Thanne Vmfrey toke his leue, and his message he went to meue. To Gloucestre thanne did he goo, To Exetur the Duke also, and told hem the tydyngis how it was. thei thonkyd God of his high grace, that her enemyes, ayens her wille, ffor nede of socoure wold yold him tille; and seid thei wold, for Goddis sake, helpe for hem a good ende to make. loo these pryncis of high mekenesse,\u2014 God kepe hem yn hele and from sikenesse!\u2014 Though thei haue suffrid peynys smerte, yet haue thei mercy and pite in herte. Thanne Vmfreuyle, his leue he tace, and passid forthe in his space To erlis and to lordis be name; and thei hym seid all the same. Lo! these cheefenteynys of cheualrie, how thei weren come in cherite! therfore God, of his grete grace, yef hem good spede in euyry place. thanne on Newe Yeris Day in the morny[n]g, Sir Gilbert Vmfreuyle come to the Kyng, and all this mater to hym he seid: And there of the cite mekely hym prayed. oure Kynge seid thanne, be good auyse, and also at this owne deuyse, to graunte that cite all her wille: \"let xij of hem come me tille.\" of all his lordis euyry-chone. ayens it was neuyr oone. lo! that high prynce and kynge so felle, of all erthely creaturis he is welle; lo! how he hathe prouyd hym self manfull, and as a prynce right mercifull; thei that had hym so ofte meuyd, and also hym had gretely greuyd, and also put hym yn grete coste, and of his pepull full meny loste, And withstonde hym of his right,\u2014 And now thei byn falle in his myght, and at his wille hem to greue, yf he wol put hem to myscheue; and thanne hym-self to light so lowe, of her wille to wete and knowe, and also to graunte hem to trete: that was heigh mercy and cherite. Sithe that thei had hym so agilte, and lithe in hym to don hem ben spilte; he grauntid hem grace and merciful mekenes: ffor-sothe, a child of God, y wot he is; of goodnesse and uertu he wantith no thyng; that his preisynge for a kynge. therefore Criste, for his passion, kepe hym in right compassion! whanne the kynge had grauntid, as y haue told, to Vmfreuyle, the knyght so bolde The Kynge seid, \"sir, whanne shalle this be?

On that othir day nexte, erliche, the Kynge made two tentis to picche,\u2014 On for the Englisshe, and on for the Frensshe; And bothe thei stode in Gloucestre trenche,\u2014 Though the stormys were neuyr so grete, drie-hedid that thei myght trete. whanne bothe pauylownys weren pight, thei went to trete with all her myght.

And Temmes \u00feat tyme was so sore frosen, that the vintage of Burdeux went ouer Shoters Hill: for \u00fee shippis with wyne myght come no nerre then Sandewiche.  and \u00feat froste \u00feat tyme distroyet oisters, and muskelles, and fresshe-water fissh, thrugh \u00fee moost party of Englond.  \u00b6 In \u00feat same yere was \u00fee trety of Arras betwene the Kyng of Englond, Henry the vj te , And Philipe, Duyke of Burgoyn; and Charles de Valoice, Dolfyn of Fraunce, that tyme beyng there in enbasshat for \u00fee Kyng of Englond, Henry, Cardynall of Englond, Bisshope of Wynchester, Iohn Kempe, Erchbisshope of York, Iohn, Erle of Huntyngton; Pole, Erle of Suffolk, Prevey Seale, Sir Waulter Hongerford, Sir Iohn Poppahm, with a faire feleshipe with hem, to \u00fee nomber of viijC men.  att which trety, \u00feai wold the Kyng of Englond shuld have putte out \u00fee floure de lice out of his Armes; and many o\u00feer thynges was spoken of; but to say shortly, \u00feei couth not accord; wherfore they departit thens, and come home ageyn into Englonde.  but thay of \u00fee toun of Popperyng in Flaundres demenet hem vngentilly, and entretid hym vnmanerly as he come rydyng\n  thrughe the toun from the saide trety of Arras; wherfore he was sore amovid and grevid with hem, for they made his men to bere out of toune \u00feeyr horses dong, mawegre their tetter; neuer\u00feeles he suffirt it, and rode on his way; but he quytte hem that foule and gret dispite, as ye shall here afterwardes. \u00b6 Then, as sone as thenbassetoures were departet from Arras, and home, the Dolfyn and the Duyke of Burgoyn were accordet, and made att one for deth of the Duyk of Burgoyns fader, \u00feat was slayn att Muttereux by \u00fee same Dolfyn; and \u00feerwith endit all that trety.  And then onon after, \u00fee Duyk tok in-to his handes Abvyle and Amyas, and o\u00feer tounes and Castelles; and after, by a kyng of heroudes, he sent the Kynges lyueray to Caleis, [and, by] the counsail of his lordes and hem of Flaundres, he made redy his ordynaunce and his pepill, to come and lay seege to Caleis.  And \u00fee Flemmynges were \u00feen so proude and hawteyn \u00feat they sette by none Englisshe men, but hem hade in gret despite, thrughe-out all Flaundres.  And grete noice \u00feere was of comyng of \u00fee seege; neuer\u00feeles Marchaundes yette went al this while into Flaundres to and fro, but thai hade evill chere in al plases.  And they of Brigges made payntet clothes, howe \u00fee Flemmynges were att seege att Caleis, and howe \u00feai wann \u00fee toune; and hanget out Englisshe men by the helis out at lopes: and well was hym \u00feat myght by of \u00fees clothes!  And \u00feai made entirledes and plaies in Brigges, of \u00fee Cardynall of Wynchester And of the Dolfyn, of thaire purposyng and Ansuaryng att the trety of Arras, And all in dispite and hoker of Englissh men; thei were so glad and fayn \u00feat they shuld lay seege to Caleis, and wynne the wulles of \u00fee staple of Caleis, and to departe it amonges hem; And bostet and said \u00feat \u00fee steevan Caleis was but a male tyde, \u00feat is to say, A mele tyde; And mony othir scornefull wordes thai had that tyme Amonges hem.  And that same yere, in \u00fee heryng tyme, \u00feere come iij C botes out of Normaundy to Caleis on fisshyng fare, as they were wont ich yere; and euery bote hade in xvj men.  and they come as ffisshers, and in ffisshers clothyng; but a gret part of hem were men of werre, and had cast to haue geton \u00fee toune.  but att last, as God wolde, the[y] were aspiet by their fyne smale shirtes and by\n  their poyntes; wherfore Richarde Woodvile, Squyer, leotenaunt of \u00fee said toun of Caleis vnder the Duyke of Bedford, charget euery souldioure to bere his staff in his hand, as wele in \u00fee cherche and att sacryng tyme as in \u00fee market, and not to leve stondyng att \u00fee chirch durre, as they were wont to do; and so thaie bare thaire stavis in \u00feeire handes in \u00fee chirch, and ouer al.  Then the Frensshe men vnderstood wele \u00feat they were aspiet, and sawe wele \u00feey couth not brynge theire entent nor purpos about; And wenth their way out of Caleis hauen in a tide, and went streight to \u00fee toune of Deepe, and come in \u00feere as ffisshers, and so gate \u00fee toun.  And in \u00feat same yere dyet the Duyke of Bedford in Roan, on Holy-Rode even in May, which had layn longe seeke; for whos deth was made muche mone amonges Englisshe men that were \u00feat tyme in Normaundy; for as long as he levit, he was doutet and dred amonges the Frenssh men. \u00b6 In the xiiij yere of the regn of \u00fee said Henry the vj te , Humfrey, Duyke of Gloucester, Protectour and Deffendour of Englond, was made Capteyn of Caleis; and he was Capteyn of Guysnes before that tyme; And so he was both Capteyn of Caleis and of Guysnes.  And he made Sir Iohn Radcliffe his Leotenaunt of Caleis, and sent hym thedir; which was a wurshipfull kny&yogh;t, and was welbelouet amonges \u00fee sawdiours there: for he kept and helde A gud and open housold to who \u00feat wolde come, and welcome.  \u00b6 Then come tithynges ich day more and more of \u00fee seege comyng to Caleis.  Then Sir John Radecliff, \u00fee Leotenaunt of \u00fee toune, Robert Clidrowe \u00fee Meyre, and Thomas Thirland, Leotenaunt of \u00fee staple of Caleis, with \u00fee sawdioures, marchaundes, and burgeses and comyners, kest vp a faire brode dike on \u00fee south side of the toune, and made iij stronge bullwerkes of erthe and cley, one att \u00fee corner of \u00fee Castell with-out \u00fee toun, ano\u00feer att Bulleyn gate, and ano\u00feer att \u00fee postern be \u00fee Princes Inne; And att Mylke gate was a faire bulwerk made of breke, \u00feat Richard Woodevile had do make or he was discharget of his leotenauntshippe.  And \u00feai fortifiet \u00fee walles, toures, and dikes on ich a side of the toune, with-in and without, And dresset theire lopes and theire gunnes to shote both hye and lawe.

And Sir Iohn Radcliff, Leotenaunt, warnet and charget al \u00fee cuntre \u00feat was of \u00fee Englisshe pale, [\u00feat \u00feey] shuld come and bring a[l] thaire goodes, and breke doun theire houses; and so, many of hem did, many of hem stale away, some into Picardy and some into Flaundres.  And \u00feere was a cry made in \u00fee market-place of Caleis, \u00feat al maner of men beyng in Caleis, or lyvyng vnder bill vnsworn, \u00feat they shuld come to \u00fee toune-hall, and there to be sworn the Kynges trewe leege men; And \u00feai that wold not be sworn, to take \u00feeire goodes and go theire way where \u00feay wold.  And so \u00feere come many, and were there sworn; and many went theire way into Flaundres, and wold not be sworn.  \u00b6 And on Saynt George day, Sir Iohn Radcliff sent word prevely to \u00fee Daywach of \u00fee toune in \u00fee nonetyme to rynge out the larom bell, vnwetyng to the sawdioures of \u00fee toune.  And so \u00feer was a grete Alarom, and saudioures were onon in thaire harneys, and comyners with hem, And wende \u00feat enmys hade comen to haue fechet the bestys \u00feat were pasteryng about the toun; but \u00feere was non; for Sir Iohn Radclif did it for a sport, because it was Saint George day; And for \u00feat he wolde se howe saudioures wold bokkell and dresse hem to \u00feeire harneys. \u00b6 And sone afterward, Edmond, Erle of Morteyn, and the Lord Camys, Sir William of Asshton, knyghte, And Sir Geffrey Werburton, knyghte, shuld haue shippit att Wynchilsey to haue gon into Fraunce with the nomber of iij M l men of speres and Archers; but because there was so gret a noys of \u00fee seege comynge to Caleis, \u00feei were contirmaundit be \u00fee Kyng and \u00fee Duyke of Gloucestre to go thider, and strenghe \u00fee toun till rescous myght be had.  And so went \u00fee Erle with his Armee to Caleis.  \u00b6 Then Humfrey, Duyke of Gloucestre, Protectoure and Deffendoure of Englond, and Capteyn of Caleis and of Guysnes, send for al \u00fee lordes of the Reame, both spirituell and temperell, and for al his feede men, and desired of hem an eyde for \u00fee rescowe of \u00fee saide toune of Caleis.

And then was it criet in al \u00fee port tounes and haven tounes in Englond, \u00feat al maner shippis \u00feat were able to saile be \u00fee see shuld come into Sandewich haven be a certeyn day; and so thei were \u00fee nomber of ij C sailes and moo.  \u00b6 Philipe, Duyke of Burgoyn, made hym redy, and the Flemmynges, al this while, and toke dyuerse marchaundes prisoners, as they come homward out of Flaundres to Caleis, and specially they of Dunkirke.  And when \u00fee Erle of Morteyn was comyn with his Armee to Caleis, as before is saide, he made a iournay of Bulleyn, xx ti myle from Caleis, and brent the subbarbes of \u00fee toune, and come to Caleis ageyn on \u00fee next day after, vnfoghten withe, and broughte with hem \u00feaire pray of bestes and theire pillage.

And whiles they ryfelt and spoilet that cuntre, and praiet in catell, al \u00feat cuntre gedert, and dome doune to Gravenyng, to mete with hym there.  And when \u00fee Erle and his meyny come dryvyng theire pray of bestes before hem, on \u00fee sandes betwene \u00fee toune of Gravenyng and \u00fee see, thay issuet out of \u00fee toune prudly, and faught with hym; but \u00feai were sone discomfit, & slayn of hem iiij C and moo:  then thai fledde in-to \u00fee toun, and \u00fee Englyshe men hem foloet, and toke many prisoners.  And \u00feer was an Englisshe man, a gentill man, and a spere on horsebake, folowet \u00fee chase of hem right to \u00fee hard gates of \u00fee toun, so nere that his hors bare hym into \u00fee toun of Gravenyng, wheder he wold or no; which after ward was delyuert be raunson.  \u00b6 The Erle \u00feen, with his pepill, drove ouer \u00fee havon of Gravenyng thaire pray of bestes, att lowe water, in spite of al \u00fee Flemmynges, and brought hem with al thaire prisoners to Caleis, and lost neuer a man; thonket be God!  and \u00feai brought so gret plente of Cowes with hem, \u00feat a man myght haue \u00fee best melche cowe \u00feat was, for xij d sterlyng.  \u00b6 And when \u00fee Kyng and \u00fee lordes had tithynges of \u00feis iournay of Gravenyng, the Kyng sent to \u00fee saide Erle of Morteyn to Caleis, the Gartur.  And onon aftirward, the Lord Camys, Sire William Asshton, And Sir Geffrey Weckton, with \u00fee garnyson of Caleis and of Guysnes, made \u00fee iij de iournay, both of horsemen and footemen, and rode before the toune of Arde, and ryfelt all the cuntre about \u00fee said toun.  And in the mene while, Sire Robert Savois, Capteyn\n  of Fynes, had gedirt of Pykardes to \u00fee nombre of iiij M l speris on horsbake, And laide hem pryvely in Campe Grove besides the Castell of Balyngham.  And when \u00fee Lord Camoys with his peple was comyng homward in the feldes be-syde the said grove, the[i] stert iij hares, and \u00feerwith \u00feay gave a gret showte; And so both horsemen and footemen, with huntyng of hem, were stragelt abrode ouer all \u00fee feldys, and were al out of array, and wist nothyng of \u00fee Pikardes \u00feat lay in \u00fee grove besides hem, but euer still showtet and huntet after \u00fee hares, which were att last slayn amonges hem.  \u00b6 And as \u00feay were so stragelt and out of Array, the Pikardes sodeynly brake out of \u00fee Grove, and rode thrughe oure meyny, in and out agayn, and smote doun many fotemen.  and \u00feen, many of oure horsemen, seyng this, fledde to \u00fee Castell of Balyngham; but the Lord Camoys and \u00fees ij knyghtes kept \u00fee feld; And as God wold, the fote-mene relevid ageyn to \u00fee standart, And, \u00fee horse-men also, And sett frely on \u00fee Pikardes, and hem discomfyt, and slowe many of hem, and drof hem to the gates of Arde, where-as one Lucas, a squyer, folowet hens within theire barreers, and was slayn; for whome was made much mone.  And \u00feus,\u2014thonket be God!\u2014\u00fee Lord Camoys had \u00fee victory of his enmys, \u00fee Pikardes, in a feld callet \u00fee Golden Dale, besidde \u00fee Castell of Balyngham, And come to Caleys, with \u00feeir pray. \u00b6 Onon after, the Duke of Burgoyn, Phelipe, was redy, and come doune to Gravenyng with his ordynaunce, and Flemmynges, \u00fee nombre of an CL M l , and xij M l cartes; and ich cart had his cokke to crawe amonges the host.  \u00b6 Then \u00feai made a brigge ouer \u00fee water of Gravenyng, into a place callet \u00fee Hoke, \u00feat was partenyng to \u00fee saide Duyke.  And so come \u00feey ouer, and shewet hem before \u00fee Castell of Oye, and sent to Nicolas Horton, squier, and Capteyn of \u00fee same Castell, an heraude, chargyng hym to delyuer vp \u00fee Castell.  And he sent hym worde agayn, and said he toke hym non to kepe; nor non he wold delyuer:  Neuer\u00feeles, afterward, by a fals trety, \u00feai had hym out of \u00fee Castell to come speke with \u00fee Duyk.  And in \u00fee mene while \u00fee Castell was wonnen by a grate of Iron, \u00feat was lafte open in \u00fee buttery, where-as a gune lay whiles \u00fee saudiers were in \u00fee hall aboven, tretyng of a poyntement with an heraud of \u00fee said Duykes; And sodeynly \u00fee Flemmynges come in, and toke hem in \u00fee hall, and\n  hanget lvj on \u00fee gallows vnder \u00fee Castell, without eny pite, And slowe al \u00fee remenaunt, except Nicolas Horton, Capiteyn of \u00fee said Castell, and one William Bullion, Constable, And William Bullion, his cosyn:  thes iij were prisoners, but Nicolas Horton \u00fee Capteyn was long afterward raunsonet, and come home in-to Englond; And \u00fee Constable dyet in prison for sorowe; And his cosyn William Bullyon was so beknowe and welebelouet with \u00fee Pikardes, \u00feat thay gave hym his raunson, and lete hym go where he wold, so \u00feat he shuld go to Caleys, and espy when \u00fee Duyk of Gloucester shuld come ouer with his Navey from Sandewich, And sende hem worde.  \u00b6 When this William Bullyon come to Caleis, \u00fee pepill had gret mervaile \u00feat he was letton go without paying of eny rownson; wherfore Edmond, Erle of Morteyn, made to arest hym, and put hym in prison, and bare hym on hond \u00feat he was a spy.

And then \u00feei of Gaunt onon made a strong bulwerk on an high hill of \u00fee downe, of pipis & tymber, betweene \u00feaire loggynges and \u00fee toun, and shott gunnes in-to \u00fee toun; and many tymes \u00feai shot al ouer \u00fee toun; but al \u00feeire gunshot did neuer harm, thanket be God and \u00fee Holy Virgyn Saint Barbara!  \u00b6 In \u00fee mene whiles, whil \u00fee Duyke lay att seege at Caleis, with \u00fee Flemmynges, Sir Robert Savois, knyght, with iiij M l Picardes, come before \u00fee Castell of Balyngham.

And when Richard Sellyng come \u00feus to Guysnes with his feleshippe, William Picton, Leotenaunt of Guysnes vnder Humfrey, Duyke of Gloucester, putte hym in prison in \u00fee said Castell of Guysnes.  And when \u00fee Picardes had \u00feis Castell, \u00fee[i] spoilet it, and brake of \u00fee lede, and brant al \u00fee place, and vndermynet \u00fee walles and toures, and lete hem fall in \u00fee dike, as the Flemmynges hade done with \u00fee Castelles of Oye and Mark.  \u00b6 Then \u00fee Picardes come before \u00fee Castell of Guysnes, and laide seege \u00feerto, and\n  broughte with hem a gret brasen gune of Dogeon, with iij chambers, and ij othir grete gunnes of Iron callet bumbardes; and \u00feaye laide \u00fee brasen gune in A seller of \u00fee toune of Guysnes, on \u00fee dikeside of \u00fee Castell, and shotte att a ward next a toure callet \u00fee Faanetoure, and brake it doune in-to \u00fee dike.  but William Picton, Leotenaunt of \u00fee Castell, with his felesshipe with-in, full manfully and discretely hym gidet, and it fortifiet ageyn with tymber and dong.  \u00b6 And in this while, ano\u00feer meyny of Picardes come before \u00fee Castell of Sandgate, and bade hem deliuer vp \u00fee Castell for \u00feai said all o\u00feer Castelles were gyven ouer.
