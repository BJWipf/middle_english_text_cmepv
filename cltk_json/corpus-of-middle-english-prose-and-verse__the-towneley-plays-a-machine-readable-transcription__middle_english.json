Thar thou nowther flyte ne chyde, if thou tend right thou gettis thi mede; And be thou sekir, if thou teynd fals, thou bese alowed ther after als. Cain Whi, who is that hob-ouer-the-wall? we! who was that that piped so small? Com go we hens, for perels all; God is out of hys wit. Com furth, abell, & let vs weynd; Me thynk that god is not my freynd, on land then will I flyt. Abel A, Caym, brother, that is ill done. Cain No, bot go we hens sone; And if I may, I shall be ther as god shall not me see. Abel Dere brother, I will fayre on feld ther oure bestis ar, To looke if thay be holgh or full.

And sothly, if it so befall, Godys son that she be with all, If sich grace myght betyde, I wote well that I am not he, which that is worthi to be That blyssed, body besyde, Nor yit to be in company; To wyldernes I will for thi Enfors me for to fare; And neuer longer with hir dele, Bot stylly shall I from hir stele, That mete shall we no mare.

Secundus Magister whens euer this barne may be That shewys thise novels new? Jesus Certan, syrs, I was or ye, And shall be after you. Primus Magister Son, of thi sawes, as we haue ceyll, And of thi wytt is wonder thyng; Bot neuer the les fully I feyll That it may fayll in wyrkyng; ffor dauid demys euer ilk deyll, And thus he says of chylder ying, \"[Ex ore infanicium & lactencium, perfecisti laudem.\"] Of thare mowthes, sayth dauid, wele, Oure lord he has perfourmed louyng.

Jesus ye nede none othere bookys to bryng, Bot fownd this to fulfyll; The seconde may men profe And clergy knaw therby; youre neyghburs shall ye lofe Right as youre self truly. [Thise] commaunded moyses tyll all men In his commaundes clere; In thise two bydyngys, shall ye ken, hyngys all the law we aght to lere. who so fulfylles thise two then with mayn and mode and good manere, he fulfyllys truly all ten That after thaym folows in fere. Then shuld we god honowre with all oure myght and mayn, And luf well ilk neghboure Right as oure self certayn. Primus Magister Now, son, synthen thou has told vs two, which ar the aght, can thou oght say? Jesus The thyrd bydys, \"[where so ye go, That ye shall halow the holy day; ffrom bodely wark ye take youre rest; youre household, looke the same thay do, Both wyfe, chyld, seruande, and beest.\"] The fourt is then in weyll and wo \"[Thi fader, thi moder, thou shall honowre, Not only with thi reuerence, Bot in thare nede thou thaym socoure, And kepe ay good obedyence.\"] The fyft bydys the \"[no man slo, Ne harme hym neuer in word ne dede, Ne suffre hym not to be in wo If thou may help hym in his nede.\"] The sext bydys the \"[thi wyfe to take, Bot none othere lawfully; lust of lechery thou fle and fast forsake, And drede ay god where so thou be.\"] The seuen bydys the \"[be no thefe feyr, Ne nothyng wyn with trechery; Oker, ne symony, thou com not nere, Bot conscyence clere ay kepe truly.\"] The aght byddys the \"[be true in dede, And fals wytnes looke thou none bere; looke thou not ly for freynd ne syb, lest to thi saull that it do dere.\"] The neyn byddys the \"[not desyre Thi neghburs wyfe ne his women, Bot as holy kyrk wold it were, Right so thi purpose sett it in.\"] The ten byddys the \"[for nothyng Thi neghburs goodys yerne wrongwysly; his house, his rent, ne his hafyng, And crysten fayth trow stedfastly.\"] Thus in tabyls, shall ye ken, Oure lord to moyses wrate; Thise ar the commaundmentys ten, who so will lely layt.

Judas Not els bot if ye will hym by; do say me sadly or I gang. Cayphas yis, freynd, in fathe will we noght els; bot hartely say how that bargan may be, and we shall make the pay. Annas Iudas, forto hold the hayll, And for to fell all fowll defame, looke that thou may avow thi sayll; then may thou be withoutten blame. Judas Sir, of my teyn gyf ye neuer tayll, so that ye haue hym here at hame; his bowrdyng has me broght in bayll, and certys his self shall haue the same. Cayphas Sir pylate, tentys here tyll, and lightly leyf it noght, Then may ye do youre wyll of hym that ye haue boght. Annas yei, and then may we be bold fro all the folk to hald hym fre; And hald hym hard with vs in hold, right as oone of youre meneye. Pilate Now, Iudas, sen he shalbe sold, how lowfes thou hym? belyfe let se. Judas ffor thretty pennys truly told,, or els may not that bargan be; So mych gart he me lose, malycyusly and yll; Therfor ye shall haue chose, to by or let be styll. Annas Gart he the lose? I pray the, why? tell vs now pertly or thou pas. Judas I shall you say, and that in hy, euery word right as it was. In symon house with hym sat I with othere meneyoe that he has; A woman cam to company, callyng hym \"[lord\"]; saying, \"[alas!\"] ffor synnes that she had wroght she wepyd sore always; And an oyntment she broght, that precyus was to prayse. She weshyd hym with hir terys weytt, and sen dryed hym with hir hare; This fare oyntment, hir bale to beytt, apon his hede she put it thare, That it ran all abowte his feytt; I thoght it was a ferly fare, The house was full of odowre sweytt; then to speke myght I not spare, ffor certys, I had not seyn none oyntment half so fyne; Ther-at my hart had teyn, sich tresoure for to tyne.

The tent parte, truly to tell, to take to me was myne intent; ffor of the tresure that to vs fell, the tent parte euer with me went; And if thre hundreth be right told, the tent parte is euen thryrty; Right so he shalbe sold,; say if ye will hym by.

Annas Sir, all thyn askyng euery dele here shall thou hafe, therof be trast; Bot looke that we no falshede fele. Judas sir, with a profe may ye frast; All that I haue here hight I shall fulfill in dede, And well more at my myght, In tyme when I se nede. Pilate Iudas, this spekyng must be spar, and neuen it neuer, nyght ne day; let no man wyt where that we war, for ferdnes of a fowll enfray.

My godhede here I hyd In mary, moder myne, where it shall neuer by kyd to the ne none of thyne. Sathanas how now? this wold I were told, in towne; thou says god is thi syre; I shall the prove by good reson thou moyttys as man dos into myre. To breke thi byddyng they were full bowne, And soyn they wroght at my desyre; ffrom paradise thou putt theym downe, In hell here to haue thare hyre; And thou thy self, by day and nyght, taght euer all men emang, Euer to do reson and right, And here thou wyrkys all wrang. Jesus I wyrk no wrang, that shall thou wytt, if I my men fro wo will wyn; My prophetys playnly prechyd it, All the noytys that I begyn; They saide that I shuld be that ilke In hell where I shuld intre in, To saue my seruandys fro that pytt where dampnyd saullys shall syt for syn. And ilke true prophete tayll shalbe fulfillid, in me; I haue thaym boght fro bayll, in blis now shall they be. Sathanas Now sen thou lyst to legge the lawes, thou shalbe tenyd or we twyn, ffor those that thou to witnes drawes ffull euen agans the shall begyn; As salamon saide in his sawes, who that ones commys hell within he shall neuer owte, as clerkys knawes, therfor, belamy, let be thy dyn. Iob thi seruande also In his tyme can tell That nawder freynde nor fo shall fynde relese in hell. Jesus he sayde full soyth, that shall thou se, In hell shalbe no relese, Bot of that place then ment he where synfull care shall euer encrese. In that bayll ay shall thou be, where sorowes seyr shall neuer sesse, And my folke that were most fre shall pas vnto the place of peasse; ffor they were here with my will, And so thay shall furth weynde; Thou shall thiself fulfyll euer wo withoutten ende. Sathanas Whi, and will thou take theym all me fro? then thynk me thou art vnkynde; Nay, I pray the do not so; Vmthynke the better in thy mynde; Or els let me with the go, I pray the leyffe me not behynde! Jesus Nay, tratur, thou shall won in wo, and till a stake I shall the bynde. Sathanas Now here I how thou menys emang, with mesure and malyce forto mell; Bot sen thou says it shalbe lang, yit som let all-wayes with vs dwell. Jesus Yis, wytt thou well, els were greatt wrang; thou shall haue caym that slo abell, And all that hastys theym self to hang, As dyd Iudas and architophell; And daton and abaron / and all of thare assent, Cursyd tyranttys euer ilkon / that me and myn tormente. And all that will not lere my law, That I haue left in land, for new, That makys my commyng knaw, And all my sacramentys persew; My deth, my rysyng, red by raw, Who trow thaym not thay ar vntrewe; vnto my dome I shall theym draw, And Iuge theym wars then and Iew. And thay that lyst to lere / my law, and lyf therby, Shall neuer haue harmes here, / bot welth as is worthy. Sathanas Now here my hand, I hold, me payde, thise poyntys ar playnly for my prow; If this be trew that thou has saide, we shall haue mo then we haue now; Thies lawes that thou has late here laide, I shall theym lere not to alow; If thay myn take thay ar betraide, and I shall turne theym tytt I trow. I shall walk eest, I shall walk west, and gar theym wyrk well war. Jesus Nay feynde, thou shalbe feste, that thou shall flyt no far. Sathanas ffeste? fy! that were a wykyd treson! belamy, thou shalbe smytt. Jesus Devill, I commaunde the to go downe into thi sete where thou shall syt. Sathanas Alas, for doyll and care!

Moyses Dauid, thi prophete trew, oft tymes told, vnto vs, Of thi commyng he knew, and saide it shuld, be thus. David As I saide ere yit say I so, \"[ne derelinquas, domine, Animam meam in inferno;\"] \"[leyfe neuer my saull, lord, after the, In depe hell wheder dampned, shall go; suffre thou neuer thi sayntys to se The sorow of thaym that won in wo, ay full of fylth, and may not fle.\"] Moyses Make myrth both more and les, and loue oure lord we may, That has broght vs fro bytternes In blys to abyde for ay.

Centurion A, blyssyd lord adonay, what may this meruell sygnyfy That here was shewyd so openly vnto oure sight, When the rightwys man can dy that ihesus hight? heuen it shoke abone, Of shynyng blan both son and moyne, And dede men also rose vp sone, Outt of thare grafe; And stones in wall anone In sonder brast and clafe.

Cleophas was neuer man in no-kyns steede That suffred half so greatt mysdede As he, to ded or that he yede, Ne yit the care; ffor-thi full carefull is my red where soeuer I fare. Lucas where so I fare he is my mynde, Bot when I thynk on hym so kynde, how sore gyltles that he was pyynde Apon a tre, Vnethes may I hold, my mynde, So sore myslykys me. Jesus Pylgrymes, whi make ye this mone, And walk so rufully by the way? haue ye youre gates vngrathly gone? Or what you alys to me ye say. what wordes ar you two emange, That ye here so sadly gang? To here theym eft full sore I lang, here of yow two; It semys ye ar in sorow strang, here as ye go. Cleophas what way, for shame, man, has thou tayn That thou wote not of this affray? Thow art a man by the alane, Thow may not pleasse me to my pay. Jesus I pray you, if it be youre will, Those Wordys ye wold, reherse me tyll; ye ar all heuy and lykys yll here in this way; If ye will now shew me youre [wyll] I wold you pray. Lucas Art thou a pilgreme thi self alone, walkand in contry bi thyn oone, And wote not what is commen and gone within few dayes? Me thynk thou shuld make mone, And wepe here in thi wayes. Jesus whi, what is done can ye me say In this land this ylk day? Is ther fallen any affray In land awre whare? If ye can, me tell I you pray, Or that I farthere fare. Cleophas why, knowys thou not what thyng is done here at Ierusalem thus sone, Thrugh wykyd Iues, withoutten hone, And noght lang syn? flor the trewe prophete make we this mone, And for his pyne. Lucas yee for ihesu of nazarene, That was a prophete true and clene, In word, in wark, full meke, I wene, And that fonde we; And so has he full long bene, As mot I the, To god and to the people bath; Therfor thise daies he has takyn skath, Vnto the ded, withoutten hagh, Thise Iues hym dight; ffor-thi for hym thus walk we wrath By day and nyght. Cleophas Thise wykyd Iues trayed hym with gyle To thare high preestys within a whyle, And to thare prynces thay can hym fyle, withoutten drede; Apon a crosse, noght hens a myle, To ded he yede. Lucas we trowyd that it was he truly his awne lyfe agane shuld by, As it is told in prophecy Of Cristys doyng; And, certys, thay will neuer ly ffor noykyns thyng. ffro he was of the crosse tayn he was layde full sone agane In a graue, vnder a stane, And that we saw; wheder he be rysen and gane yit we ne knaw. Jesus Pilgremes, in speche ye are full awth, That shall I well declare you why, ye haue it hart, and that is rawth, ye can no better stand therby, Thyng that ye here; And prophetys told it openly On good manere. Thay saide a childe there shuld be borne To by mankynde combryd in care; Thus saide dauid here beforne And othere prophetys wyse of lare, And daniell; Som saide he ded shuld be, And ly in erth by dayes thre, And sithen, thrugh his pauste, Ryse vp in flesh and fell. Cleophas Now, sir, for sothe, as god me saue, women has flayed vs in oure thoght; Thay saide that thay were at his graue, And in that sted, thay faunde hym noght, Bot saide a light Com downe with angels, and vp hym broght Ther in thare sight. we wold not trow theym for nothyng, If thay were ther in the mornyng, we saide thay knew not his rysyng when it shuld be; Bot som of vs, without dwellyng, wentt theder to se. Lucas yee, som of vs, sir, haue beyn thare, And faunde it as the women saide, Out of that sted that cors was fare, And also the graue stone put besyde, we se with ee; The teres outt of myn ees can glyde, ffor doyll I dre. Jesus ye foyles, ye ar not stabyll! where is youre witt, I say? wilsom of hart ye ar vnabyll And outt of the right way, ffor to trow it is no fabyll that at is fallen this same day. he wyst, when he sat at his tabill, that Iudas shuld, hym sone betray. Me thynk you all vntrist to trow, both in mode and mayn, All that the prophetys told to you before, it is no trane. Told, not thay what wyse and how That cryst shuld suffre payn? And so to his paske bow To entre till his ioy agane. Take tent to moyses and othere mo, that were prophetys trew and good; Thay saide ihesus to ded, shuld go, And pynde be on roode; Thrugh the Iues he maide full blo, his woundys rynyng on red blode; Sithen shuld he ryse and furth go before, right as he yode. Crist behovid to suffre this, fforsothe, right as I say, And sithen enter into his blys vnto his fader for ay, Euer to won with hym and his, where euer is gam and play; Of that myrth shall he neuer mys ffro he weynde hens away. Cleophas Now, sir, we thank it full oft sythes, the commyng of you heder; To vs so kyndly kythes the prophecy all to geder. Jesus By leyff now, sirs, for I must weynde, ffor I haue far of my iornay. Lucas Now, sir, we pray you, as oure freynde, All nyght to abyde for charite, And take youre r[est]; At morne more prest then may ye be to go full prest. Cleophas Sir, we you pray, for godys sake, This nyght penance with vs to take, With sich chere as we can make, And that we pray; we may no farthere walk ne wake, Gone is the day. Lucas Dwell with vs, sir, if ye myght, ffor now it waxes to the nyght, The day is gone that was so bright, No far thou shall; Mete and drynk, sir, we you hight ffor thi good tale. Jesus I thank you both, for sothe, in fere, At this tyme I ne may dwell here, I haue to walk in wayes sere, where I haue hight; I may not be, withoutten were, With you all nyght. Cleophas Now, as myght I lyf in qwarte, At this tyme will we not parte, Bot if that thou can more of arte Or yit of lare; Vnto this cyte, with good harte, Now let vs fare. Lucas Thou art a pilgreme, as we ar, This nyght shall thou fare as we fare, Be it les or be it mare Thou shall assay; Then to-morne thou make the yare To weynde thi Way. Jesus ffreyndys, forto fulfill youre will I will abyde with you awhyle. Cleophas Sir, ye ar welcom, as is skyll, To sich as we haue, bi sant gyle. Lucas Now ar we here at this towne, I red that we go sytt vs downe, And forto sowpe we make vs bowne, Now of oure fode; we haue enogh, sir, bi my crowne, Of godys goode. Cleophas lo, here a borde and clothe laide, And breed, theron, all redy graide; Sit we downe, we shalbe paide, And make good chere; It is but penaunce, as we saide, That we haue here. Lucas wemmow! where is this man becom, Right here that sat betwix vs two? he brake the breed and laide vs som; how myght he hens now fro vs go At his awne lyst? It was oure lorde, I trow right so, And we not wyst. Cleophas When went he hens, whedir, and how, What I ne wote in warld so wyde, ffor had I wyten, I make a vowe, he shuld haue byden, what so betyde; Bot it were ihesus that with vs was, Selcowth me thynke, the sothe to say, Thus preualy from vs to pas, I wist neuer when he went away. we were full blynde, euer alas! I tell vs now begylde for ay, ffor spech and bewte that he has Man myght hym knaw this day. Lucas A, dere god, what may this be? Right now was he here by me; Now is this greatt vanyte, he is away; We ar begylyd, by my lewte, So may we say. Cleophas where was oure hart, where was oure thoght, So far on gate as he vs broght, knawlege of hym that we had noght In all that tyme? So was he lyke, bi hym me wroght, Till oon pylgryme. Lucas Dere god, why couth we hym not knawe? so openly all on a raw The tayles that he can till vs shaw, By oone and oon; And now from vs within a thraw Thus sone is gone. Cleophas I had no knawlege it was he, Bot for he brake this brede in thre, And delt it here to the and me With his awne hande; When he passyd, hence we myght not se, here syttande. Lucas Wee ar to blame, yee, veramente, That we toke no better tente whils we bi the way wente With hym that stownd,; knowlege of hym we myght haue hentt, Syttyng on grownd,. Cleophas ffro he toke breede full well I wyst, And brake it here with his awne fyste, And laide it vs at his awne lyst, As we it hent; I knew hym then, and sone it kyst with good, intente. Lucas That we hym knew wist he well enogh, Therfor all sone he hym with-drogh, ffro he saw that we hym knogh, with in this sted; I haue ferly what way and how Away that he shuld glyde. Cleophas Alas, we war full myrk in thoght, bot we were both full will of red,; Man, for shame whi held, thou noght when he on borde brake vs this breede? he soght the prophecy more and les And told it vs right in this sted,, how that he hym self was With wykid Iues broght to ded,, And more; we will go seke that kyng That suffred woundes sore. Lucas Ryse, go we hence from this place, To Ierusalem take we the pace, And tell oure brethere all the case, I red right thus; ffrom ded, to lyfe when that he rase he apperyd till vs. Cleophas At Ierusalem I vnderstande, Ther hope I that they be dwelland, In that countre and in that land We shall theym mete. Weynd we furth, I dar warand,, Right in the strete. Lucas let vs not tary ne mare, Bot on oure feete fast lett vs fare; I hope we shall be cachid fro care ffull sone, Iwys; That blyssid childe that marie bare Grauntt you his blys.", "27": "Thomas of India Maria Magdalene Hayll brethere! and god be here! I bryng to amende youre chere, Trist ye it and knawe; he is rysen, the soth to say, I met hym goyng bi the way, he bad me tell it you. Peter Do way, woman, thou carpys wast! It is som spirite, or els som gast; Othere was it noght; we may trow on nokyns wyse That ded man may to lyfe ryse; This then is oure thoght. Paul It may be sothe for mans mede, The Iues maide hym grymly blede Thrugh feet, handys, and syde; With nayles on rode thay dyd hym hang, wherfor, woman, thou says wrang, As myght I blys abide. Maria Magdalene Do way youre threpyng! ar ye wode? I sagh hym that dyed on roode, And with hym spake with mowth; Therfor you both, red I, putt away your heresy, Tryst it stedfast and cowth. Peter Do way, woman! let be thi fare, ffor shame and also syn! If we make neuer sich care his lyfe may we not wyn. Paul And it is wretyn in oure law `Ther is no trust in womans saw, No trust faith to belefe; ffor with thare quayntyse and thare gyle Can thay laghe and wepe som while, And yit nothyng theym grefe.' In oure bookes thus fynde we wretyn, All manere of men well it wyttyn, Of women on this wyse; Till an appyll she is lyke- Withoutten faill ther is none slyke- In horde ther it lyse, Bot if a man assay it wittely, It is full roten inwardly At the colke within; Wherfor in woman is no laghe, ffor she is withoutten aghe, As crist me lowse of syn. Thefor trast we not trystely, Bot if we sagh it witterly Then wold we trastly trow; In womans saw affy we noght, ffor thay ar fekill in word and thoght, This make I myne avowe. Maria Magdalene As be I lowsid of my care, It is as trew as ye stand thare, By hym that is my brothere. Peter I dar lay my heede to wed, Or that we go vntill oure bed That we shall here anothere. Paul If it be sothe that we here say, Or this be the thrid day The sothe then mon we se. Maria Magdalene Bot it be sothe to trow, As ye mon here, els pray I you ffor fals that ye hold me.

Tercius Apostolus Thou wote, thomas / and sothe it was, and oft has thou hard say, how a fysh swalod, ionas / thre dayes therin he lay; yit gaf god hym myght to pas / whyk man to wyn away; Myght not god sich myght has / rase his son apon the thryd day? Thomas Man, if thou can vnderstand / cryst saide his self, mynnys me, That all lokyn was in his hande / all oone was god and he! The son wax marke, all men seand / when he died, on the tre, Therfor am I full sore dredand, / that who myght his boote be. Quartus Apostolus the holy gost in marye light / and in hir madynhede Goddis son she held, and dight / and cled hym in manhede; ffor luf he wentt as he had hight / to fight withoutten drede; when he had termynd that fight / he skypt outt of his wede. Thomas If he skypt outt of his clethyng / yit thou grauntys his cors was ded,; It was his cors that maide shewyng / vnto you in his sted; fforto trow in youre carpyng / my hart is hevy as led; his dede me bryngys in great mowrneyng / and I withoutten red. Quintus Apostolus The gost went to hell a pase / whils the cors lay slayn, And broght the sawles from sathanas / for which he suffred, payn; The thryd day right he gase / right vnto the cors agayn, Mighty god and man he rase / and therfor ar we fayn. Thomas All sam to me ye flyte / youre resons fast ye shawe, Bot tell me a skyll perfyte / any of you on raw; when cryst cam you to vysyte / as ye tell me with saw, A whyk man from spyryte / wherby couth ye hym knaw?

Thomas Waloway! ye can no good / youre resons ar defaced, ye ar as women rad for blood, / and lightly oft solaced; It was a goost before you stod / lyke hym in blood betraced, his cors that dyed on rood / for euer hath deth embraced. Octavus Apostolus Certys, thomas, gretter care / myght no synfull wight haue Then she had, that wepyd so sare / the mawdleyn at his graue; ffor sorow and doyll hir awne hare / of hir hede she rent and rafe, Ihesu shewid hym till hir thare / hir sorow of syn to safe.

In all youre skylles more and les / for mysfowndyng fayll ye; Might I se ihesu gost and flesh / gropyng shuld not gab me. Novenus Apostolus lefe thomas, flyte no more / bot trow and turne thi red, Or els say vs when and whore / crist gabbyd in any sted; ffor he saide vs when thou was thore / when he hym gaf in bred,, That he shuld, salfe all oure sore / quyk rysand fro ded,.

Thomas Nothyng that ye may neuen / his rysyng gars me weyn, If ye me told, sich seuen / the more ye myght me teyn. Paul Thomas, brothere, turne thi thoght / and trust that I say the; Ihesu so dere has boght / oure synnes apon a tree, which rysyng hath broght / adam and his meneyee.

Tercius Apostolus That must thou nedelyngys trow / if thou thi saull will saue, ffor that we sa we dar avowe / ihesu rose quyk from graue. Thomas I haue you saide, and yit dos now / thise wordes to wast ye haue; he shewid hym not to you / for mysfoundyng ye rafe. Quartus Apostolus ffor we say that we haue sene / thou hold,ys vs wars then woode; Ihesu lyfyng stod vs betwene / oure lord that with vs yode. Thomas I say ye wote neuer what ye mene / a goost before you stode; ye wenyd that it had bene / the cors that died on roode. Quintus Apostolus The cors that dyed on tre / was berid in a stone, The thurgh beside fande we / and in that graue cors was none; his sudary ther myght we se / and he thens whik was gone. Thomas Noght, bot stolne is he / with Iues that hym haue slone. Sextus Apostolus Certys, thomas, thou sais not right / thay wold, hym not stele, ffor thay gart kepe hym day and nyght / with knyghtys that they  held lele; he rose has we haue sene in sight / fro all the Iues fele. Thomas I lefe not bot if I myght / myself with hym dele. Septimus Apostolus He told vs tythyngys, thomas / yit mynnys me, That as Ionas thre dayes was / In a fysh in the see, so shuld he be, and bene has / in erth by dayes thre, pas fro ded, ryse, and rase / as he saide done has he. Thomas Certys, that worde I harde hym say / and so harde ye hym all, Bot for nothyng trow I may / that it so shuld befall, That he shuld ryse the thrid day / that dranke asell and gall: sen he was god and ded lay / from ded, who myght hym call? Octavus Apostolus The fader that hym sent / rasid hym that was ded, he comforth vs in mowrnyng lent / and counseld vs in red; he bad vs trow with good intent / his rysyng in euery sted; Thyne absens gars thi saull be shent / and makys the heuy as led. Thomas Thou says soth, harde and heuy / am I to traw that ye me say; Mi hardnes I trow skilfully / for he told vs thus ay, That his fader was euer hym by / for all bot oon were thay; That he rose bodely / for nothyng trow I may. Novenus Apostolus May thou not trow withoutten mo / for sothe, that it was he? Thomas wherto shuld we say so? / then wenys thou fals we be. Thomas I wote youre hartes was full wo / and fownd with vanyte; If ye swere all and ye were mo / I trow it not or that I se. Decimus Apostolus Thomas, of errowre thou blyn / and till vs turne thi mode; Trow his rysyng by dayes threyn / sen he died on the rode.
