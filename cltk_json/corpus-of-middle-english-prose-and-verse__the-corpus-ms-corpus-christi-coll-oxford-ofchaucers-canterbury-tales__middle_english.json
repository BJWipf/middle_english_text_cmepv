Right so deliteth the fende in this ordure / [852] this is that other honde of the Deuel / with .v. fyngeres to that kaccheth the peple to his vilonye / [853] The first fynger is the fool lokyng of

fynger is the vileynes touchinge in wikked manere / and therfore seith Salomon / that who so \u00b6 Salomon. toucheth & handelith a woman / he farith I-like him that handelith the Scorpion that stingeth & sodenly sleth / thorugh his envenymynge / And who so toucheth warme picche / hit fouleth his fyngers / [855] The .iij. fynger is foule wordes that farith like fire that anoon brenneth the

than is she as it were his suster / [862] The .v. fynger of the deuels honde is the stingkyng dede of lecherie / [863] Certes the .v. fyngers of glotenye the fende putteth in the wombe of a man / And with the .v. fyngers of lecherie he gripeth him bi the reynes for to throwe him in to the furneys of helle / [864] there as thei shul haue the fire & the wormes that euere shal laste / & wepinge / &

fornicacion that is bitwix man & woman / that ben nat maried / & this is dedly sinne & ayeines nature / [866] Al that is enemy & distruccion to nature / is ayeines nature / [867] Perfay the reson of a man tellith him wel that it is dedly synne / for-asmeche as god forbade lecherie / And seynt Paule seith / yeueth him the regne that is due to no wight \u00b6 Paule. but to hem that don dedly synne / [868] Another synne of lecherie is / to bireven a maiden of hir maidenhede / ffor certis he that so dothe / he taketh a maiden out of the highest degre that is in this present liff / [869] & birevith hir thilke precious fruyte / that the booke clepeth the hundrede fruyte / I can nat seie it / in noon other wise in englissh / but in latyn hit hight / Centes[i]mus fructus / \u00b6 Centes[i]mus fructus. [870] Certes he that so dothe / is cause of many damages & vilonyes mo than any man can reken / Right as he somtyme is cause of al the damages that bestes don in the felde / that breken the hegges or the clausure / thorugh whiche he distroyeth that may nat be restorede / [871] ffor certis no more may maidenhede be re|stored / than an arme that is smeten from the body / may retorne ayeine to wexe / [872] she may haue mercy this woote I wel / if she do penaunce / but neuere shal hit be / that she nas corrupte / [873] And al be it so that I haue spoken somwhat of advoutrie / it is goode to shewen mo perilles that longen to aduoutrie / ffor to eschewe the foule synne of [874] aduoutrie / in latyn it is for to seie / approching of other menis wivis / thorugh whiche tho that whilom were first oo flesshe / abunden here bodies to other persones / [875] Off this synne / as seith the wise man / folowen many harmes / ffirst brekyng of feith / & certis in the feith is the keye of cristendom / [876] & whan that feith is broke & lorne / certis cristendom stondith in vayne & withouten fruyte / [877] this sinne is eke a theffte / for theffte generally is / to reve a wighte his thinge ayeines his wille / [878] Certes this is the fouleste thefft that may be / whan a woman stelith hir body from hir housbond / & yivith hit to hir holour to defoule hir / & stelith hir soule from criste / & yivith hit to the deuel / [879] this is a fouler thefft than forto breke a chirche & stele the chaleys / ffor these aduoutres breken the temple of god spiritually / & stelen the vessel of grace / that is the body & the soule / ffor whiche criste shal distroien hem as seith seint Poule / [880] sothely \u00b6 Poule. of this thefft dovted gretely Ioseph / whan that his lordis wiff praide him of vilonye / whan he seide lo my ladi how my lorde hath taken to me vnder my warde al that he hath in this worlde / ne nothing of his thinges is out of my power / but onely ye that ben his wiff / [881] and how sholde I than do this wikkednes / & synne so orrible ayeines god / & ayeines my lorde / god hit forbede / Allas al to litel is suche trouth now I-founde / [882] The thridde harme is the filthe thorugh whiche thei breken the commaundement of god / & defoulen the auctor of here matrymoigne that is criste / [883] ffor certis in-so-meche that the sacrament of mariage is so noble / & so digne / so meche hit is the gretter synne to breke hit / ffor god made mariage in Paradise in the state of Innocence / to multiplie mankynde to the seruice of god / [884] & therfore is the brekyng therof the more greuous / of whiche breking cometh fals heires ofte tyme / that wrongefully occupien other menis heritage / & therfore wol criste put hem out of the regne of heuen / that is heritage to goode folke / [885] Of this brekyng cometh oftyn tyme / that folke vnwar wedden or synnen / with here owne kynrede / & namely thilke harlottes that haunten bordels / of these foole wemmen that mowe be likened to a comune gouge / where as men purgen there ordure / [886] what seie we eke of poytours that leven bi the horrible synne of putrie & constreinen wommen to yelde hem a certeyne rente of here bodily putrie / y somtyme of his owne wiff / or his childe / as don these baudes / Certes these ben cursed synnes / [887] Vnderstondith eke that advoutrie is sette gladly in the ten commaundementes / bituexe theffte & man|slaughter / ffor it is the grettest theffte that may be / ffor it is the theffte of body & of soule / [888] & hit is like homycide / for it kerveth a-two & breketh a-two hem that first were made Oo flesshe / & therefore bi the olde lawe of god / thei sholde be sleyne / [889] But natheles bi the lawe of ihesu criste that is the lawe of pite / whan he seide to the womman that was founden in advoutrie / & sholde haue ben sleyne with stones / after the wil of the Iewes / as was there lawe / Go quod ihesu criste & haue no more wille to synne / or willen to do no more no synne / [890] sothely the vengeaunce of advoutrie is awarded to the peyne of helle / but if it be distorbled bi penaunce / [891] yit ben ther mo spicis of this cursed synne / as whan that oon of hem is religious / or ellis both / or of folke that ben entred in-to order / as subdiacone / & deken / or preste / or hospitelers / & euer the higher that he is in order / the gretter is the synne / [892] The thinges that gretly agregen here synne / is the brekyng of here avowe / of chastite / that thei made whan thei resceivede order / [893] And forther ouere soth it is / that holy order is tresour cheff of god / & his especial signe & marke of chastite / to shewe that thei ben Ioyned to chastite / whiche that is the most precious liff that is / [894] And eke these ordred folke ben specially entitled to god / & of the special meyne of god / ffor whiche whan thei don dedly synne / thei ben the special traytours of god / & of his peple / ffor thei leven of the peple / to praie for the peple / And while they ben suche traitours / here praiers availen nat to the peple / [895] \u00b6 Prestes ben as Aungels / as bi the dignite of here misterie / but for sothe seint Poule \u00b6 Paulus. seith / that Sathanas transformeth him in an Aungel of light / [896] sothely the preste that haunteth dedly synne / he may be likened to the Angel of derkenesse / transformed / in the Angel of light / he semeth an Angel of light / & but for sothe he is an Angel of derkenesse / [897] suche prestes ben the sones of Belye as shewith in the boke of kynges / that thei weren the sones of Belial / that is the deuel / [898] Belyal is to seyne withouten Iugge And so faren thei / hem thenketh thei ben fre / & han no Iugge / no more than hath a fre Boole / that taketh whiche kow that him liketh in the towne / [899] Right so faren thei bi wommen / ffor right as a fre Boole is I-nough for al a toune / Right so is a wikked preste corrupt / I-nough for al a parissh / or for al a contre / [900] these prestes as seith the booke / ne conne nat the mynysterie of presthode to the pepel / ne god knowith hem nought / thei holde hem nat a-paide as seith the booke / of soden flessh that was to hem offred / but thei toke bi force the flessh that is rawe / [901] Certes right so these olde shrewis / ne holde hem nat a-paide of rosted flessh / & soden flessh / with the whiche the peple feden hem with grete reuerence / but thei wol haue rawe flessh / as men-is \u00b6 prestes wol haue rawe flesshe. wivis & here doughtren / [902] And certis these women that consenten to here harlotries / don grete wronges to criste / & to holy chirche / And to alle halowes / & to alle soules / ffor they bireven him alle these that sholden wourshipe criste / & holy chirche / & pray for alle cristen soules / [903] And therefore haue suche prestes & here lemmans eke that consenten to here lecherie / the malison of al cristen courte / til thei come to amendement / [904] The thride spice of advoutrie / is bitwene a man and his wiff / & that is whan thei take no rewarde in here assemblynge / but onely to here flesshly delite / as seith seint Ierome / [905] and rekken of nothinge but \u00b6 Ierome. that thei ben assembled / bi-cause that thei ben I-mariede al is good I-nough / as thenkith to hem / [906] but in suche folke the deuel hath power / as seide the Aungel Raphael to Tobye / ffor in al here assemblynge thei putten oute ihesu criste of here herte / & yeven hem selff to al ordoure / [907] The .iiij. spice of advoutrie is the assemblyng of hem that ben of here kynrede / or of them that ben of oon affinite / or ellis with hem with whiche hir fader or here kynrede hath deled in the synne of lecherie / this synne maketh hem I-like to houndes / that taken no kepe to kynrede / [908] And certis perentela is in two maners / outher gostly outher flesshly / gostly is to delen with here gossebes / [909] ffor right so as he that engendreth the childe is the flesshly fader / right so is his gossebe his spirituel fader / ffor whiche a woman may no lasse synne assemble with hir gosseb / than with hir owne flesshely brother / [910] The .v. spice is that abhomynable synne of whiche that no man vnnethes oughte to speke ne write / natheles hit is openly rehersed in holy writte / [911] this cursednes don men & women in diuers entente / & in diuers manere / but though that holy writte speke of orrible synne / certis holy writte may nat be defouled / no more than the sonne that shyneth on the mexen / [912] Another synne perteyneth vn-to lecherie / that cometh in sleping / & this synne cometh offte to hem that ben maydens / & eke to hem that ben corrupte / & this synne men clepen pollucion / that cometh in .iiij. maners / [913] somtyme of a languysshinge of body for the humours ben to ranke / & to habundaunte in the bodie of a man / Somtyme for the infirmite & for the feblenes of the vertu retentiff / as phisike maketh mension / Somtyme for surfete of mete & drinke / [914] And somtyme of violent thoughtes that ben enclosed in man-is mynde whan he gooth to slepe / whiche may nat be withouten synne / ffor the whiche men muste kepe hem wisely / or ellis thei may synne greuously \u00b6 The remedie ayeines lecherie [915] NOw cometh the remedie ayeinest lecherie / & that is generally chastite / & continence / that re|streyneth al the disordeine mevynge that cometh of flesshly talentes / [916] & euer the gretter merite shal we haue / that moste restreyneth the wikked enchau|fynges / or ordour of this synne / And this is in two maners / that is to seie chastite of mariage / & chastite of widewhode / [917] Now shalt thow vnderstonde that matrymonye is lefful assemblynge of man & of woman / that receiven bi vertu of sacrament / the bonde thorugh whiche thei may nat be departed in al there liff / that is to seyn whiles that thei leven bothe / [918] This is as seith the booke a ful gret sacrament / god made hit as I haue seide in Paradise / & wolde him selff be borne in mariage / [919] And for to halowen mariage / he was at a wedding / whereas he torned water vn-to wyne / whiche was the firste miracle that he wroughte here in erthe / bifore his disciples / [920] Trewe effecte of mariage clensith fornicacion / & replesshith holy chirche of good lynage / for that is the ende of mariage / & hit changith dedly synne / in-to venial synne / bitwex hem that ben wedded / & makith the hertes al oon / of hem /. . . no gap in the MS. as wel as the bodies / [921] this is verry mariage that was establis shed bi god or that synne bigan / whan naturel lawe / was in his right poynte in Paradise / And hit was ordeyned that oo man / sholde haue but oo woman / And oo woman sholde haue but oo man / as seith seint Austyne bi many resons / \u00b6 Austyne. [922] ffirst for that mariage is figured bitw[i]x god & holy chirche / And that other is / for that a man is the hede of the woman / algate bi ordinaunce hit sholde be so / [923] ffor if a woman had mo men than oon / than sholde she haue mo hedes than oon / & that were an orrible thing bifore god / And eke oo woman myghte nat please to many folke attones / And also there shulde neuere be pees ne reste / amonges hem / ffor eueryche wolde axe his owne thinge / [924] And ferther ouer no man shulde knowe his owne en|gendrure / ne who sholde haue his heritage / And the woman sholde be the lesse biloued fro the tyme that she were comune to many men / [925] Now cometh how that a man sholde bere him with his wiff / And namely in two thinges / that is to seie / in suffraunce & in reuerence / & that shewed criste whan he made first woman / [926] ffor he made hir nought of the hede of Adam / ffor she sholde nat cleyme to grete lordshippe / [927] ffor there as the woman hath the maistrie / she makith to meche disaray / there nedeth noon ensamples of this / thexperience day bi day oughte I-nough suffice / [928] Also certis god ne made nat woman of the foote of Adam / ffor she sholde nat be holden to lowe / ffor she can nat paciently suffre / but god made woman of the ribbe of Adam / ffor woman sholde be felowe vn-to man / [929] A man sholde bere him to his wiff / In feith / In trouthe / & in love / as seith seint Poule / that a man sholde love his wiff / As criste loueth \u00b6 Poule holy chirche / that loued hit so wel that he deyede for hit / so sholde a man for his wiff If hit were nede / [930] Now how that a woman sholde be subiecte to hir housbonde / that tellith seint Peter / ffirst in obedi|ence \u00b6 Petrus. / [931] and eke as seith the Decre / A woman as longe as she is a wiff / she hath noon auctorite to swere / ne to bere wittnesse / withoute leve of here housbondes / that is here lorde / algate he sholde be so bi reson / [932] She sholde eke serve him in al honeste / & ben attempre of hir array I woot wel that thei shulde sette al here entente to please here hous|bondes / but nat bi queyntise of here array / [933] seint Ierome seith that wives that ben apparelled in silke & \u00b6 Ierome. in precious purpul / ne mowen nat clothen hem in ihesu criste / Loke what seith seint Iohn eke in this matere \u00b6 Iohan.

[956] Now that I haue declared yow as I can the .vij. dedly synnes / & some of here braunches / & here remedies / sothely if I couthe I wolde telle yow the ten comaundementes [957] but so high a doctryne I lete to divines / but natheles I hope to god thei ben touched in this litil tretise eueryche of hem alle / De secunda parte penitencie. [958] NOw for-asmeche as the seconde partie of penaunce stonte in confession of mouthe / as I bigan in the chapitre / I seie seint Austyne seith / [959] synne is euery worde / & euery dede / & al that

whether thow be male or female / y[o]nge or olde / gentil or thral / fre or seruaunte / hoole or sike / wedded or sengle / ordred or vnordred / wise or foole / clerke or seculere / [962] if she be of thi kynrede bodily or gostly or non / if any of thi kynrede haue synned with hir or non / & many mo thinges / [963] That other circunstaunce is this / whether hit be \u00b6 Secunda don in fornicacion / or in aduoutrie or non / or in ceste or non / maiden or non / in manere of homicide or non / orrible grete synne or smale / & how longe thow hast contenued in synne / [964] The thride circunstaunce is \u00b6 tercia the place where as thow hast don synne / whether in other men-is hous or in thin owne / in felde or in chirche or in chirchehawe / in chirche dedicate or non / [965] ffor if the chirche be halowed / & a man or a woman spilt his kynde bi wey of synne with-inne that place / or bi wikked temptacion the chirche were enterdited / til it were reconsiled bi the busshoppe / [966] And if he were a preste that dide suche a vilonye / the terme of al his liff he shulde neuere singe masse / & if he dide / he shulde \u00b6 war ye prestes. do dedly synne at euery tyme that he songe masse

bere companye / wil go to the deuel of helle / [968] ffor they that eggen / or con|senten to the synne / ben partyners of the sinne / & of the dampnacion of the synne / [969] The .v. . . . .is how many tymes \u00b6 quinta. he hath synned / if it be in his mynde / & how offte that he hath falle / [970] ffor he that oft fallith in synne / dispisith the mercy of god / & encresith his synne / & is vnkynde to god / & he wexeth the more feble to withstonde synne / & synneth the more lightliere / [971] & the latter arisith / & is the more eschue to shriven him / & namely to him that hath be his

places / but sothely such departed shrifft deservith no mercy of god of his synnes / [973] The .vj. circun|staunce \u00b6 Sexta. is this / whi that a man synneth as bi temptacion / & if him selff procure that temptacion / or bi the ex|ityng of other folke / or if he synne with a woman bi force / or bi hir owne assente / [974] or if the woman mavgre hir hede hath be enforsed or noon / this shal she telle / ffor couetise or for pouerte / & if hit was hir procurynge or non / & suche manere harneys / [975] The .vij. circunstaunce is / in what \u00b6 Septima. manere he hath don his synne / & how that she hath suffred folke to don to hir / [976] & the same shal the man telle pleynly / al circunstaunces / & whether he hath synned with comune bordel women or non / [977] or don his synne in holy

his iugement / & in yevinge of thi penaunce / & that is after thi contricion / [980] ffor vnderstondeth wel / that after the tyme that a man hathe defouled his baptyme bi synne / if he wil come to saluacion / ther is noon other wey but bi penaunce & shrifft / & bi satisfaccion / [981] And namely bi tho two / if ther be a confessour to whiche he may shrive him / & the thridde if he may haue liff to performe hit / [982] than shal a man loke & considre / if he wol make a trewe & profitable confession / ther moste be .iiij. condiciones therinne / [983] ffirst hit most be in sorowful bitternes of herte / As seith the kyng Ezechiel To \u00b6 Ezechiel god I wol remembre me alle the dayes & yeres of my liff in bitternesse of myn herte / [984] This condicion of bitter|nesse hath .v. signes / The first is that confession mote be shamefaste / nat for to couere ne to hide his sinne / but for he hath agilt his god / & defouled his soule / [985] & here-of seith seint Austyne / the herte \u00b6 Austyne travaileth for shame of his synne / & for he hath grete shamefastnes / he is digne to haue grete mercye of god [986] Suche was the confession of the Puplicane that wolde nat heve vp his eighen to heuen / for he had offended god of heuen ffor whiche shamefastnes he had anoon the mercy of god / [987] And therfore seith seint Austyne / that suche shamefast folke / ben next for-yevenesse & remission / [988] That other signe is humylite of confession / of which seith seint Peter / \u00b6 Peter. humbleth yow vnder the myght of god / the honde of god is myghti in confession / ffor ther-bi god foryevith the thi synnes / for he alone hath the power / [989] & this humylite shal be in herte / & in signe outwarde / ffor right as he hath humilite to god in his herte / Right so sholde he humble his body outwarde to the preste that sitteth in godis place / [990] ffor whiche in no manere / sithen that criste is souereyne / and the preste meene & mediatour bi|twex criste & the synnere / & the synnere is the laste bi wey of reson / [991] than sholde nat the synnere sitte as highe as his confessour / but knele biforn him / or at his feete / but if maladie distorbe hit / ffor he shal nat take kepe who sitte there / but in whos place that he sitteth / [992] A man that hath trespased to a lorde / and cometh to axemercy / & maketh his accorde/And he sette him doun anoon bi the lorde / men wold holde him outrageous / & nat worthi so sone to haue remission ne mercy / [993] The .iij. signe is that thi confession shulde be ful of teres if ye may / & if ye may nat wepe with youre bodily eyghe / lete thin herte wepe / [994] suche was the confession of seint Peter ffor after that he had for-sake ihesu criste / \u00b6 Petrus. he went out & wept ful bitterly / [995] The .iiij. signe is that he lett nat for his shame to shewe his confession / [996] suche was the confession of the Magdaleyne / that spared for no shame of hem that were \u00b6 Magdaleyne. at the fest for to go to oure lorde ihesu criste / & biknowe to him hir synne / [997] The .v. signe that a man be obeisaunt or a woman to resceive the penaunce that is to him enioyned / ffor certis ihesu criste / for the giltes of oo man was obediente to the deth // [998] The secunde condicion of verray confession / is that hit be hastily don / ffor certis if a man had a dedly wounde / euer the lenger that he tarieth to warisshe him-selff / the more wold hit corupte / & haste him to his dethe / & eke the wounde wolde be the wers to hele / [999] And right so farith hit bi synne / that longe tyme is in a man vnshewed // [1000] Certis a man ought hastily to shewe his synnes / for many causes / As for drede of dethe that cometh offte sodeynly / & is in no certeyne what tyme hit shal be / ne in what place / And eke the drecching of oo synne / drawith in another synne / [1001] and eke the lenger that he tarieth / the ferther is he from criste / & if he abide in-to his laste day/ful scarsly may he shrive him / or re|membre him on his synnes / or repente him / for the grevous maladie / of his dethe / [1002] And for-asmeche as he hath na in his liff / herkened ihesu criste / whan he hath spoken vn-to him/he shal crien vn-to oure lord ihesu crist at his laste day / & scarsly wol he herken to him / [1003] And vnderstonde that this condicion most haue .iiij. thinges / thi shrifft moot be purveide biforn & avised / for wikked haste doth no profite / & that a man can shrive him of his synnes / be hit of pride or of envie / & so forth with the spices & the circumstaunces / [1004] & that he haue comprehended in his mynde / the nombre & the gretnesse of his synnes / & how longe that he hath leyne in synne / [1005] & eke that he be contrite / of his synnes / & in stedfast purpos bi the grace of god / neuere effte to falle ayeine in synne / & eke that he drede & contrewaite him-selff / that he fle the occaciouns of synne / to whiche he is enclyned / [1006] Also that thow shalt shrive the of alle thi synnes to oo man & nat a parcel to oon / & a parcel to another / that is to vnderstonde / in entente to departen thi confession / as for shame or drede / for hit is nought but strangelyng of thi soule / [1007] ffor certis Ihesu criste is al good / in him is noon imperfeccion / & therfore outher he foryevith al perfitly / or ellis neuera|dele // [1008] I seie nat if thow be assigned to thi penitencere / for certeyne synne that thou art bounde to shewe to him / al the remanent of thi synnes / of whiche thou hast be shriven to thi curate / but if it like the of thin humilite / this is no departing of shrifft / [1009] ne I seie nat there as I speke of diuision of confes|sion / if that thou haue licence for to shrive the to a discrete / & an honest preste / & where the liketh / bi the licence eke of thi curate / that thou ne maiste wel shrive the / of al thi synnes / [1010] but lat no blot be bihynde / lete no synne be vntolde / as fer as thow hast remem|braunce / [1011] And whan thow shalt be shriven to thi curate / telle him eke of al thi synne that thou hast don / sithen that thou were last I-shriven / this is no wikked entente of division of shrifft / [1012] And also the verray shrifft axeth certeyne con|dicions / ffirst that thou shrive the bi thi fre wil / nat constreyned / ne for shame of folke ne for maladie / or suche thinges / ffor it is reson that he that trespaceth with his fre wil / he moot bi his fre wil confesse his trespace / [1013] noon other man shal telle his synne but he him selff / ne he ne shal nat nay it ne denye his synne / ne wretthe him ayeines the preste / for his amonesshynge to lete his synne / [1014] The secunde condicion is / that thi shrifft be lawful that is to seie / that thou that shrivist the / & eke the preste that hireth thi confession / ben verray in the feith of holy chirche // [1015] And that a man be nought dispeired / of the mercy of ihesu criste / as Cayme or Iudas / [1016] and eke a man most accuse him of his owne trespace & nat another / but he shal blame & witen him-selff of his owne malice / & of his synne / & noon other / [1017] but natheles if that anotherman be occacion of his synne / or entiser of his synne / or if the estate of a persone be suche / thorugh whiche his synne is aggreged / or that he ne may nat pleynly shriven him / but he telle the persone / with whiche he hath synned / than may he telle it [1018] so / that his entente be nat to bagbite the persone but onely to declare his con|fession / [1019] Thow shalt nat eke make no maner lesinges in thi confession / for humilite perauenture to seie that thou hast don synnes / of whiche thou were neuere gilti / [1020] ffor seint Austyne seith if \u00b6 Austyne. thow bi cause of humilite makest lesinges of thi selff / though thow ne were nat in synne biforne yit art thow than in synne thorugh thi lesinges [1021] Thow most eke shewe thi synne / bi thi nowe propre mouthe / but if thou be wexe dome / & nat bi no letter / ffor thou that hast don the synne / thou shalt haue the shame in confession / [1022] Thow shalt nat eke peynte thi confession / bi faire & subtile wordes / to couere the more thi synne / ffor than bigilest thou thi selff & nat the preste / thou most telle it platly be it neuere so foule / ne so orrible / [1023] Thow shalt shrive the eke to a preste that is discrete / to counsaile the / And eke thou sha[l]t nat shrive for vaynglorie / ne for ypocresie / ne for no cause but onely for the dovte of Ihesu criste / & the hele of thi soule / [1024] Thow shalt nat eke renne to the preste al sodeynly to telle him thi synne / as whos tellith a Iape or a tale / but avisily / & with grete deuocion / [1025] And generally shrive the offte / if thou offte falle / offte arise bi confession / [1026] And though thou shrive the offter than ones of thi synne / of whiche thow hast be shriven it is the more merite / And as seith seint Austyne / thou \u00b6 Austyne. shalt haue the more lightly relesynge / & the grace of god / both of synne & of peyne / [1027] And certis ones a yere at the leste weye hit is lawful for to be houselede / ffor certenly ones a yere alle thinges renovellen / De satisfaccione. [1028] NOw haue I tolde of verry confession that is the secunde parte of penaunce / [1029] the .iij. parte of penaunce is satisfaccion / & that stant most generally in almes & in bodily peyne / [1030] Now ben ther .iij. manere of almes / Contricion of herte / that a man openeth him selff to god / Another is to have pete of the defaute of his neighbours / And the thride is in yevyng good counsaile / & comforte gostly & bodily / where men haue nede / & namely in sustenaunce of man-is foode / [1031] & to take kepe of that that a man hath nede of / off these thinges generally he hath nede / of foode / of clothing / & herborugh / he hath nede also of charitable counsaille / & visityng in prison / & maladie / & sepulture of his dede bodie / [1032] and if thou maist nat visite the nedeful with thi persone / visite hem bi thi massage / & thi yifftes / [1033] these ben the general almes & workes of charite / of hem that han temporal riches / or discrecion in counsaillyng / Off there workes shalt thow hyre at the day of dome / [1034] these almesses shaltow don of thin owne propre thinges / & hastily & privily if thow maiste / [1035] but natheles if thou maiste nat don hit priuily / thou shalt nat forbere to do almes neuer a dele though men se hit / so that it be nat don for thanke of the world / but onely for to haue the thanke of oure lorde ihesu criste / [1036] ffor as wittnessith Seint Mathew. quinto capitulo / A Cite \u00b6 Mathei quinto Capitulo. may nat be hidde that on a mountayne sette / ne men lighte nat a lanterne & put it vnder a busshel / but men sette hit on a candelstike / to lighten the men in the hous / [1037] Right so shal youre lighte lighten a-forne men that thei mowe seen youre goode workes / & glorifie / youre fader that is in heuen / [1038] Now as for to speke of bodily peyne / it stonte in praieres / in wakynges / in ffastinges / & in vertuous techinges of orisons / [1039] ye shul vnder-stonde that orisons / or praiers is for to seie / a pitous wil of herte / that redressith hit in god / & expressith it bi wordes / outwarde to renewe harmes / & to haue thinges espirituel & durable / & somtyme temporal thinges / off whiche orisons / certis in the orison of the Pater noster / \u00b6 Pater noster. hath ihesu criste enclosed most thinges / [1040] Certis it is privileged of thre thinges in his dignite / ffor whiche it is more digne / than any other praiere / ffor that ihesu criste him selff maked / [1041] and it is shorte / for it sholde be couthe more lightly and for to withholde hit the more esily in herte / & helpen hem selff the offter / with the orison / [1042] And for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seie hit / And for a man may nat excuse him to lerne hit / for it is shorte & so esie / And for hit comprehendith in hit selff / alle good praiers / [1043] The exposicion of this holy praiere / that is so excellent & digne / I bitake these maistres of Theologie / saue thus meche wol I seyne / that whan thou praieste that god sholde foryeve the thi giltes as thou foryeuest hem that agilten the / Be ful wel war / that thou be nat out of charite / [1044] This holy orison amennsith eke venial synne / & therfore hit apperteyneth specially to penaunce / [1045] This praiere most be trewly seide / & in verry feith // & that men praie to god / ordinatly / dis|cretly / & devoutely / And alwey a man shal putte his wil / to be subiette to the wil of god / [1046] this orison most eke be seide / with grete humblesse / & ful pure / honestly & nat to the anoysaunce of any man or woman / hit most eke be contenued with the workes of charite / [1047] hit availeth eke ayeines the vices of the soule / ffor as seith seint Ierome / bi fastynge ben saued the vices of the \u00b6 Ierome flesshe / & bi praiers the vices of the soule / [1048] Affter this thow shalt vnder-stonde / that bodily peyne stonte in waking / for ihesu criste seith / waketh and praieth / that ye ne entre in to wikked temptacion / [1049] ye shul vnder-stonde eke that fast|ynge stonte in thre thinges / in forberynge of bodily meete / and drinke / & in forberinge of worldly iolitees / And in for|beringe of dedly synne / this is to seie / that a man shal kepe him fro dedly synne / with al his myght / [1050] And thou shalt vnderstonde eke that god ordeyned fastinges / & to fastinges apperteynen .iiij. thinges [1051] largenesse to pore folke / gladnesse of herte espirituel / nat to be angry / ne anoyed / ne to grucche for he fasteth / & also at resonable houre for to eete bi mesure / that is for to seie / A man shulde nat eten in vntyme / ne sitte the lenger at his table to ete / for he fasteth / [1052] Than shalt thou vnderstonde that bodily peyne stante in disciplyne or teching / bi worde / or bi writynge / or bi ensample / also in weryng of heires or of stamyne / or of haberions on here naked flesshe / for cristes sake / & suche manere penaunces / [1053] but war the wel that suche penaunces on thi flessh / ne make nought thin herte bitter / or angery / or anoyed / of thi selff / ffor better it is to caste awaie thin heire / than for to caste a-wey the swettnesse of oure lorde ihesu criste / [1054] And therfore seit[h] seint Poule / \u00b6 Poule. Clotheth yow as thei that ben chosen of god / in herte of misericorde / debonairte / suffraunce / & suche manere of clothinge / of whiche ihesu criste is more apaiede / than of heire / or of haberioun / [1055] Than is his disciplyne / in knokkynge of thi breste / in schourginge with yerdes / in knelynges / in tribulacions / [1056] in sufferinge paciently wronges / that ben don to him / And eke vnpacient sufferaunce of maladies / or lesinge of worldly catel / or of wiff / or childe / or other frendes / [1057] Than shalt thou vnderstonde / whiche thinges distourben penaunce / and that is in .iij. maners / And that is drede / shame / & wanhope / that is desperacion / [1058] And for to speken first of drede / ffor whiche he weneth that he may suffre no penaunce / [1059] there ayeines is remedie / for to thenke that bodily penaunce is but shorte / litel / at the regarde of the peyne of helle / that is cruel & so longe / that it lasteth withouten ende / [1060] Now a-yeines the shame that a man hath to shriven him / and namely these ypocrites / that wolden be holde so perfite / that thei haue noon nede to shriven hem / [1061] Ayeines that shame / shal a man thenke / that bi wey of reson / that he / that hath nat ben a-shamed / to do foule thinges / Certis him oughte nat to ben a-shamed to don faire thinges / & goode thinges / & that is confessiouns / [1062] A man shulde eke thenke / that god seeth & woot wel thi thoughtes / thoughtes repeated & al thi workes / to him may nothing be hidde ne couered / [1063] men shulde eke remembre hem of the shame that is to come at the day of dome to them that ben nat penitente / ne shriven in this present liff / [1064] ffor alle the creatures in heuen erthe & in helle / shulle se appertely al that they hiden in this worlde / [1065] Now for to speke of the hope of hem that ben so necligent & slowe to shrive hem / hit stante in two maners / [1066] that on is that he hopeth to live longe / & for to purchase meche riches for his delite / & than he wol shrive him / & as seith he may as him semeth tymely I-nough come to shriffte / [1067] Another is of the surquidrie that he hath in the hope of cristes mercy / [1068] And ayeines the first vice he shal thenke / that oure liff is in no sekernesse / & eke that al the riches in the worlde is in auenture & passinge as a shadowe on a wal // [1069] And as seith seint Gregorie / \u00b6 Gregorius that hit apperteyneth to the grete rightwisnesse of god / that neuere shal the peyne stinte of hem / that neuere wolde withdrawe hem fro synne here thankes but euer contenue in synne / for that perpetual wil to do synne / shullen thei haue perpetual peine // [1070] Wanhope is in two maners / The first wan|hope is in the merci of criste / That other is that thei thenke / that thei myghte nat longe perseuere in good|nesse / [1071] The first wanhope cometh of that he demeth that he hath synned so gretly / so offte / & so longe lien in synne / that he shal nought be sauede / [1072] Certis ayeines that cursed wanhope he shulde thenke / that the passion of ihesu criste is more stronge for to vnbynde / than synne is for to bynde / [1073] Ayeines the seconde wanhope. . . . .[1074] . . no gap in the MS. that he demeth that he shulde nat longe perseuere in goodnes / he shal thenke that the febelnesse of the Deuel may nothing don but if men wil suffre him / [1075] & eke he shal have strengthe of the helpe of god / & of al holy chirche & of the proteccions of Aungels / if hem luste // [1076] Than shul men vnderstonde what is the fruyte of penaunce and last as after the worde of ihesu criste / hit is the endeles blisse of heuen / [1077] there ioye hath no contrariouste of woo / ne greuaunce / there al harmes ben passed of this present liff / there as is the sekernesse from the peyne of helle / there as is the blisful companye that reioysen hem euermore / eueryche of otheris Ioye / [1078] there as the body of man that whilom was foule & derke is more clere than the sonne / there as whilom the bodi was sike freyle feble & mortal / is immortal / & so stronge & so hole / that there may nothinge empeire it / [1079] there as neither is hungre / thrust / ne colde / but euery soule replenesshed with the sight of the perfite knowynge of god / [1080] this blisful regne may man purchace bi pouerte espirituel / & the glorie bi lowe|nesse / the plente of ioye bi hungre & thruste / & the reste bi travaile / & the liff bi deth / & mortificacion of synne / To thilke liff he vs bringe that bought vs with his pre|cious bloode.
