<P>&para; And oure Kynge lete make an diche all withoute, Rounde a-boute the cite, and strongly stakid it, and heggid it, for these prykeris oute on hors backe, and comaundid Syr Robert Babthorp, knyght and Countroller, to ouyr-se that this werke were don; and he did it make in alle haste.  &para; And thanne they issewid oute on ffote, and fought manly as good werriouris; and tho myche pepull weren slayn on bothe sidis.  And they at the wallis and at the touris of the Cite shotten euer Gounnys, quarellis, Trepgettis, Spryngollis; and alwey on the Duke of Gloucestreis side thei diden moche harme, for thei weren loggid nexte of alle pepull to the Cite.  And euyr ther come tydyngis newe that the Burgoynys wold come and reskewe the Cite; and for ioye thereof they ronge alle the bellis in the Cite; and fro the ffirste tyme of shittynge of the yatis of the cite they ronge neuyr bellis but for tho tydyngis tille the cite was goten and yolden to the Kynge of Engelond.</P>
<P>&para; And tho the Kynge wende the Frensshe hoste had byn come, and with good wordis comfortid his pepull, and bad hem ben of good chere.  And anon tydyngis come ayen that thei were turnyd to Paris-ward ayen.  &para; And thanne with-ynne ffewe dayes thei were come to Pounteyse, the nombre of iiij.

And tho the Kynge lete make a lerge duche, alle withoute his hoste, and pight it full of stakes ymade sharpe, that wold perisshe, and with turnepykes, and leid there-by Gounnys redy bent in euyry partye rounde aboute this diche.  And the kynge tho comaundid his countroller Sir Robert Babthorp, knyght, to spede in alle haste this were don by his ouyr sight; and so anon this werke was endid.</P>
<P>&para; And anon come tydynges to the Kynge, there as he lay at seege; and this was on the Thorisday, that the ffrensshe hoste lay but xx. myle from hym, and wold byn there on the morough on the Fryday; and the same tydynge come to hem that were with-ynne the Cite.  &para; Of these tydynge oure Kynge made moche ioye and myrthe, and artely thankyd God.  And so on
<PB N="400"> the Fryday oure Kynge rode to the Erle of Huntyngdon, and told to hym a wile and a good ffete of werre, and made hym ordeyne ij.  Bateillis of men of armys.  &para; And the ffirste bataill thei and he redenn, and her backes toward the Cite; and that othir bataill come oute of the wode, with standerdis and baneris of the Duke of Burgoynys armys.  And these ij hostis metten, as thei had countrid, and foughten to-gederis; but non did othir harme.  And this was ordeynyd and don by the kyngis deuyse and conseile, for thei that weren with-ynne the Cite shuld haue vtturly hopid and trustid that reskewis had ben come, and that thei that weren with-ynne the Cite of men of armys shuld boldely haue issewid oute, and ffoughten vtturly with the pepull of the sege; but thei dorste not come oute of that Cite at that tyme, for thei doutid and drad, and supposid to hem but trayne, and wold not issewe oute for drede of dethe, as for that <MILESTONE UNIT="Galba E.

<P>&para; And tho it drewe nere Cristemesse; and by that tyme her vitailis scarsid sore with-ynne the Cite, for they hade nothir bred, ale, nor wyne, but watir and vynegur, that was her drynke.  And flesshe nor fisshe they had non, but eten hors, doggis, Mis, Rattis and Cattis; for an quarter of an horse, were he lene or fatte, was tho sold in the Cite amonge the pepull for an C.s. good payment, and an hors hede for xx. s., and a Ratte for xl. d.; and for xiij. s. iiij. d. thei sold a Catte, and a mows for xx. d.; and these wormys weren bought and eten so faste that vnnethe thei fonde eny for to selle for no money.  &para; And tho was a ferthynge lof boght in the Cite for a ffranke.  And thanne hem failid bothe whete, and mele, and alle othir graynys that thei myght make of eny brede; but branne and broken wo[r]tis, and nepe-rotis, and lekis, was to hem mete of grete valewe; for a leke was sold for
<PB N="401"> xij. d., and an Egge for ix d., and an appull for x d.: siche merchaundyse was there with-ynne the Cite a gret while; and ther was many a carefulle creature, for her vitailis were alle wastid and spent, and &thorn;ey myght come to no new by no maner wey; for the sege that lay withoute, rounde aboute the Cite, wold suffre no vitaile come in, to hem, neythir by watir neythir be londe.</P>
<P>&para; And thanne be-ganne the pepull with-ynne the Cite to deie faste, bothe smale and grete, for the passynge hungur and enfamen that was amonge hem, by C.C. personys and moo day by day; and there as was firste ioy and pryde, and grete boste, tho was there amonge hem weylynge, sorow and care, and wepynge, and wryngynge with hondis.  &para; And though a child shuld deie, the modir wold yeue it no brede ne nought ellis of othir fode, ne wold not departe no morselle though she myght saue the lif of her child of hir body borne, but wold saue her selfe while she myght; for loue and hertly kyndenesse was tho from hem passid.  Nor the child wold not profir the modir; for eche of hem caste hymself to leue; for alle kyndenesse and loue tho was sette beside; for euyr the childe wold hide his mete and his drynke fro his modir and from alle his othir ffryndis, for his mete thei shuld not see, for thei ete hit alle in pryuete.  &para; And we may preue by that pepull there, that houngir passithe kyndenesse and eke loue, that made her vnrightwesnesse and her cursid leuynge and pryde that regnyd amongis hem in tho dayes, wherefore God sent hem a yerd of chastisement.  But yet thei that kept the wallis and touris of the Cite rounde aboute, be-cause the pepull withoute shuld not knowe nor wete of her grete nede and myschef that thei weren ynne, euyr to hold her courte and contynaunce of opyn werre, bothe with shot of Gounnys and quarellis.</P>
<P>&para; But amonge ther issewid summe pepull of the Cite oute; and they come forthe, and weren take of the wacchemen withoute at the sege Cite.  &para; And they affraynyd hem how it stode with the pepull that weren lefte with-ynne the Cite.  &para; And they ansuerid and told to the Engelisshe pepull of the grete nede,
<PB N="402"> scarste, hungir and dethe, that was euyry day amongis hem.  But our folke wold not beleue nor truste hem, be cause that the pepull with-ynne hilde alle tymes contynaunce like in werre, day be day, as thei did beforne vpon the sege withoute; wherefore thei had hem in no truste in no degre.</P>
<P>And thanne with-ynne a litull while aftur, the worthi men that weren with-ynne the Cite, gederid alle the pore pepull that tho weren with-ynne the Cite, man, woman, and child, and brought hem to the yatis, and put hem oute at euyry porte by an C personys on a rowte, and bad hem helpe hem-self in her beste maner that thei myght, for there thei shold no lenger abyde yn no wyse with hem.  &para; And thanne thei come forthe toward the Engelisshe seege, knelynge on her kneis, and wepynge sore, bothe man, and woman with yonge sowkynge children <MILESTONE UNIT="Galba E. VIII folio" N="139b">in her armys, and olde febull men knelynge besyde hem, makynge there a dilfull crye; for alle they cryed there atonys "haue mercy on vs, ye good and Cristen and worthy men."  &para; And thanne oure Kynge had rewthe on hem and pite, and yaf hem brede and drynke, and made hem turne ayen to the Cite; and there thei kepte hem in the diche, that thei shold not knowe nor here the ordynaunce nor counseile of the seege, ne of her wacche in no wyse, for trayne and treson that myght falle.</P>
<P>&para; And whanne these pore pepull shuld turne ayen, thei made high sorough and grete murmuracion amonge hem-self, and seyden they had leuyr byn sleyn there thanne go ayen into the Cite, and dilfully, with high voycis bannynge and cursynge her owne nacion, for thei that weren with-ynne the Cite wold not suffre hem come in ayen; wherfore y trowe thei diden grete synne and myschieff to hem-self; for meny of him deiden there for colde, that, and thei had byn with-ynne, her lifis might haue byn sauyd and kepte.</P>
<P>&para; And tho was come the tyme of Cristmesse, in whiche oure Kynge did tho grete mercy and relef to his enemyes, at the reuerence of that Glorious feste of the brythe of oure Lorde Ihesu Criste and of his blessid modir, oure Lady Seynt Marye, that
<PB N="403"> gracious and mercifull virgyne.  For, of high pite, mercy and grace, and at the reuerence of that tyme of the holy feste, the Kynge, of high compascion that he had in hert, and of his worthi and excellente manhode, sent oute his heraudis in good araye, bothe to hem that weren wyth-ynne the Cite as welle as with-oute the Cite, on the Cristemesse day self, to hem that lackid vitaile, that thei shold come and haue mete and drynke ynow, in worship of the Feste, and sauf-condite to come and to goo.  And thei seiden alle 'gramersis' lightly, as thei had no nede there-to, and set no pryce by his sonde.  And vnnethe thei wold graunte space vnto the pepull of her owne nacion to ben releuyd that layn in the diche vndir the Cite wallis, that thei had drouen and put oute of grete myschieff.  But two preestis and iiij seruauntis for to brynge hem vitailles, mete and drynke; and if ther come eny moo personys, thei wold shete to hem and sle hem to dethe.  &para; And thanne weren alle these pore pepull set arowe; and these two preestis with her iiij. seruauntis broughten hem plente of mete and drynke, of the Kyngis gracious almys; and so thei weren at that tyme made welle at eese; and replete of mete and drynke.

<P>IN the xiij<SUP>the</SUP> yere of the regne of Kyng Henry the vjte, was the grettest froste that was in many a day before; for it began vppon Saynt Kateryn even, and lastit to &thorn;e iiij<SUP>te</SUP> day of Marche, the space of xvj wekes.  And Temmes &thorn;at tyme was so sore frosen, that the vintage of Burdeux went ouer Shoters Hill: for &thorn;e shippis with wyne myght come no nerre then Sandewiche.  and &thorn;at froste &thorn;at tyme distroyet oisters, and muskelles, and fresshe-water fissh, thrugh &thorn;e moost party of Englond.  &para; In &thorn;at same yere was &thorn;e trety of Arras betwene the Kyng of Englond, Henry the vj<SUP>te</SUP>, And Philipe, Duyke of Burgoyn; and Charles de Valoice, Dolfyn of Fraunce, that tyme beyng there in enbasshat for &thorn;e Kyng of Englond, Henry, Cardynall of Englond, Bisshope of Wynchester, Iohn Kempe, Erchbisshope of York, Iohn, Erle of Huntyngton; Pole, Erle of Suffolk, Prevey Seale, Sir Waulter Hongerford, Sir Iohn Poppahm, with a faire feleshipe with hem, to &thorn;e nomber of viijC men.  att which trety, &thorn;ai wold the Kyng of Englond shuld have putte out &thorn;e floure de lice out of his Armes; and many o&thorn;er thynges was spoken of; but to say shortly, &thorn;ei couth not accord; wherfore they departit thens, and come home ageyn into Englonde.  but thay of &thorn;e toun of Popperyng in Flaundres demenet hem vngentilly, and entretid hym vnmanerly as he come rydyng

<P>&para; Then, as sone as thenbassetoures were departet from Arras, and home, the Dolfyn and the Duyke of Burgoyn were accordet, and made att one for deth of the Duyk of Burgoyns fader, &thorn;at was slayn att Muttereux by &thorn;e same Dolfyn; and &thorn;erwith endit all that trety.

And in &thorn;at same yere dyet the Duyke of Bedford in Roan, on Holy-Rode even in May, which had layn longe seeke; for whos deth was made muche mone amonges Englisshe men that were &thorn;at tyme in Normaundy; for as long as he levit, he was doutet and dred amonges the Frenssh men.</P>
<P>&para; In the xiiij yere of the regn of &thorn;e said Henry the vj<SUP>te</SUP>, Humfrey, Duyke of Gloucester, Protectour and Deffendour of Englond, was made Capteyn of Caleis; and he was Capteyn of Guysnes before that tyme; And so he was both Capteyn of Caleis and of Guysnes.  And he made Sir Iohn Radcliffe his Leotenaunt of Caleis, and sent hym thedir; which was a wurshipfull kny&yogh;t, and was welbelouet amonges &thorn;e sawdiours there: for he kept and helde A gud and open housold to who &thorn;at wolde come, and welcome.  &para; Then come tithynges ich day more and more of &thorn;e seege comyng to Caleis.  Then Sir John Radecliff, &thorn;e Leotenaunt of &thorn;e toune, Robert Clidrowe &thorn;e Meyre, and Thomas Thirland, Leotenaunt of &thorn;e staple of Caleis, with &thorn;e sawdioures, marchaundes, and burgeses and comyners, kest vp a faire brode dike on &thorn;e south side of the toune, and made iij stronge bullwerkes of erthe and cley, one att &thorn;e corner of &thorn;e Castell with-out &thorn;e toun, ano&thorn;er att Bulleyn gate, and ano&thorn;er att &thorn;e postern be &thorn;e Princes Inne; And att Mylke gate was a faire bulwerk made of breke, &thorn;at Richard Woodevile had do make or he was discharget of his leotenauntshippe.

And so &thorn;ere come many, and were there sworn; and many went theire way into Flaundres, and wold not be sworn.  &para; And on Saynt George day, Sir Iohn Radcliff sent word prevely to &thorn;e Daywach of &thorn;e toune in &thorn;e nonetyme to rynge <MILESTONE UNIT="Harleian MS. 53 folio" N="163a">out the larom bell, vnwetyng to the sawdioures of &thorn;e toune.
