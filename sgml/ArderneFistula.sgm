Nicaise,<NOTE>"La grande chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac."  Paris, 1890, pp. x-xv.</NOTE> has been divided into four great epochs.  The first, lasting from the fifth to the eleventh century, was remarkable for the Arabian school of medicine.  The second period embraced the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and witnessed the rise of the schola Salernitana: it was the time of the Crusades and of that intermingling of the East and West from which sprang the marvellous work of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  The work of the third period was all too short, and was brought to a sudden close by the Black Death which ravaged the world in 1348-9.  It is properly described as the beginning of the modern era, the pre-Renaissance.  A mere list of the Universities established will give some idea of the intellectual activity of the time.  Montpellier (1137); Paris (1176); Oxford (1200); Cambridge (1209); Padua (1222); Naples (1224); Salamanca (1230); Toulouse (1230); Orl&eacute;ans (1231); Valladolid (1250); Seville (1254); Coimbra-Lisbon (1290); Lerida (1300); Avignon (1303); Rome (1303); Grenoble (1332); Angers (1337); Pisa (1343); Prague (1347); Florence (1349); Perpignan (1349); Huesca (1359); Cracovia (1364); Pavia (1365); Orange (1365); Vienna (1365); Erfurt (1379); Heidelberg (1385); Cologne (1388); Buda (1389).<NOTE>The dates appended to the Universities are merely intended to show when each was known to be actually in existence&mdash;a few were created, the majority developed from small beginnings.</NOTE>  The fourth period was retrograde.  Wars abroad and economic troubles at home seemed to have crushed the spirit of the few survivors from the previous generation.</P><P>John Arderne belongs to the thirteenth century in spirit and in thought, although the accident of birth placed him in the next generation.  He was well educated, and he reflects the current ideas of his time just as every well-educated surgeon at the present day is an epitome of his surroundings.  Nothing is known of his history except for the autobiographical details given in the various manuscripts of his works and a small body of floating tradition which has been handed down through the centuries.</P><PB N="x"><DIV2 TYPE="section"><HEAD>BIOGRAPHICAL FACTS.</HEAD><P>There seems to be little doubt that he was a member of the family of Arderne, or Arden, who claimed descent from Saxon times.  The best known representative of the family was Turchill or Turketil, styled de Warwic in Domesday, and De Eardene in the Register of Abingdon Abbey, "being one of the first here in England that, in imitation of the Normans, assumed a surname.<NOTE>Dugdale, 675.</NOTE>  The Ardernes were Lords of Watford in Northamptonshire from 1140, and spread thence to Cheshire and Staffordshire.  In the Aldford, Cheshire, branch the name of John was borne hereditarily by John de Arderne (fl. 1220); Sir John de Arderne (1266-1308?); Sir John de Arderne (1307-1349); and John de Arderne (fl. 1332).<NOTE>"Parentalia," Genealogical Memoirs, compiled by George Ormerod, D.C.L. F.R.S., privately printed 1851.</NOTE>  It was possibly the lastnamed John Arderne<NOTE>Perhaps it was this John Arderne who is mentioned in Rymer's "F&oelig;dera" (vol. ii, part 2, p. 119, col. 2).  He was commanded to attend the King in war to Guienne in the year 1324.</NOTE> who received a grant of land in Connaught from Edward the Black Prince (Appendix, p. 105), and who is mentioned in John of Gaunt's Register<NOTE>I, 337, leaf 64, back.  I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Sydney Armitage-Smith for this reference.</NOTE> as having been appointed Seneschal of the manor of Passenham in Northamptonshire on October 7th, 1374.  The name of John Arderne, or John de Arderne, therefore, was well known in London,<NOTE>In London John Arderne was a Fishmonger in 1361, and Richard Arderne was a prominent Skinner in 1376.  John Arderne, esquire, was living in the parish of St. Mary Aldermariachurch in 1425.  (Dr. Reginald Sharpe's "Calendar of Wills&mdash;Court of Husting."  London, part 2, pp. 63 and 439.)</NOTE> in the midlands and in the counties of Cheshire and Lancaster during the fourteenth century, but there is no evidence forthcoming at present to show to which branch of the family the surgeon belonged.</P><P>The date of Arderne's birth is fixed by his own statement that he was seventy in the first year of the reign of Richard II.  Edward III died at Sheen on June 21, 1377, and was immediately succeeded by Richard II.  Arderne, therefore, was born in 1307.<NOTE>Sloane MS. 75, leaf 146.  <FOREIGN>De Cur&acirc; Oculi</FOREIGN>.

It is now in the Surgeon General's Library at Washington, U.S.A.  The extract on leaf 54 is, "<FOREIGN>Hoc probavi in uno rege et duobus episcopis in transmarinis partibus</FOREIGN>."  It is quoted in the "Johns Hopkins Bulletin," vol. v, 1894, pp. 21 and 67, but I am indebted to the courtesy of Lient.-Col. Walter D. McCaw, Librarian S. G. O., for a complete transcription of the passage.</NOTE>  I have no doubt in my own mind that the king was John of Gaunt, "Roy de Castell et de Leon, Duc de Lancastre," who was always addressed as "Monseigneur d'Espaigne."<NOTE>"John of Gaunt," by Sydney Armitage-Smith, p. 258.</NOTE>  In 1376 John of Gaunt was the best hated man in England, says Mr. Sydney Armitage-Smith in his valuable study of his life.  It was undesirable, therefore, John Arderne would think, to draw too close attention to the fact that he had once been attached to his person, for the book was written in this very year 1376.  The precaution was wise in view of the events which happened when a London mob burnt the Duke's palace at the Savoy in 1381 and killed his physician, merely because he was a trusted and valued friend.<NOTE><FOREIGN>Johannes de ordine Minorum in armis bellicis strenuus, in physica peritissimus, domino Johanni duci Lancastriae familiarissimus</FOREIGN>."&mdash;Knighton's Chronicle-Rolls Series, ii, 133.</NOTE>  Mr. Sydney Armitage-Smith<NOTE><HI REND="i">Op. cit</HI>. p. 248, note.</NOTE> says that the name of the physician was William de Appleton, and that he was retained by the Duke of Lancaster at 40 marcs per annum for life.  An interesting example of the caution which was habitual to Ardern in this matter is to be found in two of the manuscripts in the British Museum.  The one<NOTE>Sloane MS. 3548.</NOTE> tells of a certain noble knight in the service of the Duke of Lancaster at Alge&ccirc;iras, in Spain, who had a sudden attack of facial paralysis, which so twisted his mouth that it was drawn back nearly to his ear and prevented him from speaking.  The manuscript continues, "I, the aforesaid John Ardern, made a cure of him."  The second manuscript<NOTE>Sloane 29301.</NOTE> gives an account of the same case, but, instead of giving any name to the leech who cured him, it merely says "for whom the King of Spain's doctor made a cure in this way."<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Quidam miles nobilis Ducis Lancastriae apud Agezir in Hispania passus est subito torturam oris ita quod os ejus distractum fuit fere retro aurem nec loqui poterat.  Ego Predictus Joh. Ardern talem feci sibi curam</FOREIGN>" (MS. 3548). "<FOREIGN>Cui medicus regis hyspaniae talem curam fecit</FOREIGN>," says MS. 29301.</NOTE>  The latter MS. is a magnificently written copy on vellum, with such carefully executed illustrations that it is usually exhibited in the British Museum as an example of fourteenth-century work.  It was possibly a presentation copy to John of Gaunt himself; the first one is a poorly written paper manuscript, such as would have an ordinary<PB N="xii">circulation.  It was copied at a much later date, for the scribe, by mistake, has written Henrici de Arderne, and it belonged to Robert May.</P><P>Haeser<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Lehrbuch d. geschichte der Med</FOREIGN>.," ed. 3, Jena, 1875, i, 784.</NOTE> says that perhaps Arderne was educated at Montpellier and practised in France as a military surgeon on the English side during the earlier and most brilliant years of the One Hundred Years' War.  E. H., who translated his "Latin practises and consailes concerning the helping of all diseases,"<NOTE>Sloane MS. 2271.</NOTE> in the early part of the seventeenth century, is responsible for the statement that he practised at Antwerp, and he certainly knew a few words of Flemish, for, in speaking of the Nightshade, he says that in Flanders it is called "Naghtstach" (p. 32).</P><P>Dr. Milward<NOTE>A circular invitatory letter . . . concerning . . . British Physical and Chirurgical Authors, by Edward Milward, M.D., Lond. 1740, p. 23.</NOTE> believed that he was present at the battle of Cre&ccirc;y, but this I take leave to doubt.  He practised, or at any rate he treated patients, in Wiltshire,<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Hoc probavi in vicecomite Wilteshure</FOREIGN>," says the MS. in the Surgeon-General's Library at Washington, U.S.A., quoted in the "Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin," vol. v, 1894, pp. 21 and 67, and I am again indebted to Lieut.-Col. McCaw for verifying the reference.</NOTE> and from 1349 until 1370 he lived at Newark in Nottinghamshire.<NOTE>Teste all the MSS.</NOTE>  He came to London in 1370, but I have found no record of where he lived.  It was the year of his grand climacteric, in an age when men lived a much shorter time than now, yet he practised with vigour and success for five or six years.  By this time he had secured a competence and he set himself to write.  In 1376 he issued his treatise on the cure of Fistula in ano which is here printed, "written," as he says, "with my own hand, in the year when the strong and warlike Lord" (Edward the Black Prince) "was taken to God."<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Et eodem anno quo Dominus strenuus et bellicosus Princeps migravit ad Dominum, scripsi libellum istum manu propria, viz. Millesimo ccclxxvi. . . . quem Deus absolvat, quia fuit flos Milici&aelig; Mundi sine pare</FOREIGN>."</NOTE>  It is possible that the treatise on Clysters<NOTE>See <HI REND="i">postea</HI>, p. 74 <HI REND="i">et seqq</HI>.</NOTE> was already written; it is certain that the treatise "De cura oculorum" was written in 1377,<NOTE>P. x, note 6, of these Forewords.</NOTE> but we know nothing more than this about John Arderne.  There is nothing to show that he was living in the reign of Henry IV, who came to the throne in 1399.  The reference to Henry IV (p. 74), "With this medicine was kyng Henry of ynglond cured of the going out of the lure," is a side-note written in a different hand in some of the MSS. and has only crept into the English text in<PB N="xiii">process of time.  The Hunterian copy of the Commentary in English on "<FOREIGN>Aegidii Corboliensis tractatus metricus de Urinis</FOREIGN>," which mentions the leech of "our Lord King the most illustrious prince Henry the Fourth, on whose soul may God have Mercy, Amen," was clearly written after 20 March, 1413, and the scribe has forgotten Arderne's right name, for he says that it is written by Master John Arderon.<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Ego Magister Johannes Arderonn hoc opusculum composui de judiciis urinarum per colores et contenta secundum indicium Egidii et Ypocratis, Walterii, Gilis, Gilberti, Gordoni, Johannis de Sancto Amando, Ysaac, Auicenne, theophili, Galyeni, Galterii et tholomei in medicinam et medicum domini regis illustrissimi principis henrici quarti cujus anime propicietur deus</FOREIGN>.  Amen." The MS. is in the Hunterian Library at Glasgow, No. 328, U. 7, 22 (cf. Notes, 59/32).</NOTE></P><P>It seems to me that the easiest way to correlate the various facts recorded about John Arderne is to assume that he was attached at first to Henry Plantagenet, the first Duke of Lancaster, and afterwards to John of Gaunt, who married his younger daughter Blanche as his first wife&mdash;the White Lady of Chaucer's "Book of the Duchess."  Henry, as Earl of Derby, was at Antwerp in 1338, and John Arderne is said to have practised there.  Henry, in company with the Earl of Salisbury, fought against the Moors at the siege of Alge&ccirc;iras in 1343, when much use was made of Greek fire, and gunpowder is said to have been employed for the first time.  John Arderne had been to Alge&ccirc;iras because he treated a knight there who was suffering from a trivial complaint from which he would have recovered during the long journey, if he had visited Arderne in England.  Arderne was interested both in Greek fire and in gunpowder, for he gives a receipt for making Ignis Gr&aelig;cus and for an artificial fire to burn ships.  Henry of Lancaster was Lieutenant and Captain of Aquitaine in 1345, and was granted the town of Bergerac with the right of coinage in 1347.  John Arderne nowhere says specifically that he served with the Earl of Derby, Duke of Lancaster, but he betrays an intimate knowledge of this campaign, for he gives the names of the towns in the order in which they were reached by the invading army and not in their geographical succession; his knowledge is even remarkable, for he gives the towns in the order in which they were reached by a single column of the army, and he was writing more than thirty years after the events.<NOTE>"The forsaid sir Adam (p. 1, line 12 <HI REND="i">et seqq</HI>.) forsooth suffering from fistula in ano asked counsel of all the leeches and surgeons that he could find in Gascony, at Bordeaux, at Bergerac, Toulouse, Narbonne and Poitiers."  Arderne seems to have had a soft place in his heart for Narbonne.  He calls one of his favourite plaisters Emplastron de Nerbon, and says, "<FOREIGN>Istud emplastron dicitur Norbon quia quamvis sit nigrum tamen bonum</FOREIGN>."  ("This emplastre is called Noirbon, for although it be black nevertheless it is good."  P. 91, l. 31.)</NOTE></P><PB N="xiv"><P>The campaign ended and the Duke of Lancaster returned to London, 13th January, 1347-8, and died of the plague at Leicester in 1361.  John Arderne may then have attached himself to John of Gaunt, the son-in-law of the Duke, who called himself King of Castile and Leon from his marriage with Constance, daughter of Don Pedro I of Castile, in September 1371, until his own daughter Katherine married Enrique III in 1388, and became Queen of Castile and Leon in 1390.  If Arderne was really surgeon to the King of Castile it must have been after the year 1370, and this perhaps gives the reason why John Arderne left Newark after he had practised there for so many years.  Mr. Armitage-Smith tells me, however, that there is no record of such an appointment in the Duke's roll which he has lately published.</P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="section"><HEAD>ARDERNE AS A SURGEON.</HEAD><P>John Arderne is a good example of a type of surgeon who has happily never been absent from England.  He is the earliest example that we know at present, but he was followed in direct succession by Thomas Morstede, who was present at Agincourt in 1415, and was buried in St. Olave, Upwell, in the Jewry, in 1450; by Richard Ferris, who wrote nothing, but was revered as their master by many succeeding generations of surgeons in London.  He died, an old man, in 1566, and had seen much service in the wars of Henry VIII. William Clowes (1540-1604), my great predecessor at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, learnt much of him.  Clowes handed on the tradition to John Woodall (1556-1643), and Woodall to Richard Wiseman (1622-1676), the surgeon of the Commonwealth.  Wiseman was succeeded by Samuel Sharp (1700 (?)-1778) of Guy's Hospital, and by Percivall Pott (1714-1788) at St. Bartholomew's.  The distinguishing mark of each was the possession of the qualities which make an English gentleman as well as a fine surgeon.  They were all men of good education, wide experience, and sound judgment. John Arderne possessed these qualities in abundance.  He preferred personal experience to the teaching of the schools.  He would rather learn by experiment than by authority, and with characteristic frankness he related his failures as well as his successes (p. 83).  He was not in advance of his time, for he believed, like every one else, in Astrology (p. 16).  He kept his methods as secret as he could by giving fancy names to his ointments and plaisters (p. 89), and by writing his charm in Greek letters "ne a laicis perspicietur" (p. 103).</P><PB N="xv"><P>John Arderne wrote on Fistula, on diseases of the Eye, on Clysters, on Bleeding; on Plants and their Uses, and he also published a common-place book containing various receipts and notes of cases arranged without any method.  There exists also his Commentary on Giles de Corbeil's metrical treatise "de Urinis" (p. xiii, note 1), and he is the author of a "Scala Sanitatis contra plagas."  By some means he had access to a large medical library, for he quotes the very words of the manuscripts to which he refers in his treatise on H&aelig;morrhoids (p. 55, line 3), and it is evident that they were lying before him as he wrote.  It is clear from the number of manuscripts which still remain in the various libraries (Bibliography, pp. xxxiv and xxxv) that Arderne's works were read and valued by his contemporaries and immediate successors.  They were written originally in Latin, and, as he is careful to explain, with his own hand, but English translations were soon produced.  The Latin is of the colloquial type like that in which the "<FOREIGN>Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</FOREIGN>" was written in the early years of the sixteenth century, neither better nor worse, and when Arderne was at fault for a Latin word he never scrupled to use its English or French equivalent.  His handwriting was as crabbed as his style, if, as there is some reason for believing, the Sloane MS., No. 75, is a holograph in so far as it deals with diseases of the eyes. The treatise on Fistula in Ano is certainly the most interesting and practical of Arderne's works.  John Read published an abstract of a part of this treatise in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but it has never been printed in full until now, and for this purpose an early fifteenth-century translation has been selected.</P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="section"><HEAD>THE TREATMENT OF FISTULA IN ANO.</HEAD><P>Arderne's attention was no doubt called to the subject of Fistula by the actual cases which came to him for relief.  The hardship of the Hundred Years' War must have produced many cases of ischio-rectal abscess which ended in fistula.  Wet, cold, long hours in the saddle weighted down by the heavy armour of the time, would readily lead to this condition in the knightly class; whilst the sedentary habits and gross feeding causing chronic constipation would account for it in the religious and civic population.  Tubercle, too, was rife in the fourteenth century, but it would be interesting to learn whether the Black Death left an aftermath of boils and abscesses.  The work is full of detail, and shows the author to be original, thoughtful, observant, and a master of his art both in theory and practice.  He <PB N="xvi">says, very rightly, that the treatment of fistula in ano had fallen into disrepute because it was a troublesome condition which brought very little credit to surgeons, whilst it required long and patient treatment for which the majority of the sufferers were not prepared to pay.  An examination of the writings of the immediate predecessors and contemporaries of John Arderne shows that these statements are literally correct.  To go back no farther than Albucasis, who died in 1013,<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Methodus Medendi certa, clara et brevis</FOREIGN>," Lib. ii, cap. 810.  Basil, 1541, p. 132.</NOTE> it was taught that complete fistul&aelig; were incurable, and that all operations and the application of ointments was but labour in vain. Some believed that a cure could be obtained occasionally, and Albucasis advised, therefore, that a small copper or iron probe should be introduced into the bowel through the fistula which should then be laid open in its whole extent until the probe fell out.  But if the bleeding were so severe as to stop the operation, or the surgeon was afraid of the h&aelig;morrhage, the actual cautery might be used.  In other cases, Albucasis taught, a probe armed with a ligature of five strands might be passed from the external orifice of the fistula through its track into the rectum.  The end of the probe was then caught by the finger and drawn out through the anus bringing with it one end of the ligature.  The two ends of the ligature, the one hanging out of the fistula and the other from the anus, were then tied tightly together, care being taken to include as much tissue as possible.  The knot was tightened on the second or third day, and as often afterwards as was necessary.  The fistula was thus cured by the ligature cutting its way out, the track behind it healing by granulation.</P><P>William de Salicet (fl. 1245), who taught surgery at Bologna, and was considered the most skilful surgeon of his age, had so great a dread of fistula that he wrote:<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Chirurgie de Guillaume de Salicet</FOREIGN>."

But if he decide to undertake it the orifice should be dilated with a sponge tent and the whole track burnt with the actual cautery.

Paris, 1890, p. 134.</NOTE></P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="section"><HEAD>ARDERNE'S OPERATION FOR FISTULA.</HEAD><P>John Arderne's operation is clearly a modification of the method recommended by Albucasis, and, like a good surgeon, he preferred a clean incision to fretting the fistula through with a ligature tied tightly.  He recommends that the patient should be secured in the lithotomy position.  A probe&mdash;called appropriately enough, sequere me&mdash;is passed through the fistula until it is felt in the rectum.  The eye of the probe is then threaded with a ligature of four strands&mdash;the fr&aelig;num C&aelig;saris&mdash;which is drawn through the fistula as the probe is pulled out of the rectum until one end hangs out of the anus and the other from the opening of the fistula.  These two ends are knotted together and the whole ligature is tightened by means of a peg&mdash;the wrayste&mdash;fixed into the widest part of a gorget&mdash;the tendiculum&mdash;in the same way that a violin peg tightens the strings passing round it. The use of the ligature is partly to control the bleeding and partly to maintain a correct line while the fistula is being divided.  The gorget or tendiculum is pushed well up into the fistula and a grooved director with a curved end&mdash;the acus rostrata, or snowted needle&mdash;is passed along it until the end projects into the rectum where the probe had<PB N="xviii">been previously inserted.  A shield&mdash;the cochlearia, or spoon&mdash;with a depression in its centre is then passed through the anus until the grooved director engages in the depressed notch.  The object of this shield is partly to prevent the surgeon cutting down upon his own finger and partly to protect the opposite wall of the rectum should the patient struggle or make a sudden movement at the moment the fistula is divided.  A scalpel&mdash;the razor or lance&mdash;is passed along the groove in the acus rostrata, and the fistula is cleanly divided along its whole length by drawing the knife, the acus rostrata, and the spoon out of the rectum with a single movement, the ligature or fr&aelig;num C&aelig;saris coming away at the same time.  Each branch of the fistula may be laid open in turn if the patient can bear it, or any farther operation can be postponed, as Arderne had found by experience that when the main track was laid open the other channels often healed of themselves.</P><P>The operation was a good one, except that his instruments were needlessly cumbersome, and would cure a fistula equally well at the present day, but the great advance which Arderne made was in avoiding the corrosive and irritating after-treatment used by every one else.  It is difficult now to put ourselves in his position and to realize what an amount of originality it meant for a surgeon in the fourteenth century to leave a wound alone and not to try and kill it with the actual cautery or with caustics.  Such a method was contrary to all teaching, and would seem to be undertaken with the very greatest risk.  Yet John Arderne only applied a little oil of roses with the white or yolk of an egg, and he washed the wound with tepid water and a sponge. He never changed the dressings oftener than he could help (p. 87), but he was careful to see that they were not soiled, whilst his experience with simple enemata led him to prefer a clyster of salt and water to the powerful purgatives in ordinary use.  Some of his patients recovered, therefore, and he was not slow to advertise the fact; but the weight of authority was against him, and in spite of his success, surgeons preferred to mundify their wounds and use incarnatives for nearly five hundred years after his death.</P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="section"><HEAD>THE MASTER SURGEONS.</HEAD><P>The position which Arderne occupied was perfectly well recognized both in England and France, and was identical with that which we occupy at the present time as consulting and operating surgeons.  In France such surgeons were known in Arderne's time as surgeons of the <PB N="xix">long robe, to distinguish them from the barbers practising surgery, who were surgeons of the short robe.  In England the prefix of Master indicated the difference, and John Arderne is careful therefore always to style himself Magister Johannes de Arderne, Magister being his title as Master of Surgery, which distinguished him, on the one hand, from the Doctor of Physic who was his superior, and, on the other, from the Barber and the Apothecary who ranked below him. The Master Surgeons formed a small guild in London from very early times, and records of persons entrusted with its supervision are known as early as 1369.<NOTE>South's "Craft of Surgery," p. 17.  Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co., London, 1886.</NOTE>  Arderne calls himself "cirurgorum minimus" (p. x, note 6), and he was probably admitted a member of this guild when he came to London in 1370, in which case Master John Dunheued, Master John Hyndstoke and Master Nicholas Kildesby would be three of his colleagues.  The guild never contained many members, but what it lacked in numbers it made up in influence, and, in spite of many struggles with the more numerous Guild of Barbers, it was able to hold its own for many years.  The Guild of Surgeons united for a short time with the Physicians about 1423, and finally became merged into the United Company of Barbers and Surgeons in 1540.  But it is unnecessary to trace the growth and development of the Guild of Surgeons, and those who are interested in it will find a fuller account in "The Medical Magazine" for 1899.  The present treatise contains slight references to the struggle which was going on between the Surgeons and the Barbers at the time it was written.  There is the case, for instance (p. 100), of the rich fishmonger who had a lacerated wound of the arm which was made worse by the incompetent treatment of a barber who had stuffed it with corrosive dressings. Arderne tore off the dressings and replaced them by a soothing fomentation which allowed the patient to have a good night's rest.</P><P>But the human interest of the treatises here published is concentrated in Arderne's description of the qualities required in a good surgeon (p. 4).  It sets forth his ideal of the morals and etiquette of the highest class of surgeons&mdash;the Masters of Surgery&mdash;during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and shows that it was at least as high as it is amongst the best men of the present day.  Pity, charity, continence in all things, the patient first but the fee not unimportant, because then as now the labourer was worthy of his hire, were the distinguishing characteristics of the educated surgeon.</P><P>Henri de Mondeville gives similar rules in somewhat greater detail. <PB N="xx">I quote partly from Prof. E. Nicaise's splendid edition of his works,<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Chirurgie de Ma&icirc;tre Henri de Mondeville, compos&eacute;e de 1306 &agrave; 1320</FOREIGN>," <FOREIGN>par</FOREIGN>Ed. Nicaise.  Paris, 1893, pp. 91 <HI REND="i">et seqq</HI>.</NOTE>and partly from the contemporary translation into French, published by Dr. A. Bos:<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Soc. des Anciens Textes Fran&ccirc;ais</FOREIGN>."  Paris, 1897, tome i, p. 140.</NOTE> "A Surgeon ought to be fairly bold.  He ought not to quarrel before the laity, and although he should operate wisely and prudently, he should never undertake any dangerous operation unless he is sure that it is the only way to avoid a greater danger.  His limbs, and especially his hands, should be well-shaped with long, delicate and supple fingers which must not be tremulous.  He ought to promise a cure to every patient, but he should tell the parents or the friends if there is any danger.  He should refuse as far as possible all difficult cases, and he should never mix himself up with desperate ones.  He may give advice to the poor for the love of God only, but the wealthy should be made to pay well.  He should neither praise himself nor blame others, and he should not hate any of his colleagues.  He ought to sympathise with his patients in their distress and fall in with their lawful requests so far as they do not interfere with the treatment. Patients, on the other hand, should obey their surgeons implicitly in everything appertaining to their cure.  The surgeon's assistants must be loyal to their surgeon and friendly to his patients. They should not tell the patient what the surgeon said unless the news is pleasant, and they should always appear cheerful.  They must agree amongst themselves as well as with the patients, and they must not be always grumbling, because this inspires fear and doubt in the patient."</P><P>De Mondeville then shows how an honest surgeon may be replaced and damaged by one who is less conscientious, for he says: "A rich man has the beginning of an inflammation.  He calls in an upright surgeon, who says after examining him, 'Seigneur, there is no need for any operation here, because nature will relieve herself, etc.; but if the inflammation gets worse, send for me.'  It then happens that the patient calls in another man who is a quack, and he is told, 'Seigneur, you have a great deal of inflammation, I can feel it inside, and if you are not treated at once you will certainly regret it.'  This surgeon then sets to work and makes an inflammation, which he afterwards cures, so that the whole proceeding redounds to his credit and profit, for he discovered an inflammation which did not exist, whilst the first surgeon is damaged both in his reputation and his pocket because he did not find out what was not there."</P><PB N="xxi"><P>"Then again, one of these second-rate surgeons will come to a sick man who is wealthy, and will say to him, with the voice of an archangel&mdash;taking care that no witnesses are present&mdash;'Seigneur, you must remember that you are the one who is ill and in pain.  It is not your son or your nephew.  It is you who are kept awake by the pain whilst your friends and servants sleep.  Others won't take care of you if you don't take care of yourself.  You are rich enough to get advice and to buy health and whatever else you want if you choose to do so. Riches are not more than health, nor is poverty worse than sickness. Have you not made the greater part of your money yourself and for yourself, so that if you are not a miser you can apply it to relieve your wants?  Would to God that those who look after you so badly had your complaint.  But all this is between ourselves, and what I tell you is only out of pity for you and for your good.'  Then, in the absence of the patient, he speaks to the relatives and says, 'Seigneurs, this man has the greatest confidence in you, and, truly, if you lose him, you will lose an excellent friend.  It is not to your credit either to let him go without advice, for if he died without advice you would be blamed everlastingly, even if it made him as poor as Job.  He is really in great danger, and it is a serious case, but nature sometimes does better than we have any right to expect.  He is sure to die if no one treats him, but if he is properly treated it is just possible that he will escape and not die.  If he dies it won't be the result of the treatment, because he is nearly dead already, his only chance is to have a consultation, etc.  I am speaking to you as a friend and not as a doctor.'</P><P>"But it is quite another matter when this same surgeon has to treat a poor man, for he says, 'I am really sorry for you, and I would gladly help you for the love of God only.  But I am very busy just now with a lot of difficult cases, and, besides, the season is not a very favourable one for an operation.  You can't afford to buy what is necessary for your case, such as drugs and dressings, so I would put it off until the summer.  You will then be able to get the herbs and whatever else is wanted and so save expense.  The summer, too, is the best time for the poor.'  When the same pauper comes back in the summer the surgeon says to him, 'I am very sorry that I put you off in the winter and told you to wait until the summer, because the winter is really the best time.  Summer is too hot and there is a fear of stirring up the disease.  I should advise you to wait until the hot weather is over.'  And this goes on everlastingly, for this kind of surgeon never finds time to operate upon a pauper."</P><PB N="xxii"><P>De Mondeville classifies his patients according to their ability to pay fees.  "The first class are paupers who must be treated for nothing; the second class are a little better off, and may send presents of fowls and ducks; they pay in kind.  The third class are friends and relations who pay no fixed fee, but send victuals or presents in token of gratitude, but no money.  Our assistants ought to suggest the presents to this class, saying behind our backs, and as if we knew nothing about it, when anything is said about money, 'No, indeed, the Master would not like it, and you would do much better to make him a little present, though I am sure that he does not expect anything.'  Indeed, a sharp assistant sometimes makes more by such suggestions than the Master does by his operation, and it is just like doubling the fee on account of the horse when the Master makes his visits on horseback.  Then there is a class embracing those who are notoriously bad payers, such as our nobility and their households, government officials, judges, baillies and lawyers, whom we are obliged to treat because we dare not offend them.  In fact, the longer we treat these people the more we lose. It is best to cure them as quickly as possible, and to give them the best medicines.  Lastly, there is a class who pay in full and in advance, and they should be prevented from getting ill at all, because we are paid a salary to keep them in health."</P><P>The difficulty of obtaining payment for operations in the fourteenth century must have been very great, for De Mondeville still further emphasizes it and says, "The chief object of the patient, and the one idea which dominates all his actions, is to get cured, and when once he is cured he forgets his own obligation and omits to pay; the object of the surgeon, on the other hand, is to obtain his money, and he should never be satisfied with a promise or a pledge, but he should either have the money in advance or take a bond for it.  As the poet says, '<FOREIGN>S&aelig;pe fides data fallit, plegius plaidit, vadium valet</FOREIGN>&mdash;The promise is often broken, the security is worthless, the bond alone holds good.'"  De Mondeville also thinks that it is better on the whole for the surgeon to be paid for what he does rather than by a retaining fee, because a salary is apt to make him so hopeful that he will think the blind can certainly see and the lame can walk or even run.  The surgeon too must beware of those who will make infamous proposals to him, because from time immemorial it has been an article of faith with the common people that every surgeon is a thief, a murderer or a swindler.  He should also be careful to estimate the strength of a patient before he operates.  If a patient dies of the operation and not of mere weakness the surgeon is held excused so long as the friends <PB N="xxiii">think the wound looks healthy, but if the wound looks badly the surgeon is credited with the death even though the patient has simply died of weakness.  The surgeon must not put too much faith in appearances.  The rich have a nasty habit of coming to him in old clothes, or, if they are properly dressed as befits their station they invent all kinds of excuses for beating down his fees.  They say Charity is a flower when they find a man who helps the poor, and think that a surgeon ought to assist the unfortunate, but they never consider that a like rule is binding upon them.  "I often say to such folk," De Mondeville adds, "Well, then, pay me for yourself and for three paupers and I will cure them as well as you.  But they never make any answer, and I have never yet found any one in any position, whether he was a cleric or a layman, who was rich enough, or rather honest enough, to pay what he had promised until he was made to do so."  Lesser surgeons must have fared very badly if this was the experience of the surgeon to the King of France.</P><P>De Mondeville returns to the question of fees in another part of his book (Nicaise, op. cit. p. 199).  "The surgeon ought to consider three things when a patient comes to see him and arrange about the fee for an operation.  First, his own position; secondly, the condition of the patient; thirdly, the state of the disease.  As regards himself the surgeon should think whether he is celebrated or at least better known than his colleagues, whether he is the only surgeon in the country, whether he is rich and not obliged to practise, whether he has enough cases to fill up his time, and whether he is on the point of undertaking more important cases.  On the second point, viz. the condition of the patient.  He either knows or he does not know him; if he knows him he is aware whether he is rich or poor, whether, for example, he is the nephew of a bishop or of an abb&eacute;.  But if he does not know him he ought to make careful inquiries, or rather he ought to get his assistants to make them, because sometimes, indeed often, it happens that the rich come to the leech dressed like paupers.  If the surgeon suspects this he should say to his patient, 'Seigneur, I have examined your case but I must think it over, and I should like to see you again when I have done so, because he who judges in haste repents at leisure,' and in the interval the surgeon should make inquiries.  As to the third point, the surgeon should think of the disease whether it is serious, if it is difficult to cure, and if long attendance will be required, whether few people know how to treat it, if it is chronic, and if it presents any unusual characters.</P><P>"When the surgeon has considered all the points under these three <PB N="xxiv">headings he ought to charge the patient boldly a very large fee, though he may moderate it according to circumstances.  To a rich man he should say, 'The fee a surgeon ought to receive is a hundred pounds for this operation,' and if the patient is staggered by the sum he would continue, 'but I did not say that I was going to charge you that amount,' and thus little by little he lowers his fee.  But he should always have a minimum for each operation and never go below it.  In such cases it is more graceful for him to say, 'I am ready to do this operation as you and your friends wish, but I would rather do it for nothing to please you than for so small a fee.'  And the surgeon should pretend that he has no living (prebende) nor capital except his profession, and that everything is as dear as possible, especially drugs, and ointment; that the fee is as nothing compared with his services; and the wages of all other artisans, masons, for example, have doubled of late.  I repeat that the surgeon ought to charge the rich as much as possible and to get all he can out of them, provided that he does all he can to cure the poor.  You then, Surgeons, if you operate conscientiously upon the rich for a sufficient fee and upon the poor for charity, you ought not to fear the ravages of fire, nor of rain nor of wind; you need not take orders or make pilgrimages nor undertake any work of that kind, because by your science you can save your souls alive, live without poverty and die in your houses.  Live in peace and joy and rejoice because your recompense is so great in heaven, as necessarily follows from the words of the Saviour, spoken in the psalm by the mouth of His prophet, 'Beatus qui intelligit super egeneum et pauperem...' For this reason surgeons enjoy such immunities and are free from all personal service and from all common burdens, such as the repair of walls, moats and roads, from the night watch in towns, and from all kinds of things.  The Surgeons are classed as Surgeon-major and as Surgeons of the palace or Examiners, who are generally called Archiatres by the common people."</P><P>William of Salicet, another surgeon, experienced in war and of the same high standard as Arderne and De Mondeville, had written in 1275 ("<FOREIGN>Chirurgie de Guillaume de Salicet Achev&eacute;e en 1275, Traduction et Commentaire, par Paul Pifteau</FOREIGN>."  Toulouse, 1898, p. 3) in somewhat similar terms.  He says a surgeon should grant the wishes of his patient so long as they do not interfere with the operation.  He ought also to comfort his patient as far as possible by kind actions and by soothing words.  He should hold out hope even in the most desperate cases, because the patient's courage reacts to these words and promises,<PB N="xxv">and they may have a more powerful influence on his recovery than any of the surgeon's remedies.  But the matter should be discussed with the friends whenever there is danger, partly to save them the shock of an unexpected death, and partly to protect the surgeon from any suspicion of having caused it.  Neither a surgeon nor a physician should talk to the women of the house with closed doors, whether she be mistress or servant.  He should never speak improperly to her, nor make eyes at her, especially in the presence of the patient.  Such actions may cause a patient to lose confidence in his surgeon, and thus the operation may prove unsuccessful because the patient has lost the good opinion he had of the operator.  A wise surgeon too will do well to refrain from stealing anything whilst he is in attendance; he will not stir up strife amongst the patient's friends or quarrel with the people of the house; he will be careful, too, not to employ notoriously bad characters as his assistants, for all these things may spoil a good operation and thus detract from the dignity of medicine.  Above all things, he must refrain from becoming too familiar with the laity. They are always ready to speak ill of doctors, and too great familiarity merely means that one cannot demand the proper fees for an operation with any assurance and safety.  It is well known that a large fee increases the authority of the doctor as well as the confidence the patient puts in him, even though the doctor is very ignorant, because it is thought that a large fee secures better attention.  The surgeon ought to observe the rules of those with whom he is living or amongst whom he finds himself.  He should visit the poor because it is a good thing to have a reputation for Charity, partly because it increases his estimation in the eyes of the people, and partly because it enables the Divine Power to extend its influence over his spirit.  The surgeon ought not to allow himself to be swayed by the entreaties of the patient, because if he yields the patient will lose faith in the operator, and the operator may himself become timid and hesitating.  The assistants ought to be amiable and helpful to the patient, and they should never repeat to him what the surgeon has said unless it is pleasant and encouraging.  Leeches should be especially careful not to discuss matters with the patient or in his presence, and above all things, they must avoid whispering or talking together in corners, for such actions rouse all kinds of suspicion in the mind of the patient and his friends.</P><P>Lanfrank, who was in Paris in 1295, and is looked upon as the founder of French surgery, says in the English version transcribed in <PB N="xxvi">1380 (Early English Text Society, No. 102, 1894, p. 8): "Needful it is that a surgeon be of a complexion well proportioned. . . He must have hands well shaped, long small fingers, and his body not quaking.  Also he must be of subtle wit, for all things that (be)longeth to surgery may not with letters be written. . . Be he no glutton, nor not envious nor a niggard; be he true; humble and pleasingly bear himself to his patients; speak he no ribaldry in the sick man's house; give he no counsel but if he be asked; nor speak he with no woman in folly in the man's house; nor chide he not with the sick man nor none of his household, but courteously speak to the sick man, and in all manner of sickness promise him health although you despair of him, but nevertheless tell his friends the truth.  Love no hard cures and undertake no desperate cases.  Help poor men as far as possible and ask good reward of the rich.  Praise he not himself with his own mouth, nor blame he over sharply other leeches.  Love he all leeches and clerics, and, as far as possible, make he no leech his enemy.  So clothe he himself with virtue that he may obtain a good name and a fair reputation.  This is the ethical teaching."</P><P>It is clear from these extracts that Arderne had read Lanfrank's rules for a surgeon, and that he amplified them from his own experience, which corresponded very much with that of the French surgeons who were his contemporaries.  But Arderne's teaching of the duties of a surgeon compares very favourably with that of William Salicet or Henri de Mondeville.  He had a higher moral tone, or, at any rate, he based his warnings on morality rather than upon self-interest, and there is nowhere any reference to a surgeon as a common thief.  His fees are high, but, as a contemporary writer explains, this is to make up for the long periods when he had nothing to do, and it is clear that it was extremely difficult to obtain money from patients.</P><P>Every surgeon was taught never to treat cases which appeared incurable or were unlikely to run a straightforward course.  This was due to ignorance, to the weakness of the law, and to the arbitrary treatment to which individuals might be exposed.  Throughout the Middle Ages, and long afterwards, there was no science of toxicology and very little knowledge of morbid anatomy.  Persons who died suddenly, therefore, were usually thought to have been killed by poison, and the histories of the present day are full of accounts of the deaths of great men who are said to have been poisoned, when it is clear to every medical reader that they died a natural death from some acute disease.  A perforated gastric ulcer, a perforated duodenal ulcer, an acute gangrenous<PB N="xxvii">inflammation of the vermiform appendix would present all the characters of poisoning to the lay mind.  Failure after an operation was liable to be followed by the most undesirable consequences to the leech.  King John of Bohemia, from whose body Edward the Black Prince took an ostrich feather for his crest, sewed up his French leech in a sack and threw him into the Oder because he had not cured his cataract as he had promised.</P><P>Arderne must have led an interesting and adventurous life, and his treatises contain many sidelights on contemporary events.  He appears to be the only contemporary authority for the story of the means by which Edward the Black Prince obtained the ostrich feather which has since become the cognisance of the heir apparent to the English throne.  The passage runs as follows, "We are not able to cure rhagades unless the remedy can be put through the anus either as a clyster or by means of a suppository, since remedies applied outside are either useless or do very little good.  We ought, therefore, to work with stimulating applications until the wound is clean, and afterwards with applications which both heal and dry, as has been said already in the chapter on internal piles, to wit, where Nastar is painted&mdash;and Nastar is a kind of clyster or enema known as a glisterpipe.&mdash;The feather of the Prince of Wales is also shown there, viz. on the preceding page.  And note that Edward the eldest son of Edward King of England bore a similar feather above his crest, and he obtained the feather from the King of Bohemia, whom he killed at Cressy in France.  And so he took the feather which is called an 'ostrich feather,' which that most noble Lord King had used hitherto to bear above his crest.  And in that year when our Lord the strenuous and warlike Prince departed to God, I wrote this little book of mine with my own hand, viz. in the year one thousand three hundred and seventy-six.  And our Lord Edward the Prince died on the sixth June on Trinity Sunday at Westminster during the great Parliament, and may God assoil him, for he was the very flower of chivalry, without peer in the world."<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Rhagades curare non possumus nisi medicinis infra anum inferamus aut in clystere aut modo suppositorii quia medicin&aelig; exterius apposit&aelig; parum vel nihil prosunt, unde primo oportet cum corrosivis operare ad mundificationem et postea cum consolidantibus et desiccantibus ut pr&aelig;dictum est capitulo de h&aelig;morrhoid. infra anum latentibus ubi nastare depingitur et penna Principis Walli&aelig;, viz. folio pr&aelig;cedente.

But it is present in the Latin texts (Sloane MSS. 56, leaf 74; 335, leaf 68; 2002, leaf 333; 176, back; 29301, leaf 42, col. 157; in MS. 1153, leaf 41, in Trin. Coll. Camb.; and in the MS. No. 339 in the Hunterian Library at Glasgow, leaf 77).</P><P>It was from the last MS., which was then called Sloane 2, that Thomas Hearn copied it in the "Chronici Walteri Hemingford."<NOTE>Vol. 2, pp. 444, 446, in note.</NOTE>In each case it is a part of the text, and is written by the same hand as the rest of the manuscript.  The scribes have not copied from each other, and there is very little doubt in my own mind that Arderne wrote it originally, and that it contains the story current in his day about the source of the feather, and Arderne was in a position to obtain the story at first hand.  Incidentally it bears out an interesting point, for it says that both the King of Bohemia and the Prince of Wales bore the feather above his crest, not as his crest, so that it was used in exactly the same manner as was the Garter at first, viz. as an ornament to be worn at jousts or tournaments.<NOTE>"Observations on the Institution of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, by Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas."  "Arch&aelig;ologia," vol. 31, p. 130.</NOTE>  It only became a crest in later years, and so long as it was a mere ornament or distinguishing badge there was no need for it to be associated with a motto; indeed, in each of Arderne's figures the scroll placed upon the quill of the feather, which is single, is left blank instead of being charged.  This use of the ostrich feather as an ornament at jousts further explains the passage in the Black Prince's will, in which he desired that his corpse should be taken through the City of Canterbury as far as the Priory, and that "two war horses, covered with our Arms and two men armed in our Arms and in our crests," should precede his corpse; that is to say, "the one for War, with our entire Arms quarterly, and the other for Peace, with our Badge of Ostrich Feathers," with four banners of the same suite.<NOTE><P>"On the Badge and Mottoes of the Prince of Wales," vol. 3.  "Arch&aelig;ologia," vol. 31, p. 356.</P><P>"<FOREIGN>Et volons qe a quele heure qe notre corps soit amenez parmy la ville de Cantirbirie tantq'a la priorie, q'deux destre&yogh; covert&yogh; de nos arme&yogh;, et deu&yogh; home&yogh; arme&yogh; en nos arme&yogh; et en nos heaumes voisent devant dit n're corps, c'est assavoir l'un pur la guerre de no&yogh; arme&yogh; entiers quartelle&yogh;, at l'autre pur la paix de noz bages des plumes d'ostrace, ove quarter baneres de mesme la sute, et qe chacun de ceaux q'porteront les dite&yogh; baneres ait sur sa teste un chapeau de no&yogh; armes</FOREIGN>."

Arderne directs that the melted diachylon should be allowed to stand without moving by the space of a "pater noster" and an "ave maria."  I asked a patient recently, the Mother Superior of a Convent, how long it would take to repeat these prayers, and she replied about three quarters of a minute.  When I next saw her, after she had spent a sleepless night with a clock in front of her, she said that the question had interested her, and she found that a pater and an ave took exactly half a minute.  Dr. Norman Moore draws attention ("The Progress of Medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital," 1888, p. 13) to a similar method employed by John Mirfeld, a Canon of the priory of St. Bartholomew, who wrote a general treatise on medicine&mdash;<FOREIGN>Breviarium Bartholomei</FOREIGN>&mdash;about the year 1380.  He says, "Mirfeld treated chronie rheumatism by rubbing the part with olive oil.  This was to be prepared with ceremony.  It was to be put into a clean vessel while the preparer made the sign of the cross and said the Lord's Prayer and an Ave Maria, and when the vessel was put to the fire the Psalm, 'Why do the heathen rage,' was to be said as far as the verse 'Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.'  The Gloria, Pater Noster, and Ave Maria are to be said, and the whole gone through seven times.  'Which done let that oil be kept.'" . . . "The time occupied I have tried," says Dr. Norman Moore, "and found to be a quarter of an hour."</P><P>The charm against Cramp (p. 102) was obtained from one who was at Milan when Lionel, Duke of Clarence, married Violante, the daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, at the door of the Cathedral, on June 5th, 1368.  Five months of continuous jousts, feasts and revels were followed by the inevitable consequences of delirium tremens and epileptiform convulsions.</P><P>The sober testimony to the profligacy of the times given in the receipt for making confection of <FOREIGN>Sanguis Veneris</FOREIGN> (p. 89) is the natural outcome of the conditions described in Dr. Furnivall's "Early English Meals and Manners" (Early English Text Society, Original Series, No. 32).  The boys and girls of the upper classes were transferred<PB N="xxx">from their own homes to be educated in the houses of the nobility as pages and maids of honour.  They were well fed, spent their lives in a round of pleasure, and were often badly looked after.</P><P>The account of juniper shows that Arderne knew London and its neighbourhood and talked with the countryfolk as he went amongst them.  He says, "Juniper grows in Kent upon Shooter's Hill on the road to Canterbury, at Dorking also in Surrey as well as in many other places in that County, at Bedington too near Croydon, and the inhabitants of that country call it gorst because they do not know its proper name."<NOTE>"<FOREIGN>Et crescat in cancia super Scheteres hylde in vi&acirc; versus cantuariam, apud Dorkyng, eciam in So&thorn;eray et eciam in aliis pluribus illius provincie, crescit eciam apud Bedyngton iuxta Croyden quam incole patrie illius vocant gorst, quia proprium nomen illius ignorant</FOREIGN>."  (MS. Digby 161, leaf 23, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.)</NOTE>  The Black Death does not seem to have left much impression upon Arderne's mind, because, like most contemporary medical writers, he only mentions it incidentally, and what we look upon as an appalling visitation had already faded from his mind, and its impression had been replaced by more recent epidemics.</P><P>Arderne lived through the most chivalrous period of English history, and in all probability he knew personally many of the peerless knights and splendid champions who survive for ever in the pages of Froissart.  To have known such men was in itself an education, and to have lived in the household of Henry, Duke of Lancaster, and of John of Gaunt was sufficient to make Arderne the best type of an English surgeon&mdash;a scholar and a gentleman.  The chivalry of the age is well brought out in the extant manuscripts of Arderne's treatises.  In some cases he mentions the names of the patients, but in many instances he tricks their coat-armour instead of giving names, and thus some early shields are preserved, amongst others that of the great Douglas.</P><P>Arderne left a few traces on the sands of time, but very few. Johannis Argentin, a physician at Cambridge, wrote a treatise, which still remains in the Bodleian Library as Ashmol. MS. No. 1437. Tanner<NOTE>"Bibliotheca," p. 48.</NOTE> thinks that it was written about 1476.  He mentions Arderne no less than eleven times, and copies his style, especially his manner of quoting cases in illustration of his various subjects.</P><P>Arderne's fame as a pharmacist long outlasted his reputation as a surgeon.  <HI REND="i">Tapsimel</HI> (p. 31), <HI REND="i">Pulvis sine pari</HI> (pp. 26 and 86), <HI REND="i">Tapsivalencia</HI>(p. 69), and the valences of Scabious and Wormwood (p. 97),</P><PB N="xxxi"><P>remained until the time of the first Pharmacop&oelig;ia, 1618.  Dr. Alleyne<NOTE>"A New English Dispensatory," 1733, p. 336.</NOTE> speaks thus of them:&mdash;</P><P>"<HI REND="i">Powers of Scabious, Valentia Scabios&oelig;</HI>.&mdash;Take of the juice of green Scabious, pressed out and strained through a cloth, and of Hog's lard cleared of its membranes, each as much as you please. Let the Lard be beat in a stone mortar, and the juice poured in by little at a time, for the conveniency of mixture, and giving its tincture; and then put them together into a proper vessel, to be exposed to the sun, and so that the juice may cover the lard; after nine days put them again into the mortar as before, and throw away that thin and discoloured humidity, which separates upon beating, without rubbing them together; and again put into its vessel for five days.  And afterwards beat it again and by little at a time, mix with it fresh juice of scabious, and after a fresh insolation of fifteen days in its proper vessel in the Sun, let it be cleared as before of its watery humidity.  Let it then stand again in the same manner for fifteen days longer with fresh juice, and after a little beating let it be kept for use in a glass or earthen vessel.  This, we are told by the first compilers of the College Dispensatory, was the contrivance of John Arden, an experienced surgeon at Newark in Nottinghamshire, who lived in the reign of Edward III.  After insertion of this, which they had from an ancient manuscript, they particularly direct to repeat the processes with fresh juice till the Lard looks of a deep green; and that is made the measure of the repetition necessary.  The powers and honey of Mullein were from the same author, and almost three hundred years ago were in great esteem amongst the surgeons of our own country, though they have now been long in disuse."</P><P>"<HI REND="i">The Powers of Mullein; Tapsi Valentia</HI>.&mdash;Take of the juice of Mullen and of Hog's lard, each as much as you please; let the Lard be cleansed of its membranes and fibres, and broke into small parcels; then beat it with the expressed juice, press out and strain as directed in the preceding process.  Let it afterwards be put into a proper vessel for nine or ten days, and then be twice more impregnated with fresh juice until it is quite green.  Lastly, after all the humidity that will separate is poured off, beat it again briskly, and put it by in a proper manner for use."</P><P>The first contriver of these processes, as appears from the first edition of the College Dispensatory, directs the medicines thus made to be fresh beat once in a month.</P><PB N="xxxii"><P>"<HI REND="i">Honey of Mullen; Tapsimel</HI>.&mdash;Take of the juice of Celandine and one part Mullen, of despumated Honey two parts; boil gradually till the juices are evaporated, adding thereto, if the Operator pleases, calcined Vitriol and Alum with Copperas, and again boil <FOREIGN>secundum artem</FOREIGN>."</P><P>The first College Dispensatory adds from the Author, that "if occasion requires this should be at last boiled up to a pretty thick consistence; and says that it will certainly cure itchings in any part of the body, and is a most noble ointment.  But it seems the present Practice hath not faith enough to rely upon it for anything, for neither this nor the foregoing are ever prescribed or made.  However, it hath been thought fit to continue such extraordinary discoveries still upon record for the sake of any that may think proper to make trial with them."</P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="conclusion"><P>It is my pleasant duty, in conclusion, to thank those who have given me much help in the preparation of this volume.  First, to Dr. Warner, the Keeper of Manuscripts, who allowed me to study the Sloane MSS. at the British Museum in comfort in the room which is doing duty as the large room; secondly, to Mr. L. Galbraith, who afforded me similar facilities in the University Library at Glasgow; and, lastly, to Mr. Falconer Madan, who made me feel at home in the Bodleian.  Lieut.-Col. Walter D. McCaw, Surgeon of the United States Army, responded kindly, promptly and fully to my questions about the only manuscript of Arderne which Dr. Harvey Cushing of Baltimore has been able to obtain tidings of in America.  Miss Evaline G. Parker at Oxford, and Miss Margaret E. Thompson in London, have helped me by transcribing obscure passages which I was quite unable to decipher; whilst my friend, Mr. J. H. Noble, has assisted me with the heraldry of the various MSS., a subject of much interest, which I hope some day to consider in greater detail.  My obligations to Mr. S.  Armitage-Smith are great; and I have endeavoured to show my appreciation of the interest which Dr. Frank Payne has always taken in Arderne, and the help I have received by dedicating to him this edition of his treatises.  I have tried to make the text literally accurate, and to elucidate it by such notes as were needed to explain to myself the various difficulties which occurred in reading it.  No one can be more conscious of the defects in the notes than myself, but the work has been a labour of love, and if they <PB N="xxxiii">seem extremely bad it must be remembered that, after all, I am but a surgeon, whose business in life is to act and not to write.</P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="bibliography"><HEAD>BIBLIOGRAPHY.</HEAD><P>The following table shows the manuscripts which I have examined personally at the British Museum, and in Oxford, Cambridge and Glasgow.  There is said to be a French version in Paris and a Latin one at Stockholm, but I have not yet been able to obtain any information about them: there is a manuscript in Washington and another in Dublin.</P><P>Arderne issued his writings in the form of treatises, written in Latin, and with his own hand.  These treatises were afterwards collected and were sometimes translated.  The manuscripts therefore contain different combinations.  The collection here printed is one of the more usual groups, but the translator has not rendered the whole of the last part on the preparation of various remedies.  It is given in greater detail in the Ashmole MS. 1434 in the Bodleian Library.</P><PB N="xxxiv"><LIST><HEAD>MANUSCRIPTS OF JOHN OF ARDERNE IN THE VARIOUS LIBRARIES.</HEAD><ITEM>I.

When this is found you know the first day of the moon because it is from that hour of the day or night when the conjunction occurs to the same hour of the next day.  Then calculate by the almanac the number of days from the new moon thus obtained to the day you want.  Look next in the previous table where the number is found, and when it is found look in the upper line of the table for the sign in which the moon is.  Coming straight down from this you cross until you come directly to the sign corresponding lineally with the number of the age of the moon, and this gives the sign of the moon on that day.  And note that in this calculation the natural day begins at midday according to the Astronomers.  If any one wishes therefore to be sure of the time let him learn and understand the following table of the 12 signs.  It begins thus&mdash;Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, &amp;c.

For the 12 signs of the Zodiac rule the twelve parts of the human body, as is clear from the aforementioned drawing, where Aries, which is a fiery sign moderately dry, governs the head with its contents.  But when the moon is in Aries beware of operating upon the head or face and do not open one of the head veins.  When the moon is in Taurus refrain from operating upon the neck or throat and do not bleed from a vein in these parts.  When the moon is in Gemini beware of operating on the shoulders, arms or hands, and do not<PB N="18"><FIGURE ENTITY="ArderneFistula-18"><HEAD>[Table for finding the Moon's house.]</HEAD></FIGURE><PB N="19"><PB N="20">open a vein in these parts.  When the moon is in Cancer refrain from operating upon the breasts or chest or stomach and from injuring the lungs, neither open an artery or a vein in their neighbourhood. When the moon is in Leo take care not to injure the flanks or the ribs, and do not operate upon the back either by cutting or by cupping.  When the moon is in Virgo take care not to operate upon the belly or the internal parts, and do not bleed from the veins supplying the womb in women.  When the moon is in Libra refrain from operating upon the navel or upon the buttocks or upon the kidneys, and do not open the vein supplying the kidneys, nor apply a cup.  When the moon is in Scorpio refrain from operating upon the testicles, the penis and the neck of the bladder; do not open the testicular vein and do not apply a cup.  When the moon is in Sagittarius do not operate upon the thighs, do not remove spots or superfluous parts occurring in any part of the human body.

The following charm against spasm has been found most sovran by many who have used it both at home and abroad.  For amongst the Mediolani [i.e.] the Milanese, in Lombardy at the time when the Lord Lionel, son of the king of England, married the daughter of the lord of Milan, the English there were troubled with spasm due to their potations of the strong &amp; hot wines of the country &amp; to too many carouses.  Whereupon a certain knight, the son of Lord Reginald de Grey de Schirlond near Chesterfield, who was at Milan with the Lord Lionel &amp; had with him the following charm, &amp; saw a certain gentleman so troubled with the spasm that his head was drawn backward nearly to his neck just like a crossbow, &amp; he was almost dead from the pain and starvation.  And when the said knight saw this he brought the charm written on parchment &amp; placed it in a purse &amp; put it upon the neck of the patient whilst those who stood by said the Lord's prayer and one to our lady Mary, and, as he swore faithfully to me, within four hours or five he was restored to health.

Ploge seems to be a variant of the more common form plage and is equivalent to 'Plague,' but it is not given in this form in the New English Dictionary.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.4a">1/4. An account of John Arderne is given in the Forewords.  He calls himself Johannes Arderne Sirurgicus in 1372 and Magister Joh. de Arderne after 1376.  I have adopted the simpler form.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.4b">1/4. The first pestilence was the Black Death, which entered England at Weymouth about the middle of August 1348, and ravaged the kingdom in 1349.  It was pandemic, and yet, in spite of the tremendous mortality which attended its progress, it does not seem to have attracted much attention from the medical men who lived through it.  Arderne only uses it in this passage as a means of determining the time when he began to practise in Nottinghamshire, yet he must have seen it in its full fury. Details of the Black Death will be found in Creighton's "History of Epidemics in England," vol. i, and in Father Gasquet's "The Great Pestilence now commonly known as the Black Death."  The second pestilence, called the Great Plague, occurred in 1361, and killed amongst others Henry, Earl of Derby and Duke of Lancaster (cf. 1/10).  The third pestilence in 1369 killed his daughter Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.8">1/8. Sir Adam Everyngham.  The Everynghams had long been established at Tuxford.  An Adam de Everyngham went bail for several deerstealers, 36 Hen. III (1251), and Thoroton, in the "Antiquities of Nottinghamshire" (ed. 1677, p. 380, col. 2), states that John de Lexington died 41 Hen. III (1256), seized of the manor of Tuxford and hamlet of Warsop, and of the land in Lexington held of Adam de Everyngham.  The Records of the Borough of Nottingham (1155-1399, vol. i, p. 389) note on April 27th, 1330, a grant from Richard, son of Richard de Lameleye dwelling in Lampadidnawe in Wales &hellip; to William de Mekisburg of Nottingham of a messuage in Gedeling and all the land formerly held of Sir Adam de Everyngham in Gedelin, Carleton and Stoke Bardolf.  The Sir Adam de Everyngham treated by John Arderne died 8th Feb., 2 Ric. II (1378-9), and he was probably operated upon not later than 1358.  This treatise on the fistula was written in 1376 (see Forewords, p. xi), so that this passage must have been a later addition to the original manuscript.  The armorial bearings of the Everyngham family are Argent, a fess azure, a label of three points gules.  Thoroton (ed. 1797, vol. 3, p. 207) gives a pedigree of the family of Everyngham.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.10">1/10. Sir Henry, that tyme named Erle of Derby.  He was Henry Plantagenet (1299?-1361), son of Henry, Earl of Lancaster, and his Countess Maud.  Sir Henry was cousin to Edward III who created him Earl of Derby in 1337, Earl of Lincoln in 1349, and Duke of Lancaster in 1351, being the second person in England to be made a Duke.  Sir Henry was one of the original Knights of the Garter, and was looked upon throughout Europe as the very mirror of chivalry, when chivalry was at its height. <PB N="108">Readers of Froissart will recall many of his exploits often in company with that other great Captain, Sir Walter de Manny.  Sir Henry sailed for Antwerp with King Edward III in July 1338, and in 1339, after the great sea fight at Sluys, he was left in prison in Flanders as security for the King's debts.  It may have been at this time that Arderne was practising at Antwerp, if there is any truth in the tradition (see Forewords, p. xii). In 1343 Sir Henry, then Earl of Derby, was sent to Avignon to Pope Clement VI and Alfonzo XI of Castile.  Whilst in Spain he and his fellow ambassador, the Earl of Salisbury, did good service against the Moors at the siege of Alge&ccirc;iras when cannon are said to have been used for the first time.  Arderne treated a Spanish nobleman at Alge&ccirc;iras (Forewords, p. xi).</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.13">1/13. The irregular endings of the technical terms which is noticeable here and in other parts of the MS. (cf. 24/5) is due to the scribe copying them as they stand in the Latin text where the case varies with the construction of the sentence in which it occurs.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n1.14"><P>1/14. Arderne's knowledge of the Gascony campaign is curiously minute and makes it possible that he had actually taken part in it or that he knew the country intimately.  Writing more than thirty years after the event he gives the towns in the order in which they were visited by one of the three divisions into which the Duke of Lancaster, formerly the Earl of Derby, had divided his forces, rather than in the correct geographical order.  The army landed at Bordeaux and captured Bergerac on 24th August, 1345.  The town was granted to Lancaster as a reward for his services but reverted to the crown upon his death.  It came afterwards into the hands of Edward "the Black Prince," and was given by him to John of Gaunt in 1370.  The arms of the town "Deux pattes de griffon sur un champ d'or" may still be seen emblazoned in the Great Crowcher Book of the Duchy of Lancaster, says Mr. Armitage-Smith in his "John of Gaunt" (p. 199).</P><LIST><ITEM><P>Toulouse.

Balne is 5 1/4 miles from Snaith, a small town in the West Riding of Yorkshire.  There was a priory at Snaith belonging to the Warwick family.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.1">2/1. John Schefeld of Bri&yogh;twell a-side Tekyll.  This John was probably a member of the knightly family of Sheffield of Nottingham.  The manor of Tickhill was granted to John of Gaunt in 1372 with other rewards for surrendering the Earldom and Honour of Richmond, which was immediately <PB N="109">bestowed upon John de Montford to secure his allegiance then wavering between England and France.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.2">2/2. Sir Reginald Grey de Wilton, also known as Grey de Shirlond or De Grey.  He was the fourth Lord de Grey and was aged 30 in 1342.  He died in 1370, and held the manor of Shirland, co. Derby.  His grandfather John, Lord de Grey, was Justice of North Wales and Vice-Justice of Chester 1296-97.  Sir Reginald Grey's son, the fifth Lord de Grey, served in Gascony in 1366.  The peerage became extinct in 1614 when the fifteenth Lord de Grey died in the Tower after having been found guilty of high treason in connection with the Bye or Priest's Plot.  The Calendar of Close Rolls (Ed. III, 1354-1360, No. 1358) gives the names of Sir Reynold de Grey and John Arderne as witnesses to an enrolment of release by Roger de Puttenham, knight of the manor of Wylye, co. Warwick.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.5">2/5. Sir Henry Blakborne.  A Sir Henry de Blakeburn, son of William, son of Paulinus de Eleston of the County of Lancaster, obtained "a general pardon for his good service in the war of France &hellip; on condition that he did not withdraw from the King's service so long as he shall stay this time on this side the sea without his special licence." The pardon is granted by K and the testimony of Adam de Swynburn, under-constable of the Army.  It is dated "By Calais, September 4th, 1346."  There also exists a ratification of the estate of a Henry de Blakeburn as prebendary of Preston, in the church of St. Mary, Salisbury.  It bears the date September 22nd, 1351.  On May 7th, 1379, "Henry de Blakeburn was presented to the church of Reddcleve-on-Soar by John de Wynewyk, and has since resigned it."  ("Cal. of Patent Rolls," Ed. III, viii, 496; ix, 137; and Rich. II (1377-1381), p. 363.)</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.10">2/10. The transcriber has left out a line here.  The text runs, "Afterward I halid Sir Iohn Masty parsone of Stopporte in Chestre-shire."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.11">2/11. Gunnas or Gunnays was a York family in the fourteenth century. Thomas Gunnays was a scrivener in 1363-4; John Gunnays a Tannator in 1389-90, and there was also John, a Marchaunt.  ("Register of York Freemen," The Surtees Soc., vol. i, 1896.)</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.13">2/13. The scribe has made a mistake in the name.  John le Colier was Mayor of Northampton in 1326-7, and again in 1339-40.  He seems to have been a most regular attendant at the meetings of the Town Council, because his name appears as a witness to thirty-three documents between the years 1315 and 1340.  ("Records of the Borough of Nottingham," vol. i, 1155-1399.)  A William Colyar was Mayor of Northampton 1368-9.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n2.29">2/29. Towel.  Arderne's translator uses somewhat unusual terms for the parts with which he is dealing.  The towel is always the Anus.  It is, I suppose, a form of "tewel," a pipe or funnell, and the word has survived in the North of England as a "tuyer" in connection with the blast furnaces. Longanon or Longaon is the ordinary medi&aelig;val word for the rectum or lowest segment of the large intestine.  The Lure is sometimes the ischiorectal fossa, and sometimes the anus or rectum. The "Promptorium Parvulorum" gives "Mouth of a botel," "Lura," or Leather bagge, adds the Bibliotheca Eliot&aelig;, ed. 1559.  The New English Dictionary, s.v. Lure, 2 Her(aldic), says, "A conventional representation of a hawk's 'lure,' consisting of two birds' wings with the points directed downwards and joined above by a ring attached to a cord."  Either of these similes suits the anatomy of the ischio-rectal fossa, but it is clearly the simpler one that was in Arderne's mind, as he did not know enough anatomy to visualise the ischio-rectal fossa in accordance with the hawk's lure.  Cf. 11/10.</NOTE><PB N="110"><NOTE ID="n2.40">2/40. The opinions of Arderne's immediate contemporaries and predecessors on the subject of Fistula in ano are given in the Forewords (p. xvi).</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.8">3/8. The translation quite misses the beauty of this passage, which should read, "It is not opened to them that knock as they pass by, but to those who stand and knock."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.13">3/13. In diuanudiis.  These words have proved a crux from the earliest times.  Some scribes have merely copied the words here printed, others have omitted them entirely.  John Arderne clearly wrote a very bad hand, but Miss E. M. Thompson has made the following transcription of Sloane MS. No. 29301 (leaf 22, back, col. 80), which was presumedly a fair copy produced under Arderne's immediate supervision&mdash;"<FOREIGN>Nota de honore dei.  Ad honorem ergo dei omnipotentis qui aperuit mihi sensum ut thesaurum in agro studenter absconditum quod longo tempore pectoreque anelo diligencius ac pertinacius diu auidius insuadaverim invenire prout mea suppetat facultas absque scernatis facunditate posteris, domino mediante istoque libello, explicite duxi exarandus.  Non ut meipsum laude dignum ex tanto munere ceteris efferam sed, ut ne dom&kgr;inum irretem et pro dragma quam mihi tradidit affatu urgeor delatoris</FOREIGN>."  The badly written words "diu avidius" in this passage were soon corrupted into "in diuanudiis," the "in" being an interpolation.  "In diuanudiis" easily became "De Dinamidiis," the name of a spurious work ascribed to Galen, and thus Arderne acquired an undeserved reputation as a Grecian.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.23">3/23. The transcriber has omitted the line, "&thorn;at is leful forso&thorn; to sey that is knowen &amp; for to witness that is seene."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.27">3/27. This was the Black Prince's campaign in 1355.  It lasted eight weeks, and was of a freebooting character.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.34">3/34. Yet John Arderne thought it wise to obtain the Minorite's secret. "<FOREIGN>Il ne r&eacute;v&egrave;le son secret (en 1370) que parce qu'il est vieux et qu'il a tir&eacute; des tr&egrave;s-beaux b&eacute;n&eacute;fices</FOREIGN>," says Daremberg (Hist. des. Sci. m&eacute;d. i, 301, note).</NOTE><NOTE ID="n3.36">3/36. It is unnecessary to show the debt of the medical profession in the middle ages to Galen, who was born at Pergamos about A.D. 131. Arderne probably quotes Galen through a Latin translation of an Arabic version.  He knows him as the author of the Megatechni or De methodo medendi&mdash;&THgr;&egr;&rgr;&agr;&pgr;&egr;&ugr;&tgr;&igr;&kgr;&eecirgr;&sfgr; &mgr;&egr;&thgr;&oacugr;&dgr;&ogr;&ugr;&mdash;and of the Microtechni, or simply the Techni or Tegni which was the ars medica or &tgr;&eacugr;&khgr;&ngr;&eegr; &ismogr;&agr;&tgr;&rgr;&igr;&kgr;&eegragr;.  The Pantechni or Pantegni used here by Arderne was not one of Galen's writings.  It was written in Arabic by Isaac the Jew (d. 932 A.D.), and was translated into Latin by Constantinus Africanus (fl. 1036 A.D.), who issued it as his own. Cf. 55/3.  Prof. Ed. Nicaise ("La Grande Chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac," Paris, 1890, p. 52) says that in 1309 the Faculty of Medicine at Montpellier demanded that each bachelor who wished to become a Master must have studied the following books of Galen, "<FOREIGN>De complexionibus; de malicia complexionis diverse; De simplici medicina; De crisi et criticis diebus; De Ingenio sanitatis</FOREIGN>."  He had also to explain two books which had been lectured upon and one which had not been commented upon, of the Techni and Prognostics, or of the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, or of his Regimen, or the Isagoge of Johannitius, the Febres of Isaac, or the Antidotary of Rhazes.  See Dr. Payne on Medical Books in use at Montpellier, Rashdall's "Universities of Europe," Vol. 2, part ii, page 780.  The fact that Arderne knew and quotes all these writers lends some support to the theory that he was educated at Montpellier.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n4.2">4/2. These passages on the Manner or Behaviour of a Leech form the true joy of those who travail amongst the old Masters of Medicine and <PB N="111">surgery.  They are full of conceits, and give a picture of contemporary manners and customs which it is impossible to obtain in any other way. The parallel passages from Salicet, Mondeville and Lanfrank are given in the Forewords (xix-xxvi), and show that there was a common source for these paragraphs on medical ethics of which the chief was "De adventu medici" of Archimattheus, a master at Salerno.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n4.24">4/24. The expression "for why" is employed by the translator as the English equivalent for the Latin word "Nam."  It does not imply a question therefore, but is used as we should now say "because."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n5.8">5/8. The greeting of ladies by thrusting the hands into their bosom had a long vogue in England, and it would be interesting to know whether the fashion of wearing low-necked dresses was a cause or an effect of the custom.  By the end of the seventeenth century it was only used by near relatives, and Mr. Samuel Pepys records that he availed himself of the privilege.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n6.4a">6/4. Speaking of the cure of scabies by the inunction of a mercurial ointment (MS. Ashmol. 1434, leaf 131; cf. 79/1), Arderne says, "I have tried it many times and have made a good deal of money from it, and I got twenty shillings for a single application.  And take notice that the inunction must be repeated for forty days, or for a month at least. ("<FOREIGN>Quod centies probavi et exinde multa lucra adquisivi pro certo et haec xxs. pro uno liserio.  Et nota quod tale lisorium per xl dies vel mensem ad minus debet portari</FOREIGN>.")</NOTE><NOTE ID="n6.4b">6/4. The fees charged by Arderne are very large, if it be remembered that money had at least seventeen times and perhaps twenty times its present value.  I have given some account of the fees of our ancestors in Janus (May-June 1909, pp. 287-293), and to the facts there contained I may add an observation obtained by Prof. Ed. Nicaise for his edition of Guy de Chauliac's Surgery (op. cit. p. lxii).  "A lady was attended in 1348 by three doctors, two Jews and a Christian, and she paid a fee of half a florin to each.  The livre tournois at this time was equivalent to one florin and 16 sols of pontifical money&mdash;the cash then current at Avignon&mdash;and corresponded to 27 francs 34 centimes of modern French money.  The general practitioner therefore received 8 francs 17 centimes for each visit, which is equivalent to three visits for a guinea."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n6.5">6/5. The custom of paying for an operation by an annuity as well as by a fee lingered in England until late in the seventeenth century, for Richard Wiseman (1622?-1676), speaking of a patient, says, "This person retired into the country afterwards and returned to London at the end of two years, and acknowledged to me his cure by settling thirty pounds a year upon me during his life and paid me sixty pounds for the two years passed."  Readers of French history, too, will recollect that Louis XIV paid Dr. Fran&ccirc;ois Felix the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds and settled a farm upon him in 1686 for curing him of a fistula.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n7.29">7/29. "The Senator Boetius," says Gibbon, "is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman." ("Roman Empire," ed. 1862, v, 27.)  He was born at Rome about 475 A.D. and was consul in 510.  He was a minister of Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, who displaced the Emperor Odoacer.  Boethius was afterwards imprisoned at Pavia and was put to death in 525 A.D.  He was subsequently canonised as St. Severinus.  He wrote the "De consolatione Philosophi&aelig;" (Chaucer's translation of which was published in the Early English Text Soc.'s Extra Series, No. V, 1868), as well as some valuable treatises on <PB N="112">Music and Geometry.  The "de disciplina scholarium" mentioned in the text is falsely ascribed to Boetius.  It is quoted again 23/27.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n7.39">7/39. Arderne repeatedly draws attention to the effect of the mind on the body, and makes it appear that what we now call neurasthenia was not unknown in his experience.  Cf. 6/23, 8/3, 60/16, 64/32.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n8.27">8/27. The operation of fistula recommended by Arderne is described in the Forewords (p. xvii) to this volume.  Arderne purposely gives fancy names to the instruments and to the remedies he uses as part of a fixed design to keep his methods secret.  This secrecy was a common feature of the medical profession until quite recently&mdash;indeed it still lingers in parts where medical men dispense "our ointment" or "our linctus."  Arderne especially feared the competition of other leeches, cf. 15/9 and 30/3, of the Barbers, cf. 71/16, and of the laity, cf. 103/3, for when he used the charm against tic, tetanus and delirium tremens, he not only disguised the words in Greek characters but he made nonsense of them, "ne a laicis perspicietur."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n8.29">8/29. The sequere me was a flexible probe, and was named appropriately enough because it was the guide to be followed.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n9.4">9/4. The acus rostrata, or "snowted needle," was a grooved director along which the scalpel was passed.  The snowted or curved end fitted into a hole in the cochlearia or shield which was introduced later in the operation to protect the opposite side of the rectum at the moment the fistula was divided.  This snouted needle was made of silver.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n9.12">9/12. The tendiculum, or dilator, made of boxwood, was used chiefly to keep the ligature taut whilst the fistula was being divided.  For this purpose it was provided with a hole into which fitted (9/16) the wrayste or "vertile," much in the same way that the peg fits into a violin.  The ends of the ligature were passed round the wrayste, which was then twisted until the fr&aelig;num c&aelig;saris was tight enough.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n9.20">9/20. The fr&oelig;num C&oelig;saris, or ligature, constricted the rectal side of the fistula.  It seems to be merely a vestigium of an obsolete operation for the cure of fistula.  Albucasis used it as an &eacute;craseur, and Arderne had sufficient reverence for authority not to discard it.  But the operation he describes is one of simple division.  The tendiculum, the wrayste and the fr&aelig;num C&aelig;saris, therefore, are useless because as soon as the division was complete, they all fell out of the wound.  Cf. 24/26.  They steadied the parts whilst the incision was made, but they complicated the operation by giving the surgeon two instruments to hold in his left hand (the acus rostrata and the tendiculum) whilst he held the scalpel in his right hand. The cochlearia must always have been held by the assistant&mdash;the fellow of the leech&mdash;as Arderne calls him,&mdash;the surgeon's mate&mdash;as the Elizabethans knew him.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n9.24">9/24. The siringa is probably only a clyster-pipe.  Two forms are given, the one with side-openings, as was then used, the other an improved form recommended by Arderne as the result of his own experience (cf. 74/38) in which there is only a single terminal orifice.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.1">11/1. Aposteme is an early form of the word which afterwards became Imposthume.  It means a suppurating inflammation or an abscess.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.6">11/6. Arderne's pathology of fistula is excellent and is clearly the result of observation.  He has seen and treated cases of ischio-rectal abscess, and has observed how such abscesses have become chronic and ended in a fistula.</NOTE><PB N="113"><NOTE ID="n11.18">11/18. The axillary glands were the emunctories of the heart: the inguinal glands of the liver: the cervical glands of the brain.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.19">11/19. Chawelle&yogh; is quite an unusual word, and except for the Latin version it would be incomprehensible.  The Latin gives the English gloss "fauces."  It seems, therefore, to be a form derived from the same source as "Chawylbone" which the Promptorium Parvulorum renders Mandibula.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.20">11/20. Gilbertyn is Gilbert the Englishman, known to all readers of Chaucer because he is named in the Prologue (1. 429) with Bernard and Gatesden.  Gilbertus Anglicus flourished about 1210, and is said to be the first practical English writer on medicine though Master Richard preceded him.  Dr. Payne in his Fitzpatrick lectures in 1904 says that Theodoric took his description of leprosy from Gilbertyn, a description evidently at first hand and in many respects very accurate.  Gilbert wrote a compendium or Laurea of medicine, printed at Lyons 1510 (cf. 55/10), and a Commentary upon the verses of Gilles de Corbeil "De Urinis" (cf. 59/32).  A commentary in English upon these same verses and attributed to John Arderne exists in manuscript in the Hunterian Library at Glasgow (No. 328).</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.21">11/21. Ol. roset.  Oil of roses entered largely into the medi&aelig;val pharmacop&oelig;ia as a soothing application.  The ceruse here ordered to be mingled with it is carbonate of lead, and the litharge is protoxide of lead. The lotion thus had the soothing and astringent properties which is still attributed to lead lotion or Goulard extract.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.24">11/24. Wombe.  Arderne speaks consistently of the belly as the womb both in men and women; when he speaks specifically of the womb in women he employs the term Marice.  Cf. pp. 80/39, 85/4 and 86/26.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.27">11/27. Arderne, like his contemporaries, recognises two forms of Mallow.  The Alth&aelig;a rosea&mdash;which he calls "tame" mallow (cf. 12/15), because it was grown in the garden, and Malva silvestris&mdash;the wild mallow.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n11.32">11/32. A Nastar of tree.  Arderne fortunately gives the English equivalent for Nastar in the manuscript No. 112 (T. 5, 14), fol. 77, contained in the Hunterian Library, Glasgow, and says, "Nastare species est clysteris sive enematis 'a glister pipe.'"  A Nastar of tree, therefore, is a wooden enema nozzle.  The wood may be either boxwood, hazel or willow.  His description of the bladder and its method of preparation is given later on; cf. 75/1 et seqq.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n12.1">12/1. After auctores.  The author is probably Serapion the younger who wrote a large work on pharmacology, which was translated from Arabic into Latin under the title "Liber de medicamentis simplicibus" or "De temperamentis simplicium."  He lived about the end of the eleventh century.  For Serapion the elder see 55/29, p. 124.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n12.9">12/9. Diaquilon.  Three forms of diachylon plaster were used.  One called Rhazes' plaster; a second Mesue's, and the third diachylon commune. Arderne here recommends Mesue's diachylon which contained mucilage of Alth&aelig;a and oil of camomile amongst many other ingredients.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n12.15">12/15. M.  The symbol M. is used for Manipulus in dispensing drugs&mdash; a handful&mdash;and the handful was either large or small.  The small handful or pinch was denoted by the letter P. for Pugillus, and it was usually estimated at about the eighth part of the Manipulus.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n12.21a">12/21. Lana succida is sufficiently described in the text.  It seems to have been a crude method of obtaining what is now called lanolin.  An undressed fleece is still used in folk-medicine.</NOTE><PB N="114"><NOTE ID="n12.21b">12/21. The persistence of these simple remedies is shown by Miss Edith Durham's interesting account of Higher Albania (Lond. 1909, p. 93).  She says, speaking of a comminuted fracture of the leg treated by an old Franciscan at Vukli:&mdash;"He then plugged and dressed the wound with a salve of his own making&mdash;the ingredients are extract of pine resin, the green bark of elder twigs, white beeswax and olive oil.  The pine resin would provide a strong antiseptic. The property of the elder bark I do not know.&hellip; In gunshot wounds he was very expert.  For 'first aid' his prescription was: Take the white of an egg and a lot of salt, pour on to the wound as soon as possible and bandage.  This only temporary till the patient could be properly treated with rakia (the local alcoholic drink) and pine salve as above.  The wound was to be plugged with sheep's wool, cleaned and soaked in the salve.  The dressing to be changed at night and morning and at midday also if the weather be very hot.  Should the wound show signs of becoming foul, wash again with rakia as often as necessary.  This treatment he had inherited from his grandfather who had it from his.  The exact proportions and way of making salve he begged to be excused from telling me as they were a family secret."  Every word of this passage would have been approved by Arderne.  He would have recognised his Unguentum sambuci (cf. 30/21), the egg medled (cf. 28/4) with salt would have been nothing new to him, the cleaning of the sheep's wool he might have considered an improvement upon his own lana succida (cf. 12/20), as he had an open mind (cf. 35/4), and he would have endorsed thoroughly the old priest's disinclination to give away the secret of a preparation (cf. 15/8).</NOTE><NOTE ID="n12.40">12/40. Wormed, i. e. warmed.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n13.20">13/20. Ragadie&yogh; was the name given to fissures formed round the anus and vulva.  It is used here to denote chronic ulceration.  Frousinge&yogh; seems to be a mere repetition of ragadie&yogh;, as it does not occur in the Latin texts.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n13.24">13/24. An ulcus undesiccable is an ulcer which continues to form pus in spite of treatment.  Medi&aelig;val surgeons were very skilful in frightening themselves with names.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n14.4">14/4. There were two Geoffrey Scropes living in the latter half of the fourteenth century.  (i) Sir Geoffrey Scrope, knighted before Paris, 1360. He was the eldest son of Sir Henry le Scrope of Masham, Co. York, the first Lord Scrope, who was Governor of Guisnes and Calais in 1360.  This Geoffrey Scrope was slain at Piskre, Lithuania, in 1362 (cf. 67/34).  (ii) Sir Geoffrey le Scrope, son of Stephen, second Lord Scrope, who was living in 1409, but had died sine prole before 1418.  The brother of this Geoffrey le Scrope was Stephen le Scrope, Archdeacon of Richmond in Yorkshire, who died September 5, 1418.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n14.20">14/20. It is clear from this and the following lines that Arderne had seen and noted cases of ur&aelig;mia following upon long-continued urethral fistul&aelig;.  The headache, giddiness, dull pain in the loins and vomiting which occur during the later stages of renal disease are all duly noted.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n14.38">14/38. Bernard de Gordon was teaching at Montpellier in 1285, and was living in 1318.  He wrote the "Lilium medicin&aelig;," but Arderne here shows that he was absolutely ignorant of Anatomy.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n15.8">15/8. This is another good instance of the secrecy which characterised the practice of surgery at this period.  It was still a trade to be taught, and it was many years before it became a profession to be learned.  (Cf. 8/25 and 71/15.)</NOTE><PB N="115"><NOTE ID="n16.4">16/4. It would have been impossible for Arderne to have escaped the belief in Astrology which was a feature of his time.  He gives the usual table, common to all his contemporaries, for finding the house of the moon on any given day, and he thought that the planets had an influence upon the twelve parts of the body which correspond to the signs of the zodiac.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n16.7"><P>16/7. Ptholomeus was Ptolemy the physician, who lived at Alexandria in the third century B.C., and was perhaps identical with Ptolemy the Geographer.  De Mondeville quotes Ptolemy the physician and refers to his "Centilegium"; Guy de Chauliac also speaks of his "Centiloquium." Pictagoras was Pythagoras the Greek philosopher, born about 582 B.C. He was steeped in the mystical lore of Egypt and India; a vegetarian and a social reformer, his name is chiefly associated with the doctrine of Metempsychosis.</P><P>Rasis is Ab&uacute; Becr Mohammed Ibn Zacariy&aacute; Ar-R&aacute;z&iacute;, commonly known as Rhazes.  He was born in 850 A.D. and died about 932.  He was the first great Arabian physician, and his text-book called the "Continent" was only displaced by the work of Haly Abbas.  Rhazes is still interesting to us because he first distinguished clearly between Smallpox and Measles.</P></NOTE>
<NOTE ID="n16.8">16/8. Haly is Haly the Arabian physician who died in 994 A.D.  He wrote the "Royal Book" which displaced Rhazes' text-book, and was in turn displaced by the Canon of Avicenna.  Cf. 56/7, p. 124.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n21.2">21/2. Arderne's account of fistulate or festred gout makes its probable that he is describing the condition which is now known as chronic inflammation of the bone due to infective micro-organisms.  Sophocles described Philoctetes as suffering from a similar condition.  Cf. 46/25.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n21.9">21/9. Ypocras, i. e. Hippocrates, lived during the golden age in Greece (460-377 B.C.), and was contemporary with Socrates.  His writings were known through Galen's commentaries upon the Prognostics, Aphorisms, and on Regimen in Acute Diseases, which had been translated into Latin before the fourteenth century.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n21.27">21/27. The meaning of this passage may be thus rendered, "Take heed lest thou art so blinded by the desire for money as to operate upon a case thou knowest to be incurable."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n22.12">22/12. Lusting is here equivalent to grudging.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n22.17">22/17. The details of the operation are admirably given, and it is quite possible to follow each step, a very rare thing in the case of medi&aelig;val writers on surgery, but Arderne was a master of this part of his subject.

Arderne shows his ability by recommending a cutting operation. It proves that he was not afraid of the bleeding which daunted his contemporaries and many of his successors.  Cf. 24/32.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n23.21">23/21. Both John Arderne and Henri de Mondeville were never tired of repeating that surgery was an art to be learnt by practice.  It was too much the custom of the time to rely upon authority and to think that everything could be learnt from books.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n23.27">23/27. Boece.  Cf. 7/29.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n24.5">24/5. Freno cesaris; 24/9. frenum cesaris.  Cf. 1/13, p. 108.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n24.21">24/21. Arderne gives a choice of two cutting instruments, a razor and a lancet.  Dr. Stewart Milne ("Surgical Instruments in Greek and Roman Times," Oxford, 1907, p. 31) describes a form of razor in which "a scalpel <PB N="116">blade is mounted on a ring and the fore-finger is passed through the ring." Such a razor would have suited Arderne's purpose admirably, but he used some form of scalpel.  "Lanceola," says Dr. Freind ("The History of Physic," part 2, p. 177), "in its proper genuine signification is no older than Julius Capitolinus, how long it has been applied to signify a surgical instrument I cannot tell; however, it may be traced as high at least as the time of William of Bretagne, who lived in 1220 and wrote the history of Philip August, whose chaplain he was."  He gives some account of the lanceola, and distinguishes it very plainly from the Phlebotomus, both which instruments we see were made use of in that age.  "<FOREIGN>Lanceola dicitur subtile ferrum acutum, cum quo minutores aliqui pungendo venam aperiunt in minutione.  Aliqui cum Phlebotomo venam percutiunt</FOREIGN>."  (Lanceola is a name given to a delicate pointed instrument with which some bleeders open a vein by puncturing it in bleeding.  Others breathe a vein with a phlebotome.)  (Cf. 61/23.)</NOTE><NOTE ID="n24.29">24/29. Arderne here shows that he knows the last thing a surgeon learns&mdash;the knowledge when to stop in operating.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n24.32">24/32. Surgeons had no satisfactory instruments for stopping bleeding until pressure forceps were invented by Sir Spencer Wells about 1884. Many devices were tried and had their day, but h&aelig;morrhage remained the bugbear of every operating surgeon, and the fear of its occurrence limited the scope of his work.  Arderne here recommends the excellent, simple and cleanly method of sponge pressure to arrest the immediate h&aelig;morrhage, and afterwards uses a styptic powder.  Arderne gained a great reputation for his prescriptions (cf. Forewords p. xxxi), and it is evident that he was a good physician as well as a practical surgeon; cf. pp. 97 and 98.  The styptics here recommended were all in common use.  Boli is Bolus armeniacus, a yellow earth containing oxide of iron.  Sanguis draconis was the resin obtained from the fruit of the Calamus draco.  Aloes epaticus: the medi&aelig;val materia medica recognised socotrin aloes and hepatic aloes which was an inferior quality.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n25.9">25/9. Walwort is either the Sambucus or the Pellitory.  Arderne probably means the Elder, of which it was said "this tree has not one part but is used in Pharmacy."  The juice is still used in the form of Elder wine.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n26.11">26/11. Directions for making sanguis veneris and oil of camomile are given on pp. 89 and 94.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n26.13">26/13.

Bolnyng is equivalent to swelling or swollen.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n27.28">27/28. Alum &yogh;ucarin. combust. is described on p. 81.  Three kinds of alum were recognised: alum glass, alum plume, and alum zuccarin.  Alum glass was the crude alum crystals; alum plume was the natural aluminium sulphate; alum zuccarin. was the re-crystallised form; but alum zuccarin. was also used as a synonym for sugar candy.  The crude alum was sometimes called Alumen roche from the town of Roche in Syria, and as this was often written Alumen R&omacr; it came to be called Alum of Rome.</NOTE><PB N="117"><NOTE ID="n27.30">27/30.

Arderne clearly indicates the calling of an apothecary as distinct from the barbers, surgeons and physicians of the time.  As a surgeon he gathered his own simples and made his own preparations, rather to keep their composition a secret than because he was obliged to do so, for the apothecaries would have made them up for him equally well.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n30.21"><P>30/21. "Smalach," says Dr. R. C. A.

Arderne gives a formula for his unguentum ruptorium (Sloane MS. 29301, leaf 35, col. 1), which is substantially the same as the one mentioned here.  It consists of unslaked lime well mingled with black soap and made into a mass, which was afterwards bound with diachylon upon the part to be destroyed.  Jamerius (cf. 55/3, Rubrica xxi) also gives a formula for a ruptory, "<FOREIGN>De unguento quod ruptorium dicitur. Unguentum forte quod ruptorium dicitur.  &rx;.

(Salmon's "New London Dispensary," 1678, p. 768, col. 2.)  Soap was of two kinds: White soft soap known as French soap, and hard grey soap called Saracenic soap.  The latter is meant when the prescription demands black soap.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n34.4">34/4. Arderne anchored his tents in much the same way as we now anchor drainage tubes in deep wounds by putting a thread through one end.  He uses the word "ground" systematically for "bottom," so that where we should say the bottom of the wound he says (34/6) "in the grounde of the fistula."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n35.15">35/15. Reparaled means the same as re-dressing a wound, that is to say, changing the dressings.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n36.15">36/15. Arderne loved to play upon words.  Cf. 37/12 and 91/32.  He could not resist the pun with "bubo," which is the technical term for an abscess in the axilla or groin, and also means an owl.  Guy makes the same joke (ed. Nicaise, p. 166).  Buboes were the characteristic mark of the bubonic plague, and he must have seen many examples.  In the later epidemics the Searchers recognised the disease by the botch which is a plague token.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n37.6">37/6 et seqq.  Arderne gives a most creditable account of cancer of the rectum, and distinguishes it clearly from dysentery.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n37.29">37/29.

Both time and knowledge are then lost, to the great detriment of the patient.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n39.8">39/8.

Women held a well-recognised position as practitioners of medicine in the Middle Ages, and several of the matron&aelig; or mulieres Salernitan&aelig; attained renown at the School of Salernum.  The best known is Trotula de Ruggiero, who wrote "de mulierum passionibus."  But Arderne seems to allude here to the "ladies bountiful" of his time, for whom he had no great regard.  Guy de Chauliac puts them last of his five sects of medical practitioners.  The first contained Roger, Roland and the Four Masters who treated wounds with poultices; the second, like Bruno and Theodoric, used dressings of wine and dried up the wounds; the third included William Salicet and Lanfrank, who occupied, he says, a position intermediate between the other two sects.  The fourth class embraced those who had been trained on the battlefield, and for whom <PB N="120">Arderne had a sneaking regard; they treated their wounds with charms, oil and wool, and said that God has given virtue to words, herbs and stones (cf. 104/15); whilst the fifth class consisted "of women and many idiots who refer all their sicknesses to the Saints."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n45.1">45/1.

It was an ancient preparation composed of germander, agaric, colocynth, Arabian st&aelig;chas, opoponax, sagapenum, parsley, aristolochia, white pepper, cinnamon, lavender, myrrh and honey.  It was used in melancholy, hydrophobia and epilepsy.  This was known as Antiochi hiera.  There was also a theriacum of Antiochus which was also an antidote to every kind of poison.

The Spathomele or spatula probe is the commonest of the classical surgical instruments.  It consists of a long shaft with an olivary point at one end and a spatula at the other.  The olive end was used for stirring medicaments and the spatula for spreading them, when it was employed in pharmacy.  But it was so handy that it was often used as a blunt dissector, as Arderne did in this case.  It was also used by painters for preparing and mixing their colours.  See Dr. Milne, "Surgical Instruments in Greek and Roman Times," p. 58.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n48.32">48/32. Ventose.

The first case seems to be one of thrombosis.  The vena epatica is the vena hepatica of the arm and not of the liver.  The vein arises on the back of the hand near its ulnar edge, taking origin from the plexus on the back of the hand and fingers.  It ascends to the ulnar side of the forearm, where it is called the anterior cubital vein.  It was known to medi&aelig;val anatomists as the Salvatella (cf. 61/22), that on the right side being the salvatella hepatica, and the vein on the left arm the salvatella splenetica. In like manner the external saphenous vein was known as the salvatella pedis aut saphena.  William of Salicet (Ed. Pifteau, p. 459) describes them carefully, saying, "<FOREIGN>Saluatella, hepatica in manu dextra, et splenetica in manu sinistra, quae est inter digitum annularem et auricularem.&hellip; Salutella pedis aut saphena</FOREIGN>."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n50.1">50/1.

The first thing perhaps that strikes us is the number of books to which he had access.  Books during his lifetime were a luxury of the rich, and those who know the early history of the University of Oxford will remember the gratitude with which the gifts of books from Duke Humphry and the Duke of Bedford were received from 1439 onwards, as "life-giving showers wherewith the vineyard was rendered fruitful, and from which an abundant supply of oil from the olive trees of the University might be expected."  Arderne may, of course, have spent his fees in buying MSS. just as some of us do at the present day, but it is probable that he had access to the Libraries of his patrons like John of Gaunt, who were men of letters as well as of affairs, and he was thus able to quote verbatim et literatim, as in the present instance.</P><LIST><ITEM><P>Lanfrank of Milan, as has been said (cf. Forewords, p. xxv), was a pupil of William de Salicet.  He was one of the great teachers of Surgery at Paris, and died in 1306.  The "Chirurgia magna" was issued in 1295-6 as an enlarged edition of the "Chirurgia parva" published in 1270.  He taught that Anatomy was the foundation of Surgery.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Bernard of Gordon was Professor at Montpellier, where he began to teach in 1285, and published his "Lilium medicin&aelig;" in 1305.  The words <PB N="123">quoted by Arderne are printed in the 1542 edition of the "Lilium" as the first words of the Preface.  Arderne gives the date as 1303.  The Lyons and Paris editions both give it 1305.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Master Bartholomew of Salernum was a pupil of Constantinus Africanus late in the eleventh century.  Arderne is mistaken in ascribing the "Passionarius" to him.  The book, which is often called the "Passionarius Galeni," was really written by Gariopontus, a teacher at Salernum early in the eleventh century.  The edition printed at Basel in 1531 gives the authorship correctly, but the Lyons edition in 1526 calls it Galen's.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Master Richard seems to be Richard the Englishman already mentioned. Cf. 11/20, p. 113.  He was also called Ricardus senior, and was a Master at Salerno at the end of the twelfth century.  He also lived in France and in England.  His book, "Micrologus," is a collection of short treatises written at different times: (1) Practica, (2) De Urinis, (3) Anatomia, (4) Repressiva, (5) Prognostica.  Taken alone Micrologus would probably refer to the "Practica."  None of Richard's works have been printed.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Master Roland was from Parma, and he edited in 1264 the "Practica Chirurgi&aelig;," which was written by Master Roger in 1180.  Roger's book was sometimes called "Rogerina," or "Rogerina major, medius et minor." It was often attributed to Roger Bacon.  This was the text-book upon which the Four Masters wrote their celebrated Commentary.  "Roger and Roland," says Sir Clifford Allbutt ("The Historical Relations of Medicine and Surgery," Lond. 1905, p. 27), "stand like Twin Brethren in the dawn of modern medicine bearing the very names of romance.  Roger's book was no mere cooking of Albucasis.  Before Theodoric, Roger refractured badly united bones.  For h&aelig;morrhage he used styptics, the suture or the ligature; the ligature he learned no doubt from Paul."</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Master Guido is Guy de Chauliac, the contemporary of Arderne, for he flourished in the second half of the fourteenth century.  Guy took orders and was physician to Pope Clement VI at Avignon; Arderne with a bias towards religion remained a layman.  Both were Master surgeons.  Guido held with Lanfrank that Anatomy was the basis of Surgery; Arderne drifted towards drugs, words and charms, and knew no anatomy.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Roger de Barone or de Varone is credited with a treatise "Summa Rogerii," or "Practica parva."  The date is disputed, but it was probably written at Montpellier late in the thirteenth century.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>Johannice is Johannitius Honein Ben Ishak (809-873), the son of a Christian Apothecary, and one of the great translators of medical works from Greek into Arabic.

John Damascene is the name under which the fourteenth-century writers on surgery concealed the identity of the elder Serapion, who lived in the ninth century.

Avicenna, the Prince of Science, was born near Bokhara in 980 A.D. and early showed his precocity, for he knew the Koran and several books of philosophy by heart when he was ten years old.  His genius turned first to law, but at the age of 16 he had made such progress in medicine as to warrant his appointment as personal physician to the Sultan Ben Mansur. "Wein, Weib und Gesang" killed him at the age of 57, in June 1037, but not before he had written his "Canon," which was translated into Latin in the twelfth century and remained a text-book until the middle of the seventeenth century.</NOTE><NOTE ID="n57.30">57/30.

He is said to have taught medicine at that school, and afterwards from the end of the twelfth to the beginning of the thirteenth century to have lived at Paris as Major-domo and Physician to Philip Augustus (1180-1223). His two works, "De Urinis, de Pulsibus, de Virtutibus et laudibus compositorum medicamentorum" and "De Signis et symptomatibus &aelig;gritudinum" are in metre and expressed in classical Latin far superior to that of contemporary medical authors.  Arderne wrote a commentary in English upon the "Tractatus de urinis," and a copy of it exists in the Hunterian Library at Glasgow.

The meaning of this passage seems obscure at first, but Arderne says that myrobalani in their different forms were good against the different humours recognised by the ancient physicians&mdash;Sanguis, choler, melancholia and phlegma.  "Myrobalani are the fruit of several species of Terminalia and of the Phyllanthus emblica," says "Mayne's Expository Lexicon" (Sydenham Soc. edition).  They contain a large quantity of tannin and in <PB N="126">the M. chebul&aelig; some gallic acid.  They were much employed by the Arabian physicians in many diseases; some lauding them as emetics and cathartics which purged away all evil humours; and others as useful in the treatment of diarrh&oelig;a and dysentery, acting first as a laxative and then as an astringent&mdash;the view taken by Arderne, cf. 62/14.  They were formerly much employed in European medicine, but are not now used. The dose was 2 to 8 drachms.  Myrobalani citrina is the fruit of a variety of Terminalia chebul&aelig;; they were sometimes called White Galls.

<NOTE ID="n98.6">98/6. Anthrax is considered both by Salicet and by de Chauliac.  Salicet (Ed. Pifteau, p. 176) says that anthrax and carbuncle are the same, except that anthrax is the more malignant and acute.  It was called "Bonne Bube," says Guy (Ed. Nicaise, p. 100), "in the opposite sense because it is very wicked and very dangerous," just as we call the fairies "good folk" or say of a baby "how ugly he is."</NOTE><NOTE ID="n100.15"><LIST><ITEM><P>100/15. <LABEL>The gymewe&yogh;.</LABEL>  The New English Dictionary gives this word as a variant of gemew or gemow, the plural of gemel, twins; and of a door double.

The Carmelite Convent was founded by Sir Richard Gray in 1241, upon ground given by Edward I.  In 1350 Courtenay, Earl of Devon, rebuilt the Whitefriars church, and in 1420 Robert Marshall, Bishop of Hereford, added a steeple.  At the Dissolution Dr. Butts was given the Chapter house as a residence.  The church was pulled down in the reign of Edward VI, but the refectory of the convent remained as the Whitefriars theatre.  The right of sanctuary remained for many years, as is known to every reader of Scott's novels.  The Library at Lambeth Palace contains a will (Staff. 2, p. 548, Will 91) dated Feb. 1, 1446, and proved May 12, 1449.  The will is made by John Arderne, armiger, who desires to be buried by Margaret his wife, if dying in London, or by Elizabeth his wife, if dying at Leygh.  "His body," the document states, "is actually buried in the Carmelite church under the marble tomb with Margaret."  The will is dated at St. Margaret's, Westminster, and leaves his effects to John, his son, and Bridget, his daughter.</P></ITEM></LIST></NOTE>

Opium is a tear which flows from the wounded heads or leaves of the black poppy, being ripe.  Some promiscuously use it with Meconium, but they do ill; for opium is a drop or tear, Meconium the gross expressed juice from the whole plant.  However, they are both of one quality: opium is the finer gum and the stronger, Meconium is the coarser and weaker, yet the more malign.</P><P>"Opium is three-fold.  1. Black and hard, from Syria and Aden. 2. Yellower and softer, from Cambaia.  3.

I, 156, quoted in Creighton's "History of Epidemics," I, 155): "I saw such numbers of corpses as no one without seeing it could deem credible.  And at one side of the valley, in the very rock, I beheld as it were the face of a man very great and terrible, so very terrible indeed that for my exceeding great fear my spirit seemed to die in me.  Wherefore I made the sign of the Cross, and began continually to repeat verbum caro factum, but I dared not at all come nigh that face, but kept seven or eight paces from it." </NOTE></DIV1></BACK></TEXT></TEI.2>
