<HEAD>FOREWORD, BY DR. F. J. FURNIVALL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section" ID="DIV2.2" ><P>WHEN the late Thomas Wright offered to edit the following text for us, I got Mr. Wm. Rossiter, then of the Working Men's College, to copy it, and add the missing bits from Caxton's print of 1484. I also offered to have the proofs of the text read with the originals by a trustworthy man; but Mr. Wright said he would read them himself. Later, Mr. Edmund Brock found several mistakes in the text, and he compiled a list of them, which we issued in a thirteen-page appendix of "Additions and Corrections." On my asking Mr. Wright why he had not carried out his promise to me to read his proofs with the MS. and Caxton, he said that he did read the first sheet with the MS. and found it so correct that he did not think it necessary to read the rest. This was too bad of him, as the Society was quite ready to pay a good reader to do this part of the Editor's work.</P>
<P>The book having run out of print, one of the Clarendon Press readers made in my old copy of it all the corrections noted by Mr. Brock; and the new proofs to p. 48 were read with the MS. by Miss Evelyn Fox, and the rest by me, I adding a few footnotes from the French. Instead of adding a final e for all the &dtail;, &gtail;, &hbar;, &llbar;, &nmacr;, of the MS., these letters have been printed as they stand.</P><P> In the extracts from Caxton I have had the tagd &dtail;, &gtail;, &hbar;, printed as they (in his fount) are used in his type No. 4 *, which (says Blades, ii. xxxvii) made its first appearance among Caxton's types in the autumn of 1483, when he was printing the "Confessio Amantis" and the "Knight of the Tower."

<DIV1 TYPE="introduction" ID="DIV1.4" >
<pb N="[vii]" ID="pb.4" ><HEAD>INTRODUCTION, BY THE LATE THOMAS WRIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>THE feudal castle of La Tour-Landry, from which the author of the following book received his name, stood between Chollet and Vezins, in the part of the old province of Anjou which lay between Poitou and Brittany, where its ruins are still visible, consisting of a great donjon, or keep, said to date from the twelfth century. The family of our Knight appears to have been established there at least as early as that date. In the year 1200, a Landry de la Tour, lord of this place, is found engaged in a lawsuit relating to  lands; and the names of different members of the family are met with not unfrequently during the thirteenth century. M. de Montaiglon, the editor of the original text of the Knight's "Book," who has investigated this question with laborious care, considers that the father of our author was Geoffroy de la Tour, spoken of at the beginning of the fourteenth century as lord of La Tour-Landry, Bourmont, La Galoni&egrave;re Loroux-Bottereau, and Cornouaille, and who, under the banner of the Count of Anjou in 1336, distinguished himself by his courage in the war with the English.</P>
<P>    This Geoffroy de la Tour had two sons, our Geoffroy, who was the eldest, and another named Arquade, who is supposed to have been much younger than his brother. The latter, our Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, appears from his own account to have been present at the seige of Aguillon in 1346. His name again appears in a military muster in 1363. We know that he married Jeanne de Roug&eacute;, younger daughter of Bonabes de Roug&eacute;, lord of Erval, vicomte of La Guerche, and chamberlain to the king, but we are unacquainted with the date of this marriage, though in 1371 and 1372, when he composed the following book, he must have been married a sufficient length of time to have sons and daughters of an age to require instruction of this kind.</P>
<pb N="viii" ID="pb.5" >
<P>The name of Geoffroy de la Tour occurs several times between the date of the compilation of his book and the end of the century. In 1378 he sent his contribution of men to the army employed in the siege of Cherbourg, but he did not serve in person on that occasion. In the document recording this fact, he is described as a knight banneret. In 1380 Geoffroy served in the war in Brittany, and we find him again in active service in the September of the year 1383. We learn from another document, that at this last date Geoffroy's first wife, Jeann&eacute; de Roug&eacute;, was still living; but she must have died within a few years afterwards, for at a subsequent date, which M. de Montaiglon places in 1389, he contracted a second marriage with Marguerite des Roches, lady of La Mothe de Pendu, the widow of Jean de Clerembault, knight. This is the latest mention of the name of our Knight which has yet been discovered among contemporary records; the date of his death is quite unknown, but it probably occurred at some period towards the end of the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>The descendants of Geoffrey de la Tour-Landry appear to have
    been all active in the turbulent times during which they lived, and
    through one of them the name became again rather curiously
    connected with literary history. The Knight of La Tour tells us
    that he had sons (in the plural); for at the beginning of the book
    now published he tells us in the original that he had compiled two
    books, "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">l'un pour mes filz, et l'autre pour mes filles</FOREIGN> 
<note ID="note.1" >"<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Et pour ce ....ay-je fait, deux livres, l'un pour mes filz, et l'autre pour mes filles pour aprendre &agrave; rommancier</FOREIGN>."&mdash;<TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour</FOREIGN></TITLE>, edited by M. de Montaiglon, p. 4. "And therfor y haue made .ij. bokes, one for my sones,
 an other for my doughtres, forto lerne hem to rede."&mdash;<TITLE>The Book of the Knight</TITLE>, English translation, p. 4 of the present, volume.</NOTE>;" and in two other passages of the present book, addressing his daughters, he
    refers to the book he had compiled for their brothers, "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">ou livre de voz fr&egrave;res</FOREIGN>
<note ID="note.2" >"<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Comme vous le trouverez plus &agrave; plain ou livre de voz fr&egrave;res.</FOREIGN>"&mdash;<TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Le Livre du Chev. de la Tour</FOREIGN></TITLE>, chap. lxxxix. p. 175. "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Si comme vous le trouverez ou livre que j'ai fait &agrave; voz fr&egrave;res.</FOREIGN>" "As ye shal finde it more pleinly in the boke of youre bretheren."&mdash;<TITLE>The Book of the Knight</TITLE>, chap. Ixxxix. p. 115 of the present volume.</NOTE>." Caxton, in his printed translation, has given us at the 

<pb N="ix" ID="pb.6" >

conclusion a little more precise information on the subject, when he makes the good Knight refer his daughters to the other book in the words, "as hit is reherce&dtail; in the booke of my two sonnes
<note ID="note.3" >See the present volume, p. 205.</NOTE>."  The passage represented by these words of Caxton is not found in the known manuscripts of the French text; but we may be tolerably certain, from Caxton's known exactness, that it existed in the manuscript of which he made use, and we are justified in assuming that, at the time when Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry compiled this book, that is, in 1371, he had two sons. He has in no instance
mentioned the number of his daughters, but the manuscripts of the original text are ornamented with illuminations, and in these the Knight is always represented as attended by three daughters, for which number the illuminators had no doubt satisfactory authority. Of the history of these daughters we know very little. One of them, Marie de la Tour-Landry, married, on the 1st of November, 1391, Gilles Clerembault, the son of her father's second wife by her former husband. Marie de la Tour left no issue, and died before 1400, as in that year Gilles Clerembault married a second wife.</P>
<P>This intermarriage of the two families appears to have been favourite idea of Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, and was perhaps a mere question of family interest. Charles de la Tour-Landry, who was Geoffroy's eldest son, was married first to Jeanne de Soud&eacute;, but this union appears not to have lasted long, for, after her death, Charles married in January, 1389, Jeanne Clerembault, the daughter of his step-mother, and sister of his brother-in-law. Charles de la Tour-Landry was slain at the battle of Azincourt, in October, 1415.  There is some confusion in the family history at this time, through the imperfection of the genealogies; but a 
Geoffroy de la Tour, who was at the siege of Parthenay in 1419, and a Herv&eacute; de la Tour, who served in the wars near the same period (his name occurs in 1415 and 1416), are conjectured to have been sons of the author of our book. Charles de la Tour-Landry

<pb N="x" ID="pb.7" >

had five sons. The name of the eldest is uncertain, but he is said to have been with his father at Azincourt, and to have died of his wounds soon after the battle. As he died childless, his brother Pontus, the second son of Charles, remained the head of the family. The three other sons, Thibaud, Raoulet, and Louis, died without children. They had at least one sister, who formed a rather high matrimonial connection.</P>
<P>The family appears now to have been at its greatest height of prosperity and glory.  Pontus de la Tour-Landry is cited as knight, lord of La Tour-Landry, of Bourmont, and of Loroux-Bottereau, and baron of Bouloir in the Vend&ocirc;mois; he appears in a record of the year 1424 as giving to the prior and convent of St. Jean of Anvers the tithe of grain in his estate of Cornouaille, and he seems to have held other considerable territories in Brittany and elsewhere. He was not unfrequently employed in public affairs, and was present at the battle of Formigrey in 1450. It is only necessary on the present occasion to say that Pontus had a daughter and a son, and that the latter, who was named Louis, had four sons, none of whom left issue; so that with them the male line of La Tour-Landry became extinct.</P>
<P>All the older great feudal families prided themselves on tracing their descent to the chieftains of the fabulous ages of society; and usually each of them had his family romance, which told the story of the primeval heroes of his house, and which was no doubt frequently read by his clerk or chaunted by his minstrel for the edification of his family and his guests. These formed what were called the Chansons or Romans de Geste, which were so numerous in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the period when feudalism had reached its greatest development. As feudalism was gradually falling from its original character, the composition of such family romances went out of fashion, and we know of but a small number of instances at periods subsequent to those just mentioned. Thus, at a much later date, in the latter half of the fourteenth century, the family of Lusignan gratified its pride by employing a writer

<pb N="xi" ID="pb.8" >

named Jean d'Arras to compile the romance of Melusine, according to which the lords of Lusignan derived their descent from the marriage of one of their great chiefs of early times with a fairy, named Melusine, who every Saturday took the form of a serpent. Pontus de la Tour-Landry was one of the very latest who imitated this example. Ambitious, probably, of rivalling the fame of the Lusignans, he appears to have employed some "clerk" like Jean d'Arras to compile the Roman de Ponthus, intending especially to glorify his own particular name. It is a romance of little merit, but appears to have been at one time rather popular, as it was often printed. Pontus is represented as having been the son of the king of Galicia and of his amours with the fair Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany, where part of the ancestral possessions of the lords of La Tour lay. Most of the distinguished companions of Ponthus came from this side of France,  and the first of them, and the one who figures most prominently, bears the significant name of Landry de la Tour. The scene is laid in Galicia, Brittany, and England. It is curious now chiefly as forming an incident in the literary history of the Middle Ages.</P>
<P>Far differently interesting is the book which the great grandfather of the real Ponthus, our Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, compiled himself for the instruction of his daughters. Its interest
is the greater from the care its author has taken to make us
acquainted with the circumstances and feelings under which it
was composed. The good Knight had, as already stated, three
daughters, who had been left motherless, and for whose success
in the world he naturally felt anxiety. He undertook, therefore,
to write a treatise for the purpose of instructing them in all those
mental qualities which, in the fourteenth century, were looked
upon as constituting the character of a pure and perfect lady.
His care to inform his readers in all the particulars relating to the origin of his book is, indeed, quite curious. He lets us know the date when he began it, and that at which it was ended.

<pb N="xii" ID="pb.9" >

 He says that the idea of it came into his head as he was indulging
 in somewhat melancholy pensiveness in his garden at the close of
 the month of April in the year 1371
<note ID="note.4" >See p. 1 of the present volume.</NOTE>; and we learn from two other incidental statements in the original text that it was completed in the year 1372. In the forty-ninth chapter he tells an anecdote
 which, he says, happened in the same year in which he was writing
&mdash;<FOREIGN LANG="fre">en cest an, qui est l'an mil trois cens lxxij
</FOREIGN><note ID="note.5" >P. 103 of M. de Montaiglon's edition; it is omitted in the translation we here publish.</NOTE>; and in another passage he speaks of the battle of Cr&eacute;cy as having taken place twenty-six years ago&mdash;<FOREIGN LANG="fre">il y a xxvj ans</FOREIGN>; which, as that battle was fought
on the 26th of August, 1346, would give us the same date of
1372. He further tells us in his introduction that he employed in compiling it two priests and two clerks
<note ID="note.6" >See p. 3 of the present volume.</NOTE>, whose work appears to have consisted in collecting illustrative examples and anecdotes from different writers. Every one aquainted with medieval literature knows how general was this pratice of teaching morals
and religion through popular stories and short historical narratives.  
M. de Montaiglon has further pointed out the fact that the author
had commenced his book in the intention of following another
practice which was very popular in the literature of this period&mdash;that of composing books of instruction in verse.  He has shown that in the original the prologue was written in verse, and that the rhythm, and even in great part the rhymes of this verse, are preserved almost perfectly in writing it as prose, until nearly the end of this prologue, when the Knight suddenly tells his readers that it is his design to write it, not in verse, but in prose, that he might be able to write less diffusely, and more simply and easier to be understood:  "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">que je ne veulx point mettre en rime, ain&ccedil;oys le veulz mettre en prose, pour l'abr&eacute;gier et mieulx entendre</FOREIGN>," or, as our English translation expresses it, "but y wolde not sette it in ryme, but in prose, forto abregge it, and that it might be beter and more

<pb N="xiii" ID="pb.10" >

pleinly to be underston&dtail;
<note ID="note.7" >See p. 3 of the present volume.</NOTE>." A very large proportion of the stories given by Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry are taken from the Scriptures and from the lives of saints and other similar productions; but, like other moralists of his age, he adopted the stories of the fabliaux, and the tales of the popular conteur, whenever they  seemed to suit his purpose, and in his choice he has not rejected some which were better fitted by their want of delicacy to the ears of his contemporaries than to those of modern times.   There then existed very little of refinement in word or thought, and, in the best society, both  sexes often conversed in terms and on subjects which are in strange discordance with our modern sentiments.</P>
<P> No doubt under the pretext of instructing his own daughters, Geoffroy's design was to write a treatise on the domestic education of women, and his plan appears to have extended still further, and to have been intended to embrace the other sex also.  We learn positively from several passages in the present book, that he had already compiled a similar book for the use of his sons, and, from the way in which he speaks of it, the compilation of this other work must have preceded the book for the instruction of his daughters by some years. "And therefor," he says at the end of his prologue, "y have made .ij. bokes, one for my sones, an other for my doughtres
<note ID="note.8" >See p. 205 of the present volume.</NOTE>."  In another place, in warning his daughters against drunkenness, he says, "as ye shal finde it more pleinly in the boke of youre bretheren
<note ID="note.9" >See p. 115 of the present volume.</NOTE>;" and again, at the close of the book, in Caxton's translation, the knight is made to say, "as hit is reherced in the booke of my two sonnes
<note ID="note.10" >See p. 4 of the present volume.</NOTE>." At least one other allusion to this book is found in the French text; yet, strange to say, nobody has ever heard of the existence of a copy of this treatise for the instruction of the Knight's sons, nor has any trace of it ever been discovered except in the mention of it in the book of which the translation is now published.</P>
<pb N="xiv" ID="pb.11" >
<P>
 The book which Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry compiled for the instruction of his daughters, on the contrary, appears to have become extremely popular. Nearly a dozen copies of the original text are known to exist in manuscript, of which seven are in the Biblioth&egrave;que Imp&eacute;riale in Paris, and one in the Library of the British Museum. One or two of them date at least as far back as the beginning of the fifteenth century, and two are adorned with illuminations. In the year 1514, the first printed edition of the French text was published in Paris, by Guillaume Eustace, the king's printer. A second appeared no long time afterwards printed by the Veuve Jehan Trepperel, apparently copied from the edition of Guillaume Eustace. Both are very incorrect.</P>
<P>No other edition of the original text of this Book of the Knight of La Tour-Landry was printed in French until it was included in 1854 by Jannet in the series so well known as the <TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Biblioth&egrave;que Elz&eacute;virienne</FOREIGN></TITLE>. This critical edition was produced under the care of one of the well-known scholars of the medieval literature of France, M. Anatole de Montaiglon, now Secretary of the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">&Eacute;cole des Chartes</FOREIGN>. M. de Montaiglon has given us, in a very portable and convenient form, a good and correct text, formed chiefly upon the oldest of the manuscripts preserved in the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Biblioth&egrave;que Imp&eacute;riale</FOREIGN> and upon the manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 19 C vii), collated more or less with the others.  It is accompanied with notes, and with a rather elaborate introduction, to which I gladly refer my readers.</P>
<P>The popularity of this book soon extended to foreign lands, and it was translated into several languages. The two earliest printed translations appeared in Germany and England very nearly at. the same date. The German translation, made by a knight named Marquard vom Stein, was first printed in a folio volume at B&acirc;le in 1493, under the title of <TITLE>Der Ritter vom Turn, von den Exempeln der Gotsforcht und Erberkeit</TITLE> (The Knight of the Tower, of Examples of Piety and Honour). It forms a large and very handsome volume, with a great number of engravings

<pb N="xv" ID="pb.12" >

on wood.   The Book of the Knight of the Tower seems to have taken greatly in Germany, and it went through rather numerous editions between the date of this of B&acirc;le and the middle of the sixteenth century.  It has been reproduced much more recently, in fact so late as  1849, edited by Professor O. L. B. Wolff, as one of the Volumes of popular romances published by the bookseller Otto Wigand of Leipzig. The first edition in English, as we are informed in the colophon at the end, was translated by our first printer, William Caxton, and printed by him. He tells us himself, in this colophon, that the translation was finished on the first of June, 1483, and that the printing was completed on the last day of January, in the first year of the reign of King Richard III.  As Richard III ascended the throne on the 26th of June, 1483; as the January in which the book was printed must have followed the June in which the translation was completed; and as we know that in the reckoning of this time the days from the 1st of January to the 25th of March were considered as belonging nominally to the former year and not to the year following, it means, of course, that Caxton's translation was printed and ready for publication on the 31st of January, 1484; so that the publication of the German translation had preceded it.  I enter into these particulars merely because it has been asserted that the date of publication of Caxton's translation of the Knight of the Tower was January, 1483, and not January, 1484. It is a very singular circumstance that, although Caxton's translation of the Book appears to have been widely read in England in the sixteenth century, it was never reprinted.</P>
<P>There existed, however, an English translation of the Book of Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry long anterior to that of Caxton, though it was never printed. It is anonymous, and we have no
means whatever of ascertaining the name of the author, or, in fact, anything whatever of its history. It is contained in a manuscript in the Harleian collection in the British Museum (MS. Harl. No. 1764) forming a large thin volume, in double columns,

<pb N="xvi" ID="pb.13" >

in a good formal writing of the reign of King Henry VI, so that it is not only part of a manuscript made for a person of some rank and importance, but of a volume which no doubt contained other treatises. This translation is in many respects superior to that of Caxton. The latter is so strictly and often so nakedly literal, that in following the words Caxton has sometimes lost the sense of the original, and this is carried to such a degree that it would be easy to identify the particular manuscript which Caxton followed if it were in existence. The anonymous translation of our manuscript, on the contrary, displays much more freedom, and is more correct. This earlier translation, moreover, furnishes a far more elegant and interesting monument of the English language in the fifteenth century. It is for these reasons that I have chosen it for the text of the present volume. Unfortunately, it is an imperfect manuscript, for there are one or two lacun&aelig; in the body of the work, and it is truncated at the end by nearly one-fifth of the whole. Under these circumstances, the only resource was to supply from Caxton's text the parts which are wanting in the inedited manuscript.</P>
<P>In other respects, I have endeavoured to give as good an edition of the original manuscript as I could, and I have added a few illustrative notes to such points as seemed to require explanation. In forming my text, I cannot but acknowledge with thanks the assistance I have received from the excellent transcript and collation made by William Rossiter, Esq., to whom also the reader owes the side-notes and head-lines</P>

thaire suete songe made my herte to lighten, and made me to thinke of
the tyme that is passed of my youthe, how loue in gret distresse

fu&llbar; of sorug&hbar; and gladnesse, as mani lovers ben. But my

that I haue ben for her ful of gret sorug&hbar;.  For a true lover-is
hert 
<MILESTONE N="1/2" UNIT="fol/col">forgetit&hbar; neuer the
woman that enis he hathe truli loued.  And as y was in the saide
gardein, thinkynge of these thought&yogh;, y sawe come towardes me my
.iij. doughters, of the whiche I was joyfull, and had grete desire
that thei shul&dtail; turne to good and worshipe aboue a&llbar;
ertheli thinges, for thei were yonge, and had but tendir witte; and so
atte the begynnyng a man aught to lerne his doughters with good
ensaumples yevinge, as dede the quene Proues of Hongrie, that faire
and goodly chastised and taught her doughters, as it [is] contened in
her boke.  And whanne my doughters come towardes me, I be-thought me
of the tyme whan that y yede and rode with my felawes in Paytov and
other diuerse places that y had ben in. And also y bethought and
remembered me that my felawes comened with ladies and gentil-women,
the whiche praied hem of loue, For there was none of them that might
finde, lady or gentill-woman, but thei wolde praie her; and yef that
one wolde not entende to that, other wolde anone praie.  And whethir
thei had good ansuere or eue&llbar;, thei raught neuer, for thei had
in hem no shame nor drede for the cause thei were so use&dtail;.  And
therto thei had faire langage and wordes, for in eueri place thei
wolde haue had&dtail; her sportes and thei might.  And so thei dede
bothe deseiue ladies and gentilwome&nmacr;, and bere forthe diuerse
langages on hem, som true and som fals, of the whiche there come to
diuerse gret defames and sclaundres withoute cause and reson.  And
there is not this day 
<MILESTONE N="1b/1" UNIT="fol/col">no
gretter treso&nmacr; thanne a genti&llbar; woman to yeue her selff to
a traitour fals churle, blamed with vices, for there ys mani of hem
deceiued bi the foule and grete fals othes that the fals men vsen to
swere to the women; for y haue her&dtail; my felawes suere ofte
diuerse fals othes, and y asked hem whi thei forsuore hem, saieng that
thei loued euerich woman best that thei spake to.  For y saide vnto
hem, "Seris, ye shulde loue, nor be aboute, to haue but one." But
wha[t]<note ID="note.14" >hole in MS.</NOTE> y saide vnto hem, it was neuer the beter.  And therfor bi-caus
y sawe atte

<pb N="3" ID="pb.16" >



that tyme the gouernaunce of hem, the whiche y douted, that tyme yet
regnithe, And ther be suche felawes now or worse, And therfor y
purposed to make a lite&llbar; boke, in the whiche y wolde write the
good condiciones and dedes of ladies and genti&llbar;-women, that for
her goodnesse were worshipped, honoured, praised, and renomed the tyme
passed, and euer sha&llbar; be, for her weldoinge and goodnes, to that
entent that my doughtres shulde take ensaumple of faire continuaunce
and good manere.  And also y wol make write the manere contrarie of
goodnesse, the whiche is "called the boke of hurtinge of eue&llbar;
women, that hathe vsed to do eue&llbar;, and had blames," to that
entent that who so luste may kepe hem from harme ther thei might erre,
as thei that yet be blamed, dishonoured, and shamed.  &amp; for these
causes aforesaid, y thought to make this lite&llbar; boke to my yong
doughtres,wherupon thei might rede and studie, to that entent that
thei might lerne and see bothe good and 
<MILESTONE N="1b/2" UNIT="fol/col">eue&llbar; of the tyme passed, and forto kepe hem
in good clennesse, and from a&llbar; eue&llbar; in tyme comyng.  For
there be suc&hbar; men that lyethe and makithe good visage and
countenaunce to women afore hem, that scornithe and mockithe hem in
her absence.  And therfor it is harde to knowe the worlde that is now;
and ther [for] the resones that y haue saide you, y parted and yede
oute of the gardein, and fonde in my way .ij. prestes and .ij. clerkes
that y had.  And y sai&dtail; to hem that y wolde make a boke of
ensaumples, for to teche my doughtres, that thei might
vnderston&dtail; how thei shulde gouerne hem, and knowe good from
eue&llbar;.  And so y made hem extraie me ensaumples of the Bible and
other bokes that y had, as the gestis of kingges, the cronicle&yogh;
of Fraunce, Grece, of Inglon&dtail;, and of mani other straunge
londes.  And y made hem rede me eueri boke ; And ther that y fonde a
good ensaumple, y made extraie it oute. And thanne y made this boke.
But y wolde not sette it in ryme, but in prose, forto abregge it, and
that it might be beter and more pleinly to be underston&dtail;.  And y
made this boke for the gret loue that y ha&dtail; to my sai&dtail;
doughtres, the whiche y loued as fader aught to loue his chil&dtail;,
Hauing hertely ioye to finde wayes

<P>HIt

Constantine-noble, ther was an emperoure had&dtail; .ij. doughters,
and the yonggest had good condiciones, for she loued wel God, and
praied hym, atte a&llbar; tymes that she awaked, for the dede.  And as
she and her suster laie a-bedde, her suster awoke, and herde her in
her praieres, and scorned and mocked her, and saide, "hol&dtail; youre
pees, for y may not slepe for you."  And so it happed

<pb N="6" ID="pb.19" >


that youthe constreyned hem bothe to loue .ij. bretheren, that were
knightes, and were goodly men.  And so the susteres tolde her
counsaile eche to other.  And atte the laste thei sette steuen that
the knightes shulde come to lye bi hem bi night priuely atte sertaine
owre.  And that one came to the yongest suster, but hym thought he
sawe a thousand dede bodies about her in shetis ; And he was so sore

fader wost she was with childe, he made cast her in-to the Riuer, and
drenche her and her childe, And made to scorc&hbar; the knight quicke.
Thus, for that delyt, thei were bothe dede; But that other suster was
saued.  And y sha&llbar; te&llbar; you on the morw it was in a&llbar;
the hous how that 
<MILESTONE N="2b/2" UNIT="fol/col">one knight was
sike in his bedde; and the yongest suster yede to see hym, and asked
hym wherof he was sike. "As y wende to haue entere&dtail; be-twene the
curteynes of youre bedde, y sawe so gret nombre of dede men that y was
nig&hbar; wode for fere, and yet y am aferde &amp; afraied of the
sight."  And whanne she her de that, she thanked God humbly, that had
kept her from shame and distruccion ; And from that forwarde she
worshipped and praied God devoutly atte a&llbar; tymes that she
awaked, and al wey [kept] her selff clene and chaste. And not longe
after, a kinge of Grece wedded her, And was continued a good woman and
a deuoute, and had a good name; and thus was she saued, as ye haue
herde, forto worshippe and praie to God for the dede.  And her eldest
suster, that mocked her, was dede and disworshipped, as ye haue herde.

<P>THer was a knight that had two doughtres, the eldest of his furst
wiff, and that other of the secounde.  And she of the furst wiff was
wonder deuout, for she wolde neuer ete nor drinke ti&llbar; she had
saide her matenis and her seruice, And herde a&llbar; the masses that
she might here in the chirche that she was Inne. And the yongger was
so cherisshed that she dede what she wolde; And as sone as she had
herde a lite&llbar; masse, and saide .ij.  or .iij. pater
noster&yogh;, she come into the warderobe to ete browesse or sum other
mete; and ti&llbar; she had broken her fast, she saide her hede oke ;
but hit was but euel of custumance.  And also she wol&dtail; haue rere
sopers whanne her fader and moder was a-bedde.  And thus she leued
ti&llbar; she was weddid to a knight, wyse and malicious, that had
knowlache of her maners, that were eue&llbar; bothe for bodi and
soule. And thanne the <MILESTONE N="3b/1" UNIT="fol/col"> knight taught her, with goodly wordes and softe,
that she dede eue&llbar; to lede suche lyff.  But it was neuer the
beter for no teching nor faire wordes, for she wolde not be chastised.
But it be-fe&llbar; on a tyme that her husbonde had slept his furst
slepe, and groped, and wende to haue his wyff bi hym, but she was
arisen and gone; But he was wrothe, and caste on hym a mante&llbar;
furred

whiche misauenture the lady was oneye&dtail;.  And for that foule mayme
her husbonde kiste away his herte from his wyff, And loued an other,
in suche wise that euer after the housholde yede to not.  And this
behapped her for the misgouernaunce abouesaid, to ete and make suche
reue&llbar; out of tyme bothe bi the morw and atte night, for the
whiche she lost her eye, and her husbondes loue, and the housholde
stroied ; and therfor it is good to saie matenis and here masse

ringes, he wi&llbar; use it whiles thei aren on."  But it happed other
wise with her suster, for she acustomed her selff of youthe to serue
God devoutly in the 
<MILESTONE N="3b/2" UNIT="fol/col">chirche, and
saie her matenis and here her masse fastinge; and therfor God
gerdonithe her, and gaue her a riche knight and a puissaunt, and
[they] leued longe togederes worshipfully. And after it happed that
the fader come to see his doughters, and atte the Eldestys hous he was
receiued worshipfulli, with gret richesse, ioye, and gladnesse, and
atte the yongest doughtres hous it was turned up-so-doun, and a&llbar;
unthrifti, and she oneyed.  And whanne the fader come home to his
hous, he chidde his wiff, saieng that she had lost his doughter for
leting her haue to moche her wi&llbar;, and to lete her goormaunde
oute of tyme.  And bi this exsaumple it is good to serue God and here
masse, whanne folke may, fastinge, and lyue tempered and moderat lyff,
and ete and drinke atte oures in due tyme, as about prime, and sope
atte oure couenable after the tyme of the yeere; for suche lyff as ye

<P>THer was a worthi burgoyze, a good woman, wel named and charitable,

gret almesses, and uisited the sike, and norisshed faderles children,
and was atte the masses ti&llbar; mydday, and saide her matenis, with
gret and meruailous other seruise, and used the blessed lyf that any

in a&llbar; mennis sight her berieles began to smoke, and the erthe to

shroue 
<note ID="note.20" >MS. "sroue"</NOTE> her and was sethe of holy lyff, and so
she had awaye the spottys of the siluer plater.  And so was she saued
by her shrifte.  And the beginnyng of her saluacion was the fast on
the Friday and Saterday in worship of Cristes passion and the
uirginite of oure lady, for the whiche she was furst saued from the
perile of the we&llbar;, for there nys no good dede but it be
quitte. Therfor it is a blessed thinge to faste, for the more harme it
dothe the faster, the more is the merit, and of gretter valour; for
and the fast greued not, hit were not merit.  And yet forto shewe an
other exsaumple that fastinge is gret meryt, the king of Nynbe and his
citees were saued, as it is wretin in the Bible, for God had made mani
citees to sinke for the synne that thei delited hem inne.  And so God
sent worde to the kinge and the citee bi the profete Ionas, But yef
thei amende hem, the citee and the peple shulde be perysshed.  And
thanne the peple were aferde, and forto apese the wrath of God,

<P>THer was a genti&llbar; knightes doughter that wratthe&dtail; atte the
tables with a genti&llbar; man that was riotous and comberous
and had&dtail; an eue&llbar; hede; and the debate was on a point that he
plaied, that she saide it was wronge; and so the wordes and the
debate rose so, that she saide that he was a lewde fole, And
thanne lost the game in chiding.  And y saide to the genti&llbar;
woman, "anger you not in no maner wise of that that he saithe,

<pb N="21" ID="pb.34" >



for ye know wel that he is of hig&hbar; wordes and fu&llbar; of foly
ansueres, wherfor y praie you for youre worship that ye take no debate
with hym."  And y tolde her lyk as y wolde haue saide to my suster her
[? or] doughter, but she wolde not do after me, but chidde faster with
the squier, more thanne afore, and saide that he was not; with mani
other wordes; &amp; he ansuered "y am beter man that ye ar woman." And
she saide he lyed; and the wordes rose soo ti&llbar; he saide, yef she
were wise and good, she wolde not come in mennis chaumbres bi night
derkelyng withoute cande&llbar;, nor to co&llbar; and kisse men in her
beddis alone, 
<MILESTONE N="7b/2" UNIT="fol/col">as she dede.  And
she wende we&llbar; haue venged her, and saide he lied; and he saide
he did not, And that suche and suche had saine her do hit.  And so
ther was mani that herde and wist yt, that knew it not. And sum saide
it had&dtail; be beter for her to holde her pees, and haue saide no
worde, and that she had bete her selff with her owne staffe; that is
to saie, by her tonge and her speche. And, after these wordes, she
wepte and saide he had sclaundred her, and that it shul&dtail; not
abide unponisshed; and she assailed hym agayn, and cried and chidde
with hym afore a&llbar; the peple, ti&llbar; he spake yet fouler and
worse wordes, and more shamfu&llbar; by her, that neuer might
fa&llbar; from her for no shakinge that euer she coulde shake, and
thus she shamed her selff wit&hbar; her gret herte, and wordes. And
therfor here is a good ensaumple how no woman ought to chide nor to
striue with a fole that she supposit&hbar; haue a malicious hert, but
she shulde rather eschewe his companye. And whanne thei wi&llbar;
speke highly, lete hem be, and go from hem, and speke not to hem, And
saie, "frendes, y see ye wy&llbar; speke riotesly and oute of the
waye, and therfor y wi&llbar; leue you the felde, and go my way."  As
a knight dede to a ladi that y knew, that had an eue&llbar; hede and
enuyouse, &amp; saide mani eue&llbar; wordes to the knight afore
a&llbar; folk, and he saide, "ladi, hit likithe you to saie here bi me
mani merueylous wordes, and, yef y herkyn you, y do you no wrong; y
see ye be wrothe, of the whiche y am sori." &amp; not for that yet she
wolde not holde 
<MILESTONE N="8/1" UNIT="fol/col"> her pees, he
writhed a lite&llbar; wipse of strawe, and sette it afore her, and
saide, "ladi, yef that ye wi&llbar; chide more, chide with

that straw, for y leue you here in my stede."  And he yede his
waye &amp; lefte her, and it was holde we&llbar; done of the knight;
and thanne she was w[r]other thanne afore, whanne she fonde no
body to chide wit&hbar;. And so shulde it be done to striuers and to
chiders, for folke shulde not striue with foles ; and thei that
haue an eue&llbar; hede and wol&dtail; chide, folke aught to eschewe hem,

<P>THer was a woman that had a pie in a cage, that spake and wolde
te&llbar; talys that she saw do.  And so it happed that her husbonde
made kepe a gret ele in a lite&llbar; ponde in his gardin, to that

<P>THer was a genti&llbar; woman that was weddid to a squier, and she
loued hym so moche that she was ielous ouer a&llbar; women that he
spake with; for the whiche he blamed ofte her, but it was neuer the
beter.  And amonge other she was gelous of a woman that had&dtail; a
gret and an high herte; And so on a tyme she reproued that woman with
her husbonde, and she saide she saide not true, and the wiff saide she
lied.  And they ranne togedres and pulled of a&llbar; that euer was on
her hedes, and plucked eche other bi the here of the hede right
eue&llbar;.  And she that was accused, caught a staffe, and smote the
wiff on the nose suche a stroke that she brake her nose, and that al
her lyff after she had&dtail; her nose al croked, the whiche was a
foule mayme and blemesshing of her uisage; for it is the fairest
membre that man or woman hathe, and sittithe in the 
<MILESTONE N="8b/1" UNIT="fol/col">middi&llbar; of the uisage.  And so was the
wiff fouled and maymed a&llbar; her lyff, and her husbonde saide ofte
to her, that it hadde be beter that she had not be ielous, thanne
forto haue undone her uisage as she had&dtail;.  And also for that
defoulyng of her uisage her husbonde might neuer finde in his herte to
loue her hertly as he dede before, and he toke other women, and thus
she lost his loue thorugh her ielosie and foly. And therfor here [is]
a good ensaumple to a&llbar; good women, that thei aught to leue
a&llbar; such fantasyes, and suffre and endure paciently her anger,
yef thei haue ani; as dede an aunte of myn, the whiche tolde me
diuerse tymes of that she had suffered.  She was a ladi of Fraunce,
that might spende more thanne fyue hundred pounde bi yeere, and helde
a noble estate, and she had a knight to her husbon&dtail; that was
merueilously lecherous, the whiche had eueri day in his hous one or
two women besides the lady his wiff. And ofte tyme he rose from her to
go lyge with his leude women, and a&llbar; wey, whanne he come agein

wasshe his hondes, and he saide he come from the

<pb N="24" ID="pb.37" >

were atte sum tyme whanne thei were meri and allone, she wolde saie,
"syr, y know a&llbar; youre doinge by suche women and suche, but sethe
it ys youre lust, and that y may sette no remedie theron, y wi&llbar;
make you nor them neuer the worse chere; For y were a fole to slee my

<MILESTONE N="8b/2" UNIT="fol/col"> But y

wo&llbar; suffre it."  And so with her goodly wordes he repented hym,
and was conuerted in goodnesse atte the laste, and he dede nomore
eue&llbar;; And thus with fairenesse she ouercome hym.  And bi this
ensaumple it may be sene that a woman may chastise her husbonde, and
make hym do we&llbar;, wit&hbar; fairnesse rather thanne wit&hbar;
rudenesse.  For there is mani men that haue eue&llbar; hertys, and
thei be foule spoken to, wi&llbar; do the worse, not withstondinge the
husbond aught [not] to loue his wiff the wors thou she be ielous ouer
hym. For the wise man saithe that ielosye is a gret ensaumple of loue,
for he that louit&hbar; me not, rechithe neuer whedir y do we&llbar;
or eue&llbar;; but my frende is sori whanne y do eue&llbar;, and
therfor ielosie is neuer withoute gret loue.  But there is
.ij. diuerse ielosyes, whiche that one ys worse thanne that other.
For there is one 
<note ID="note.21" >MS. "none."</NOTE> withoute reson, as a man to
be ielous withoute cause, and in suche wise as to shame hym selff and
his wiff; but that other ys of a woman that is aferde lest an other
shulde haue the herte of her husbonde, that she augh[t]to haue her
selff, after the law of God and the chirche.  But the wisest aught to
be leste ielous, and restreine and take lest hede, for that is gret
wisdom who may do it; but yef the husbonde perceiuithe of the wiff sum
leude taches in her gouernaunce or behauing, that he aught to be
ielous.  
<MILESTONE N="9/1" UNIT="fol/col"> For he must take her
and speke therof priueli betwene hem two, that no man wete it, for

And with suche goodly wordes ye aught to entrete youre wiff to,
bring her oute of her leudenesse; for yef a man rebuke her, and
fare foule with her, it wi&llbar; make her do and thenke the worse, as

<P>And therfor here is a good ensaumple to amesure in this matere
bothe herte and thought.  Also, a woman aught not to striue with her
husbonde, nor yeue hym no displesaunce

<note ID="note.22" >MS. "displesaunte."</NOTE> [nor] ansuere her husbonde afore
straungers, as dede onis a woman that dede ansuere her husbonde afore
straungeres like a rampe, with gret uelonis wordes, dispraising hym
and setting hym atte not; of the whiche he was ofte ashamed, and bade
her holde her pees for shame, but 
<MILESTONE N="9/2" UNIT="fol/col">the more faire he spake, the worse [s]he dede.  And he,
that was angri of her gouernaunce, smote her with his fiste downe to
the erthe; And thanne with hys fote he stroke her in the uisage and
brake her nose, and a&llbar; her lyff after she had her nose croked,
the whiche shent and dysfigured her uisage after, that she might not
for shame shewe her uisage, it was so foule blemisshed.  And this she
had for her eue&llbar; and gret langage, that she was wont to saie to
her husbonde. And therfor the wiff aught to suffre and lete the
husbonde haue the wordes, and to be maister, for that is her
worshippe; for it is shame to here

<pb N="26" ID="pb.39" >


striff betwene hem, and in especial before folke.  But y saie not
but whanne thei be allone, but she may te&llbar; hym with goodly
wordes, and counsaile hym to amende yef he do amys.  And yef
he canne ani good thanne he wi&llbar; cunne her moche thanke, and

was angri she wolde saie no wordes ti&llbar; he was appesed.  And
whanne the hete was passed, she might rule hym as her lust. And
this was gret witte of that ladi, and so shulde a&llbar; women do.
And a&llbar; women that ben gret herted and misansueringe her

in talkinge, ridyng on the waye, one of hem saide, "it is a noble
thinge a man to haue a good wiff that obeiethe and dothe his biddinge
atte a&llbar; tymes."  "Be my trouthe" saide that other "my wiff

"lete leye a wager of a dener, and whos wiff that obeiethe worst, lete
her husbonde paie for the dener;" and thus the wager was leyde.  And
thei ordeined amonges hem how thei shulde saie her wyfes, for thei
ordeined that eueri man shulde bidde his wyff lepe into a basin that
thei shulde sette afore her, and they were suoren that none shulde
lete his wiff haue weting of her wager, saue only thei shulde saye,
"lokithe, wiff, that y comaunde be done."  How euer it be, after one
of hem hade his wiff lepe into the basin that he had sette afore her
on the grounde, and she ansuered and axed wherto, and he saide, "for
it is myn luste,and y wi&llbar; ye do it." "Be God," quo&dtail; she,
"ywi&llbar; furst wete wherto ye

<pb N="27" ID="pb.40" >



wi&llbar; haue me lepe into the basin." And for no thinge her
husbon&dtail; coude do she wolde not do it. So her husbonde up with
his fust, and gaue her .ij. or .iij. gret strokes; and thanne yede
thei to the secounde marchauntys hous, and he comaunded that what euer
he bade do it shulde be do, but it was not longe after but he bade his
wiff lepe into the basin that was afore her on the flore, and she
asked wherto, and she saide she wolde not for hym.  And thanne he toke
a staffe, and al tobete her; and thanne thei yode to the 
<MILESTONE N="9b/2" UNIT="fol/col">thridde marchauntes hous, and there thei
fonde the mete on the borde, and he rowned in one of his felawes
heres, and saide, "after dyner y wi&llbar; assaie my wiff, and bidde
her lepe into the basin."  And so thei sette hem to her dyner.  And
whan thei were sette, the good man saide to his wiff, " whateuer y
bidde, loke it be done, how euer it be."  And she that loued hym, and
dredde hym, herde what he saide, and toke hede to that worde; but she
wost not what he ment, but it happed that thei had atte her dyner rere
eggis, and there lacked salt on the borde, and the good man saide,
"wiff, sele sus table ;" and the wiff understode that her husbonde had
saide, "seyle sus table," the whiche is in Frenshe "lepe on the
borde."  And she, that was aferde to disobeie, lepte upon the horde,
and threw down mete, and drinke, and brake the verres, and spilt
a&llbar; that there was on the borde. "What," saide the good man,
"thanne canne ye none other plaie, wiff?"  "Be ye wode, sir," she

that is to saie, salt on the borde."  "Bi my trouthe," she saide, "y
understode that ye bade me lepe on the borde," and there was moche
mirthe and laughinge. And the other two marchauntes saide it was no
nede to bidde her lepe into the basin, for she obeied ynough; wher
thorug&hbar; thei consented that her husbond had wonne the wager, and thei
had lost bothe.  And after she was gretly preised

her husbonde; for the good doutithe and louithe her husbondes,

woman do the comaundement of her husbonde, be it euel or we&llbar;,
for yef he bidde her thing that she aught not to do, it is his shame.
Now haue y treted of the obeysaunce of the drede that a woman
aught to haue to her husbonde;  and how she shulde not
ansuere hym ouerthwartly atte euery worde, for it is gret shame

dede the knightes doughter, that spake to the leude squier, the

and gise, and they may we&llbar; holde it yef hem laste.  But y haue
herde saie that ladies and genti&llbar; women shulde sonner take the
gise after good women thanne after eue&llbar;, and not take the
eue&llbar; suche noueltees."  And so these wordes weren saide betwene
the baronesse and the knight tofore a&llbar; the peple, and the
baronnesse helde her pees for shame, for she wost not what to saie nor
to ansuere; and so ther was mani that saide it hadde be beter for her
to haue holde her, pees.  And therfor, doughtres, ye may see by this
ensaumple, hit is good to holde the mene astate of the good women, and

of 
<MILESTONE N="11/1" UNIT="fol/col">th[e] comune astate of the
rewme, that is to saie the state of the most partie that good women
usithe, and in especia&llbar; such astate as thei that werit&hbar; it may
meintaine.  Forto take array of straunge contrey hathe not be used,
and leue that of his owne, that causithe mani to be mocked and
scorned, as ye may see bi this knight that spake thus to his lady.
And wetithe who so takithe furst a nouelte of array on hym, thei ben
moche spoken of but now a dayes and a woman here of a newe gette, she
wi&llbar; neuer be in pees ti&llbar; she haue the same.  And the wiues
saien to her husbondes euery day, "sir, suche a wyff and suche hathe
suche goodly arraye that besemithe her we&llbar;, and y praie you y
may haue of the same;" and yef her husbonde saie, "wiff, yef suche
haue suche arraie, suche that are wiser thanne thei haue it not," she
wil saie, "no force it is, for thei canne not were it, and yef y haue
it ye shal see how we&llbar; it wi&llbar; become me, for y can were
it."  And thus with her wordes her husbonde must nedis ordeine her
that she desirithe, other he sha&llbar; neuer haue pees with her, for
thei wol finde so mani resones that thei wi&llbar; not be werned. But
the women that dothe and saithe thus, be not most wisest nor canne not
best her good, but thei haue more her herte to the plesaunce of the
worlde thanne to her husbondes profit.  And there is a maner now 
amonge seruyng women of lowe astate, the whiche is comen, for, thei
furre her colers, that hangin doune into the middil of the backe, and
thei furre her heles, the whiche is doubed with filt&hbar;, and it is

take the furre that hanggithe about her helis in the winter and sette
it about her stomakes, for that had more nede of hete thanne her
helys, and in somer it were beter awey, for flies hidethe hem
therinne; and therfor y praise not the arraye nor that nouelte in a
pore man, but y saie it not be women that may susteine and meintayne
it atte her lust; for y caste me not to speke nor to medi&llbar; me of
no thinge of her astate nor arraie that aught to displese hem, for it
longithe not to me but to worshippe and to obeye hem to my power.  Nor
y understonde

not to speke in this boke to none other women but to myn

hem how what is my luste and plesaunce  that thei do.
Doughtres, it is a gret perile to take stryff with folke that ben

<P>I wi&llbar; te&llbar; you of a lady that caught a gret blame and
sclaundre atte iusting with-oute cause.  She was a faire yonge lady,
and made there good chere, and daunsed and sange with knightes and
squieres, &amp; a&llbar; her herte was sette on the worldes plesaunce,
notwithstonding her husbonde was not best apaied with her for her
outegoinge; but she was glad a&llbar;way whanne she was praied to go
oute, And she fonde menes to her husbonde that she was a&llbar; waye
praied that she might go to.  Her husbonde werned her not, for ferde
lasse thei that praied hym wolde be wrothe, and leste men wolde deme
that he were ieleus of his wiff; and he dede gret coste to make her
fresshe and gay at the saide festis, for the worshipp of her frendes,
but she might haue perceiued mani tymes that it was ayenst her
husbondes wi&llbar; that she yede to suche festis.  And so it happed
onis atte a fest that she was atte be night, thei quenched the torches
sodenly, and made gret noyse and crye, 
<MILESTONE N="12b/1" UNIT="fol/col"> and whanne the light was light agein, the ladies
husbondes brother was there, and sawe his suster-in-lawe a lite&llbar;
asyde with a knight in a corner; and in good trouthe y trow there was
no thing done but good, but neuer the latter the brother tolde her

had done 
<note ID="note.23" >MS. "done done amys."</NOTE> amys, and loued his wiff
neuer after so we&llbar; as he dede before. And so there was neuer

her housholde yede to not for this cause.</P>
<P>Y knew another lady that gladly yede and was ledde to festis, and
she caute an eue&llbar; name bi a lorde, that she was so fu&llbar; of
sorug&hbar; that she was nig&hbar; dede, and in so moche thought that she dwyned
awey that there laft no thinge on her saue the bones.  And whanne she
shulde he dede, she sent after her Saueoure, and called a&llbar; her
frendes about

her, and saide, "Lokithe on me; am y lyk her that ye were wont to see

saide to the lordes, knightes, squiers, and ladies, and gentilwomen

comaundement of God, nor toke none hede of the worshippe that God
hathe sette her inne.  For God had made her lady of a&llbar; thinges
under heuene bering lyff on erthe, And that a&llbar; thingges shulde
obeye atte her wy&llbar;.  And yef she hadde not fa&llbar; in the

water, beest on ert&hbar;, bridde in the eyre, but they shulde haue
bene a&llbar; in thaire obeysaunce to haue demened hem atte her lust
withoute ani obstacle.  And she shulde haue brought forthe her
children with-oute payne or peri&llbar;.  And she shulde neuer haue
thrust, nor hunger, colde, hete, nor trauayle, siknesse, heuynesse in
herte, nor worldly dethe, nor no water shulde drenche her, nor fyre
brenne her, nor no thinge hurt her.  And therfor takithe hede how one
synne puttithe her oute of so hig&hbar; a worshipe, ease, and blisse
of loue into this seruage
<MILESTONE N="19/1" UNIT="fol/col">and
bondage as we be in, for she lost a&llbar; worshipe, richesse, ese,
and blysse, and the obeisaunce of a&llbar; thinges, for the sinne of
the disobeysaunce.  Now doughtres take hede wherinne the furste woman
synned, to that entent that ye may be ware therof by good doctrines
and ensaumples. And one of the furst causes of synne that Eue dede,
was for she toke aqueintaunce lightly of the serpent, and herkeninge
to her langage, that made her fa&llbar; in speche with her, the whiche
she dede of mys.  For atte the furst she shulde not haue take no
aqueintaunce nor to haue herkened to her speche, and thanne she
had&dtail; scomfit the serpent atte the furst.  Aud therfor her lewde
aqueintaunce and herkenynge dede harme.  And therfor, faire doughtres
it is not good to herkyn and take sodeyne aqueintaunce that hathe the
herte of faire speche, for sum tyme her speche is deseyuable and
venemous, by the whiche ye might cache grete blame and shame.  And so
the serpent auised her tyme, whanne Eue was from her husbonde alone,
to that entent that she might haue beter leyser to shewe and to saye
to her false deseiuable langage.  And therfor, doughtres, it is not
good to a woman to be founde alone with a man, but yef it be with her
husbonde.  But y saie not but that women shulde do worshippe to hem
that is worthi to haue it.

<pb N="56" ID="pb.69" >


And also a woman puttithe her worshipe in balance to ansuere and speke
to moche ; for one worde drauithe an other in, and thanne there may
scape sum worde that after may turne to harme, And she may be scorned
and mocked therfor.  For the 
<MILESTONE N="19/2" UNIT="fol/col">
secounde foly that Eue dede was, for she ansuered to lightely
with-oute bethenkinge her, whanne the deue&llbar; in the liknesse of a
serpent asked why she and her husbonde ete not of the fruit of the
tree of lyff as they ete of the other fruites, and she, with-oute
counsaile of her husbonde, helde with hym talkinge, whiche turned her
to myscheef that she ansuered, for the ansuere longed to her husbonde,
and not to her, to deuise what fruit they shul&dtail; ete.  And
therfor she might haue saide, " Aske myn husbonde that questyon and
not me," and thus she might haue discharged her of her ansuere. And
the[r]for, faire doughtres, takithe ensaumple yef any requere you of
foly of ani thinge that touchithe youre worshippe, ye may saye ye
wi&llbar; wete of youre husbonde, what he wi&llbar; saye that ye
ansuere hym.  And y wolde that ye knew the ensaumple of a lady that
the prince of Aquile required of foly loue, the which, whanne he hadde
a&llbar; praied, ansuered that she wolde wete her husbondes wi&llbar;,
and geue hym an ansuere. And he saw that, and lete her be, and neuer
spake more to her of that matere.  And the prince tolde to a&llbar;
the peple that she was one of the perfit good women of a&llbar; hys
londe ; and thus the lady gate her moche worshipe that she ansuered so
the prince.  And so aught eueri good woman to lete her husbonde
ansuere and not they.  The thridde foly that Eue dede was whan she
be-thought her not aright of the defence that God had made to her
husbonde and her. For God had saide hem, yef that they ete of the
fruit, that they shul&dtail; 
<MILESTONE N="19b/1" UNIT="fol/col">deye; and therfor, whanne she ansuered and tolde not
the serpent the plaine trouthe, but saide "yef we ete of this fruit
perauenture we shu&llbar; deye," and thus she putte condicion in her
ansuere, but oure Lorde putte ther inne no condicion, nor no
perauenture.  But that worde that she saide, perauenture, made the
deue&llbar; to take fote to tempte her, and enharded hym to speke to
her, as they that herken men whanne

<pb N="57" ID="pb.70" >



they praie hem of foly; for her herkeninge they yeue hem corage to
speke to hem further, as Eue herkened the fende that saide, "ye may
wel ete therof, and ye sha&llbar; not deye, but ye sha&llbar; be as
faire as God,
<note ID="note.29" >MS. "good."</NOTE> and ye sha&llbar; knowe bothe good and eue&llbar;; and
the cause is that he hathe defended you the etynge of the fruit is for
ye shulde not be as faire, clere, shyning, bright, puissaunt, and as
mighti as he."  And thus Eue wende he had saide sothe, and leued hym
for couetise and faire speche.  And so done these folisshe women, that
beleuithe these fals flateres and iangelers that counsailithe hem to
foly with her faire speche, and be-hest her the whiche they holde not,
notwithstondinge sum tyme they makithe hem with thaire faire speche
consent to foly delyte, and after they finde hem self deseyued, for
whanne they haue had her wi&llbar;, they leue hem shamed and defamed
shamfully. The fourthe foly of Eue was her foly sight, and lokyng that
she kyst on the tree and fruit of lyff, the whiche God had defended
her, the whiche fruit her thought faire and delycious; and
thorug&hbar; her light loke she desired and was tempted to ete therof.
And thus for her lewde 
<MILESTONE N="19b/2" UNIT="fol/col"> and
light lokinge she fe&llbar; into foule plesaunce and synne.  And
therfer it is gret perile to loke lyghtly; for the wise man saithe
that the most enemy that a man hathe is the sight of the yee, the
whiche haue deceyued mani with fals leude lokinge; for there is mani
that lokit&hbar; soberly, stedfastly, and mildely in her fals lokes,
that women wenen that thei be fu&llbar; of thought for distresse of
loue, and it is done but to make a fals semblaunt to deseyue hem.  And
therfor, doughters, here is an ensaumple to be ware of lokes, for many
a tyme folke be deceiued there-by.  For whanne the deue&llbar; of
he&llbar; findithe folke to-gederes with suche folisshe fals lokes, he
temptithe and enflamithe, and makithe hem to fa&llbar; in the foule
orible synne of lechery, thorug&hbar; whiche they lese bothe body and
soule. And so ye may see that this synne comithe of the lewde lokinge,
of the whiche y wolde ye knew the ensaumple of king Dauid, that for a
leude look that he kiste on Barsaba, Vriis wyff, he fe&llbar; into
auowtry and fornicacion with her; and after he fe&llbar; into man
slaughter, for he made slee her

<pb N="58" ID="pb.71" >


husbonde Vri; for the whiche God toke gret wratthe and uengeaunce on
hym and his pepi&llbar;, and a&llbar; the cause of the begynninge was
of a leude loke, as hit fe&llbar; by Eue, that thorug&hbar; her loke she
fe&llbar; into the foule and orible synne to breke Goddes
comaundeament, thorug&hbar; the whiche a&llbar; the worlde and her
of-spring was dede, and lost, and dampned.  And therfor, doughtres, be
ware of youre lokes, whereon ye sette hem stedfastly.  The fifthe foly
of Eue was whanne she touched the fruyte 
<MILESTONE N="20/1" UNIT="fol/col">that God had defended, for the whiche she had be beter
that she hadde hadde none hondes.  It is a gret peri&llbar; after ye
loke, for whanne that two vices be sette one eue&llbar; delite, gladly
they bringe her maister into temptacion.  And therfor the wise man
saithe that no thinge shulde be touched that may hurte the soule for
leude touchinge and handelyng sterit&hbar; and chafithe the flesshe and the
body, and blindithe reson that shulde gouerne a&llbar;, and makithe
thanne folke fa&llbar; into orible synne of luxurie.  And the wise
man saithe that a man shulde loke on his hondes and bethenke hym
thries or he touched ani thinge, to that entent that he shulde know
that he wolde not touche no thinge that shulde stere hym to synne ;
for the touchinge with honde and mouthe, as kessinge, sterithe the
blode and trobelithe the drede of God and the worshippe of this
worlde. And therfor moche synne and foly is fa&llbar; by touchinge and
handelinge, as it fe&llbar; by Eue, oure furst moder, that touched the
fruit of lyff.  The sixte foly that Eue dede was she ete the fruit the
whiche God had defended her; And for that dede we were deliuered
a&llbar; to the payne of dethe of he&llbar;, and straunged from gret
ioye and blisse.  For the whiche folyus dede, there is fa&llbar; so
moche sorw, payne, and woo, as ye may see by holy writte; And how God
hathe and wi&llbar; ponisshe them that etithe suche delycious metes
and drinkes, with the whiche they norisshe the flesshe and the
caryoune of the body, thorug&hbar; the whiche also is gendered ese,
reste, and hete, and steringe of the foule delite of lechery and other
synnes.  Whi takithe thei not hede 
<MILESTONE N="20/2" UNIT="fol/col">of Goddes powere pepi&llbar; that deyeth for hunger,
thruste, and colde, of the

<pb N="59" ID="pb.72" >


whiche God wi&llbar; axse hem acompte at the dredfu&llbar; day.  And
wetithe we&llbar; that synne is not a&llbar; in moche etinge, but in
the delite of sauour of the mete.  And as the wyse saiet&hbar;, the dethe
lyeth under the delites, as the fysshe that takithe his bayte upon an
hoke. And he wenithe no thinge in it but mete, and it is an hoke
whiche takithe hym, and sleithe hym, and is his dethe.  And as the
venym and poysum ys yeuen under coloure of mete and drinke, the whiche
sleithe the man ; and thorug&hbar; the sauour that is take of delite of the
delicious metes the soule is perisshed and slayne by the body, as the
delite of the api&llbar; slow Eue oure furst moder, and turned to gret
synne ; as furste to herken, and to take sodenly aqueintaunce, and to
ansuere, And after the lokinge and beholdinge, and thanne touchinge,
and cussinge and saueringe made of fals delite that Eue dede to ete
the api&llbar;.  The seuenthe foly of Eue was for be-cause that she
beleued not that God saide to her that she shulde deye yef that she
ete of the fruit of lyff, but he sayde not that she shulde deye anone
bodely dethe, but saide that she shulde deye. And so dede she furst
that was that she disobeyed to God and fe&llbar; in his yre and
indygnacion.  And after she deyed bodely dethe, that was whan she had
be longe in trauaile, And had suffered mani sorwes and payues, and was
of eue&llbar; atte ease in this worlde, as God had promised her.  And
atte the laste, after her dethe, she descended into he&llbar;, and
there she and her husbon&dtail; 
<MILESTONE N="20b/1" UNIT="fol/col">and a&llbar; thaire liff was in prison vnto the tyme
that God deied on the crosse, that was .V. thousande yere and more
be-twene.  And thanne God deliuered hem, and thei that hadde serued
hym in the olde lawe, and toke oute the good and lefte the eue&llbar;,
and took the corne and lefte the straw to be brent.  Alas ! whi thenke
not they that slepithe euer in synne to this day to amende hem, not
hope lyke a fole euer to lyue, and to abide to his last ende to amende
hym? And may not they see the dethe that neighed hem from day to day,
as dothe the theef that comith in atte the dore on the backe half, and
robithe, and sleithe, and gothe his way, and no man wote whanne he
comithe ayen ; and after, the theef, whanne he hathe

<pb N="60" ID="pb.73" >


robbed, he gothe and comithe ti&llbar; he be spied, and thanne is take
and stroyed.  And so farithe it by the synners that euer lyuen in
synne from day to day ti&llbar; the dethe takith hem, and thanne they
knowe her synnes, as the theef dothe that can not kepe hym from goyng
and comyng, and delite hem in thifthe ti&llbar; thei be taken and
putte to dethe. And so it farithe by the synner that gothe ofte to and
from in his foule plesaunce, and delited that his synne is aperceyued,
knowe, and wist so fer forthe that thei lese her worshippe, and be
shamed and defamed, bothe of God and of a&llbar; the worlde.  And
therfor a woman shulde leue on Goddes comaundementis, and do no thinge
that he hathe defended, that is to saye that no man nor woman shulde
do no dedly synne, nor to breke her mariage,
<MILESTONE N="20b/2" UNIT="fol/col">nor to do none avoutri, and eueri bodi aught to
beleue that it is Goddes biddinge.  For who dothe it not with-oute
amendeinent thei he dampned in the brenninge fyre of helle amonge the
deueles withoute mercy.  The .viij. foly that Eue dede was whanne she
gaue her husbonde the api&llbar; to ete, and praied and counselled hym
to ete therof as she dede.  And he toke and ete therof, for he wolde
not disobeie her, asid therfor thei were bothe dampned, And there lyue
to be amonge the deuelles of he&llbar; in prison and pain.  And
therfor a woman aught to be ware what she counsailithe her husbonde,
And that she bethenke her yef it be good or eue&llbar; what ende her
counsaile may turne.  And also a man aught not so moche to enclyne to
his wiff but that he shulde take hede whedir it were pere&llbar; to do
her counsaile or not.  For there be many women that rechin neuer what
fallithe of her counsayle so thaire wi&llbar; be fulfelled. For y know
a man that loued his wiff, and dede after her counsaile, for the
whiche made hym be slayne for his doing after her, the whiche was the

she 
<MILESTONE N="21/1" UNIT="fol/col">aught to mesure her thought
whedir it might turne to good or eue&llbar;; for she must haue parte
with her husbonde bothe of good and eue&llbar; that fallithe, and
therfor, for loue or hate that she might haue to ani body, she aught
be ware what she counsailithe hym, as Eue dede that wolde do
eue&llbar;, that she shulde not haue counsailed her husbonde to do
eue&llbar;.  And therfor, here is an ensaumple; yef a body wi&llbar;
not don good hym selff, as fastinge and other good dedes, thei shulde
not counsaile nor enhorte an other to do eue&llbar; and synne; for,
yef thei do, they are parteners in the synne that they counsaile; that
is to saye, thei takithe and turnithe folke from her deuocion,
fastinge, almesse, pilgrymage, shewinge good ensaumple to do
we&llbar;, and to fulfe&llbar; Goddes comaundementis and the werkes of
mercy; they that lettithe it be dampned. And therfor lete no body
counsaile none other thinge that may be ayenst his sowle, for, as it
is saide before, he sha&llbar; be partable in the synne.  The
.ix. foly, and the last, that Eue dede was the grettest, for whanne
God asked her whi she had broke his comaundement, and made her
husbonde to synne, she beganne to excuse her, and saide that the
serpent had&dtail; counsailed her and made her to do it.  And so she
wende to haue lytelyd her synne, to haue charged an other, of the
whiche it semithe God was worst apaied with her thanne before; for
be-cause God sayde that the bataile shulde euer be betwene the

she beleuid for to haue parei&llbar; to God, and that she passed his
comaundement, and that she beleued to do the deuelles byddinge more
thanne his that made her, And for she deseyued her husbonde by her
eue&llbar; counsaile, snd that she enforced her to excuse her of her
misdede and synne, there was bataile be-twene God, man, woman, and the
fende; for her excusacion displesed gretly God, as dothe by hem now a
dayes that confessithe hem to the preest, the whiche is in Goddes
stede, that in shryfte excusithe hem and polysshithe her synne.  And
they te&llbar; it not in as foule wise as they do it, And ar shamed to
saye it, but thei be not shamed to do it; And therfor thei be lyke

<pb N="62" ID="pb.75" >


Eue that wolde haue excused her.  But seint Paule saithe, who
wi&llbar; be clenly wasshe and clensid of his synne, he must te&llbar;
his synne in as foule wyse as he dothe it, or ellys he is not clensyd

there as he ys hidde, and not be wrayed of his thefte, nor that there
is none that acusithe hym, nor that tellit&hbar; his dedes, so farithe

<P>I wol telle you of a sermon that an holy bisshope made, that
was a noble and a gret clerk, in the whiche sermon was gret
foysun of ladyes and gentilwomen, that were meruelously
arraied in diuerse and queint maners, and hadde hig&hbar; hornes;
the whiche the holy man beganne to reproue, and yeue diuerse
ensaumples to make hem to be layde doun, as Noyis flode
that stroied the worl&dtail; for the pride and the disguysinge that
was amonge women.  And whanne the deue&llbar; sawe hem so
disguysing and counterfetinge hem, he made hem fa&llbar; into the
foule synne of lechery, that displesed so moche oure Lorde, that
he made it reyne fourti dayes and fourti nightes withoute cesing,
so that the water was hygher thanne ani thing on erthe or mountayne bi the highthe of ten cubites; and thanne a&llbar; the worlde was
drowned and perisshed, and there lefte but Noye and his wyff
and his iij sonnes and her wyfes ; and a&llbar; fe&llbar; thorug&hbar; that
foule synne of lecherye.  And after, whanne the bisshope had

<pb N="63" ID="pb.76" >



shewed these ensaumples with other, he saide that the women that were
so horned were lyche to be horned snailes and hertis and vnicornes.
And also he saide by men that wered to shorte gownes and shewed her
brechis, the whiche is her shame.  And so the man with his clothes,
<MILESTONE N="21b/2" UNIT="fol/col">
 and the woman with her hornes,
mockithe God.  And he saide they were like the hertys, that bare downe
her hedes in the sma&llbar; wode; For whanne thei come to the chirche,
and holy water be caste on hem, thei bowe downe the hede. "Y doute,"
saide the bishoppe, "that the deue&llbar; sitte not between her
hornes, and that he make hem bowe doun the hede for ferde of the holy
water."  And forsothe he tolde hem mani meruailes, and hidde no
thinge, nor of the settinge of her tyre pynnes and aray, unto that he
had made mani of hem right heuy and sori.  Aud they had so gret shame
that they bowed her hedes to the erthe, and hidde hem selff reproued
and mocked.  And there was mani of hem that yede home and neuer atyred
hem in suche array after.  For he saide that suche array was like the
attercoppe that makithe his nettes to take the flyes or thei be ware,
so the deue&llbar; makithe hem to be taken in synne with the lokinge
and sight of her tyre, the whiche makithe hym to desire and delite
foule plesaunce of the synne of lechery, as it is more pleinly
contened in the boke that is cleped the Lyff of Faderes. And he saithe
that they synned gretly that furst takithe these arrayes ; and he
saithe that they that ar most hardy to do it ar most foles.  And he
saide that a&llbar; good women aught to be aferde to take ani suche
array ti&llbar; it were take in a&llbar; the contrey, and that thei
may no lenger flee it for worldely shame, for thei that takithe suche
arrayes furst shal be with God most blamed and haue lest plesaunce and
worshippe in heuene.  And 
<MILESTONE N="22/1" UNIT="fol/col">thus
the bisshope preched to hem diuerse ensaumples, and tolde hem an
ensaumple of ij yonge women that wolde haue hasted hem tofore her
felawes towardes a fest and a gret semble of ladies and gentilwomen,
to that entent that they and her new array and disguysing might be
furst sayne atte the fest; and therfor they yode ouer a mareys for the
nexst waye, but thei fe&llbar; in the myre, and

<pb N="64" ID="pb.77" >


fouled al her clothes and array, and were latter atte the fest thanne
thei that hel&dtail; the hig&hbar; way, the whiche had her array
clene.  And the cause of this ij womenis hyenge to the festwarde was
knowen, and how thei wolde goo the shortest way for to haue shewed
furst her bere&llbar; and queint array; And thanne thei were mocked
and scorned of a&llbar; folke for her leudenesse; And folke saide that
it was wel done that thei fe&llbar; in the myre, for there be suche
that wenithe to auaunce hem that hinderithe hem, for, had they holde
the hig&hbar; waye and wered mene array, they had be as sone atte the
fest as the other ladyes and genti&llbar; women that come the
hig&hbar; waye.  Also the prechour tolde hem that there be diuerse
women that, and thei see a lewde woman haue a nwe guyse, they
wi&llbar; neuer leue cryeng on her husbondes vnto they haue the same,
sayeng, "Whi may not y haue suche arraye as wel as she? am not y as
we&llbar; borun as she?" but she takithe none hede of her husbonde
hathe wherwith to pay for it, or liethe in his power to maintayne it.
And thus, but she haue it, her husbonde shal neuer be in pees with
her.  And she wolde not take hede to abyde unto her neygheboures and
good wise ladies and gentilwomen haue ta
<MILESTONE N="22/2" UNIT="fol/col">ken up the guyse or array that she wol&dtail; haue.
And also the bisshope tolde hem that for suche disguysinge the worlde
was perisshed with Noieys flode.  Also he tolde how there was onis a
genti&llbar; woman that come to a fest so straungely atyred and
queintly arraied, to haue the lokes of the pepi&llbar;, that a&llbar;
that sawe her come ranne towardes her to wonder lik as on a wilde
beste, for she was atyred with hig&hbar; long pynnes lyke a iebet, and
so she was scorned of a&llbar; the company, and saide she bare a
galous on her hede.  And therfor it is a gret foly for ani woman to
bringe up ani newe noueltees of array ; for, yef there be one that it
plesithe, there is twenty that is therewith displesed, and scornithe
and mockith it.  And therfor the bisshope bade hem leue these
queintyses, for it is the synne of pride, and engenderithe and
kendelithe lechery, and of pride, for the whiche pride the aungeles
fe&llbar; into he&llbar;, And so it may happe they shu&llbar; that

<P>FAire doughters, y wolde ye knew an ensaumple of a knight that had
.iij. wifes ; the which knight was a good man and had an heremyte to
hys uncle, the whiche was an holy man of lyff.  And as to this
knightis furst wyff, she was a faire lady and a goodly woman, and her
husbonde loued her merueylously we&llbar;.  And so it befe&llbar; that
dethe, the whiche a&llbar; takithe, toke her from her hushonde,
thorug&hbar; the whiche he was al-most dede for sorug&hbar; ; and he
hadde none other comfort hut to goo to hys brother the heremite, and
praied hym that he wolde praie to God to yeue hym 
<MILESTONE N="22b/1" UNIT="fol/col"> knowlage yef his wyf were saued or not,
and that he might [wete] how it stode with her.  And the holy man
whiche had pitee of his neuew, sorufu&llbar; he yede into his
chape&llbar;, and praied God that he might see in what place she was ;
and whanne he had be longe in hys praiers, he fe&llbar; aslepe.  And
hym semed he saw seint Miche&llbar; and the deue&llbar; that had her
in a balaunce, and a&llbar; her good dedes in the same balannce, and a
deue&llbar; and a&llbar; her eue&llbar; dedcs in that other balaunce.
And the most thinge that greuid her was her good and gay clothing, and
furres of gray meniuere and letuse; and the deue&llbar; cried and
sayde Seint Michel, this woman had tenne diuerse gownes and as mani
cotes; and thou wost we&llbar; lesse myg&hbar;t haue suffised her
after the lawe of God ; and with the valu of one of her cotes or
gownez there might haue be clothed .l. poure men and kept from colde
in gownes of white or Russet. And also, with that that was wasted of
her clothes, she might haue clothed .ij. or .iij., the whiche deied
for colde."  And whanne the deue&llbar; sawe her clothes, he ranne and
toke hem, and caste hem in the balaunce with her eue&llbar; dedes.
And he toke a&llbar; her iuellys and rynges that was geuen her by
galauntys forto haue had her to do foly, and also a&llbar; the false
langage that she had saide in sclaundering other to bringe hem oute of
her good name ; and she dede neuer eue&llbar; dede but yt was brought
thedyr and caste in the balaunce with her eue&llbar; dedes; and
a&llbar; her good dedes were putte in that other balannce with her
selff; but for conclusyon her array, gownes, Iuelles, ryngges, and
<MILESTONE N="22b/2" UNIT="fol/col">
 eue&llbar; dedes passed the
good, and

<pb N="66" ID="pb.79" >


weyed downe and ouercame her good dedes.  And there the deue&llbar;
toke her, and bare her away, and putte her clothes and aray brennyng
in the flawme on her with the fire of he&llbar;, and kist her doune
into the pitte of he&llbar;; and the pore soule cried and made moche
sorug&hbar; and pite, but it boted not.  And thanne for ferde the
heremite awaked, and tolde the knight his neuew of his auision; and
bade hym take and go se&llbar; anone a&llbar; her clothes, and with
the syluer to beye clothe to clothe pore men, and to departe yt amonge
hem.  
</P>
<P>AFter the knight was wedded to another wiff, and he and the
secounde wiff leued togedre .v. yere, and after she deyed.  wherfor he
made as moc&hbar;e sorw, or more, as he dede for the furst wiff; and
thanne he yode ayen to the ermyte his uncle to wete how it stode
wit&hbar; her, as he wost how it stode with the furst wyff.  And so
the holy man the Eremyte praied to God that he might haue knowlage how
it stode with her.  And anone by reuelacion she was sheued hym there
she was in purgatori, and that she shulde be saued, but she shulde
abide in the brennyng fere an hundred yere, forto clense her of
sertaine fauutes that she had done in her mariage; for she had lete a
squier lye bi her, and brake her mariage, notwithstondinge she hadde
ofte be shriue therof; and yef she had not, she had be dampned. And
thanne the Ermyte tolde his brother the knight that hys secounde wyf
was saued, of the whiche the knight was ioyfu&llbar;.  
<MILESTONE N="23/1" UNIT="fol/col"> Here ye may take hede that for one synne
that she most be so longe in the brenning fyre of purgatorie. But it
might be as the holy ermyte saide, that the squier and she hadde done
the synnes to- gedre .x. or .xij. tymes, and, notwithstonding
confession, thei that do it, for euery dede thei sha&llbar; be
.vij. yeere in the brenning fire of purgatori; for that fire dothe but
purge and clense on sinfu&llbar; delite.  And thus ye may see what she
hadde for her synne.  And yet she hadde not do it with no wedded man,
nor preest, monke, nor frere ; and the squier had not gendered on her
no childe, the whiche synne wolde haue hadde gretter peyne than that
she dede.  And therfor, faire doughtres, here ye may see that fals
delite is atte the last dere bought with payne.  And

<pb N="67" ID="pb.80" >



also that it is synne to haue so mani diuerse clothes, and to do so
moche coste to pare the foule body to haue the lokes and plesaunce of
the worlde, the whiche, as it ys aforesaid, causithe to fa&llbar; into
pride and into lechery, the whicho is .ij. of the synnes that God
hatithe most.  And takithe hede of the knightis furst wyff, how she
was loste and dampned for her array; for there be mani women in the
worlde that wi&llbar; haue a gowne of .iiij. <HI REND="sup">xx</HI>. or
vj <HI REND="sup">xx</HI> scutis, that wolde be fu&llbar; sori to yeue
a scute to a pore man to beye hym with a poure cote to kepe hym from
colde.  And therfor they that haue suche array ar like and sha&llbar;
ansuere onis; but a good woman shulde arraie her after her husbondes
pusaunce and hers, and in suche wise as it might endure and be
<MILESTONE N="23/2" UNIT="fol/col">
 meinteyned.  And yet kepe sum
for to departe for the loue of God, the which may helpe her forto haue
clothinge in that other worlde, as dede the holy women that were
seintis, that gaue awey her array for Goddes sake.</P>
<P>AFter, the same knight toke another wiff, the whiche was the
thridde, and they leued longe togedre, and atte the laste she deyed;
and whanne she was dede, he toke suche a sorw for her that unnet&hbar; the
knight might leue. And thanne he yede to his vncle the Ermite to praie
hym to wete how it stode with hys laste thridde wiff: and the holi man
lay in his praieres and fel aslepe.  And an aunge&llbar; shewed hym the
payne and the turment that she was made to suffre and endure, the
cause why for he sawe perfitly, how a deue&llbar; helde her bi the
tresses of the here of her hede, like as a lyon holdithe his praie, in
suche wise as she might not with her hede remoue; and the same
deue&llbar; putte and thruste in her browes, temples, and forhede,
hote brenninge alles and nedeles, into the brayne; and the poure woman
cried atte eueri tyme that he threste in alle or nedi&llbar;, the
whiche was brenninge.  And the Ermyte asked the aunge&llbar; whi the
fende dede her suffre that peyne. And the aunge&llbar; saide, for
because she hadde, whanne she was on lyue, plucked her browes, front,
and forehed, to haue awey the here, to make her selff the fayrer to
the plesinge of the worlde; wherfor, in euery hole that her here hathe

<MILESTONE N="23b/1" UNIT="fol/col">And after that the deue&llbar; had made her suffre tho
gret peynes, the which dured longe, another deue&llbar; come, with
gret sharpe foule hideous tethe and clowes, and enflaumed her face
with brenning piche, oyle, terre, grece, and boyling lede, and ferde
so horribly with her, that the Ermite tremeled and was almost oute of
his witte for ferde.  And the aunge&llbar; comforted hym, and saide
that he be not aferde, for she hadde wel deserued the payne, with more
; and the Ermite asked whi.  The aunge&llbar; ansuered, for whanne she
was on lyue she plucked, popped, and peinted her uisage, forto plese
the sight of the worlde, the whiche dede is one of the synnes that
displeses most God ; and that is a synne of pride that drawithe after
hym the ynne of lechery, for the whiche Noieys flode come and stroyed
a&llbar; the worl&dtail;; for of a&llbar; thinge it displesithe most
the creatoure that wi&llbar; yeue hym-self other beauute thanne nature

suffre 
<MILESTONE N="23b/2" UNIT="fol/col">this payne.  And the
aungel bade the ermite goo see the uisage of the body that was dede,
"and ye sha&llbar; see that it ys hideous and ferdfu&llbar;."  And the
Ermite asked the aunge&llbar; yef she shulde be longe in turment.  And
he saide she shulde be thereinne a thousande yere and more, but the
terme other-wise he wolde not te&llbar;.  And the fende alweye wolde
smere her in the face with the brennynge piche, grese, oyle, lede, and

was made or bor&nmacr;.  And for the fere that the Ermite hadde, he
sterte and waked oute of his auisyon, and come to the knight, and
tolde hym a&llbar; that he had sain.  And the knight was abasshed, and
yode to see the body

that was not beryed.  And he sawe his wiffes face so blacke,
horible, and hideous, that it was wonder thinge to see ; wherthorug&hbar; he beleued the Ermytes wordes were true. And so the

a&llbar; them that taught the cristen faithe, and made them to be
robed and betin, so that it behoued [them] to fle oute of the Reaume.
She had no mercy of no man, and therfor was she cursed and hated of
God and man.  Ther was a man that was called Nabot, the whiche had a
good pece of wyne, and the kinge desired often tymes to haue it by
beying or otherwise, but that good man wolde not consent therto with
good herte.  And so saide the king to the abouesaid quene his wyff,

that he hadde geuen her that wyne ; of the whiche it displesed God.
And the king Josue sent for to make her werre, so that he toke the
king Ataz, and about .lx. children, what gret and lite&llbar;, that he
had norisshed among his men, and made cutte of thaire hedes. And that

disguysed in, and in other manere thanne the other women were.  And
she was displesed and proude that, as sone as she sawe the kinge, she
beganne to curse, and saie a&llbar; the villane that she coude.  And
the kinge beganne to beholde the queintise and the disguisyng of her

comaunded sum of his men that thei shulde goo thedir and caste her

as he comaunded, it was done, for they toke her and caste her downe.
And she deyed velonusly, and the kinge comaunded that, for her gret
mischef that she had done, that she shulde haue no berielles; and
nomore she had&dtail; but was eten and deuoured with dogges, and so

<P>THer was a goodly lady that hadde but a yonge childe vnto her sone,

but the good lady hys wiff considered the gret shame that shulde haue

to be armed, and mounted vpon a good cursere, and rode into the felde,
and hadde her uisage deffait in suche wise that she was vnknowe vnto
eueri creatoure.  And for as moc&hbar; as God sawe the bounte and

of her lord and husbonde, and for the loue that she had vnto hym, God
sent the victorie and the honoure be vnto her husbonde bi her handes,
for she conquered his enemy.  And whanne the bataile was ydo, the

was brought ferthe and dysarmed before the Emperesse, and the
Emperesse knewe her we&llbar; the wyff of the Senatour; and from that

counsailed hym for the helthe of his soule.  So he had a chamberleyn
with hym that he had norisshed from his childehode, and had serued the
emperoure truly euermore.  This chamberleyn sawe wel that his lorde
might not ascape that dethe, and that a&llbar; the lordes counsailed
hym vnto his plesaunce. The chaumberleyn come vnto his lorde, &amp;
axsed hym, "Sir!  how fele ye youre self, and in youre hert ?" And the
emperour saide vnto hym, "Y fele my selff right feble and sike."
And thanne his chamberlein beganne to saie vnto hym in right discrete
and goodly wise, "Syre!  God hathe yeue you in this worlde gret
honoures, Richesses, and alle worldly welthe and ioye; wherfor, thanke
God therfor, and haue youre mynde vpon hym for his goodnesse; and of

to flater hym; and his chamberleyn spake vnto hym sharpely and truly,
for the helthe of his soule and for his saluacion.  For who so louithe

shulde not flater hym, nor eschewe to counsaile hym truly in a&llbar;

hym the profit of his soule, as dede his trewe poure servaunt, the

see here with his eyen and to be seruaunt vnto her that was the clene
mayde and moder vnto God and man.  And in the same wise the holy

 moche as the wyne was failled;
and the benigne lorde Ihesu Crist, knowinge the entent and desire of

sawe his moder pitouse; and, therfor, bi this good ensaumple how that
a woman aught to haue pitee upon her parentys, kyn, and frendes, and
upon the pore peple, and helpe and socour hem in a&llbar; that she

the wiff of a knight, and she was faire and yonge and of noble lynage,
and her husbonde was right auncien, and turned ayen into childehode
for age; and for siknesse and febilnesse he made the issues of his

right selden she wolde not come thereatte, nor no thinge might
withholde her but that she was euermore redy atte the houre that she

wherfor that no creatoure might neuer speke of hem but in al

And whanne the tyme rennithe as from somer to wynter, as whanne

that there was no woman so hardy that durst aforce her selff, for she

desire[d] to do armes and sought worship in straunge cuntreies, and
they hadde gret Renome, as Charmylour, Cicault, or Sarmitre, wherfor
they hadde thayre speche and were herde in a&llbar; places where as

sawe ani yonge man of thaire lynages do ani thinge that were not wele

peple. Wheffor yonge men dred hem in a&llbar; places.  And as y haue
herde te&llbar;, the said Sir Piere de Luge, he was atte the feste
where as were gret foyson of lordes, ladies, knightes, and squieres

was clothed in a cote hardy upon the guyse of Almayne, &amp; in this

goodly reuerence.  And so the said Sir Piere called this yonge squier
with his voys before a&llbar; the statis, and said vnto hym and axed
hym, where was his fedy&llbar; or his Ribible, or suche an Instrument
as longithe vnto a mynstra&llbar;.  "Syr," saide the squier, "y canne
not medi&llbar; me of suche thinge, it is not my crafte nor science."
"Sir," saide the knight, "y canne not trowe that ye saye, for ye be
counterfait in youre araye, and lyke vnto a mynstra&llbar;, for y haue
knowe herebefore a&llbar; youre

whiche were a&llbar; worthi men, but y sawe neuer none of hem that

the yonge squier ansuered the knight and saide, "Sir, by as moche as
it mislykithe you, it sha&llbar; be amended," and cleped a purseuaunt,
and gaue hym the cote hardy.  And he abled hym selff in an other

bene thaire eldres, and wiser thanne they; for a&llbar; that they saye
and teche, it is for the profite of hem that be yonge; but the yonge
folkes now a dayes lust not to do there after, but they haue dyspite
whanne they be blamed of thayre folye, and whanne they be more wyser
thanne suche as be moche more cunninge, and as haue seyn the cours of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[How Christ speaks of good women.]</HEAD>
<P>IT is conteined in the gospe&llbar; of the virgines, as oure Lorde
preched and taught the peple, and he spake vpon the mater of women
that liueden in clennesse, he likened suche a woman vnto a precious
margarite, the whiche is a bright thinge, rounde, white, and clene, a
stone so clere and faire that there is no tache therein, nor spotte of
vnclenne[s] ; and this is saide be a woman that is not wedded, and she
lyuithe in uirginite, clennesse, and chastite; or ellys bi a woman
that is wedded, and she kepithe truly and honestly the sacrement of
mariage, &amp; also by them that worshipfully and perfitly kepe thaire
wedwhode, that lyuen in chastite and in sobriete.  These be the
.iij. manere of women the whiche God praisithe, and likenit&hbar; hem
vnto the precious margarite, that is a&llbar; faire, withoute ani
foule tache or ani foulenesse; for this saithe holy scripture, there
is no thing beter thanne a good woman and rather more praised before
God &amp; the aunge&llbar; thanne man.  And by cause and Raisone that
woman is of more light courage thanne man, that is, for asmoche as the
woman 
<MILESTONE N="53b/2" UNIT="fol/col">is ycome and was drawe
oute of the man, and in asmoche as she is more feble to withstonde the
temptaciones of the flesshe, whanne she withstondithe and ouercomithe
the flesshe, in so moche she is worthi to haue the more merite and
thanke before the man. And therfor God comparaged a good woman vnto a
precious margarite, and also the scripture saithe in another place,
how it were a foule thinge to take a faire suete rose and putte hem in
a stynking vesse&llbar;; right so the clennesse of a mayde or of a
good woman that she misuse it not with vnclene men, that desyren false
flesshely plesaunce; but the women kepe euermore the clennesse of
uirginite, or elles trewe mariage, so that the foule synne of lecherie
deface not the lyknesse of the precious margarite, the clennesse of
maydenhode, the sacrement of mariage, the faithe of God

<pb N="164" ID="pb.177" >


and holy chirche, and the chastenesse of weduhode.  For and these
.iij. manere of woman misuse the vertues, these vertues beforesaide,
the maide her maydenhode, the wyff her mariage, the wedwe her
weduhode, thanne be they liche vnto the Roses in a stinkinge
vesse&llbar;, for thei haue lost thaire fayrenesse, thaire suetnesse,
and thaire vertu, for the vnclennesse that they be inne; and thanne
they be right not apparent nor like vnto the precious margarite. Wel
aught a woman be displesed and hate her selff in her vngoodly lyuinge,
wher for her defaute and foly that she is putte oute of the nombre and
memorie of 
<MILESTONE N="54/1" UNIT="fol/col"> a&llbar; good women.
As wherfor they aught wel to thenke upon these thinges, and she that
is to marie and to be wedded, and she defoule her maydenhode, she
lesithe her mariage and her worship and her good name euermore, she
deseruithe shame and hate of her frendes; of women that be wedded, in
brekinge thaire mariage thei lese a&llbar; worshippe, the loue of God,
of her husbondes, and of a&llbar; her frendes, she lesithe a&llbar;
worldely prosperite, and causithe her owne shame continuelly.  For the
harme the gret defamacion that fallithe bi that cause of brekinge of
mariage yt were to longe forto reherce, but sothely it is gret
displesaunce vnto God, for the more partie a&llbar; suche as breken
thaire mariage as man or woman, there is departing of loue, falsinge
the sacrement, and synne dampnable.  And the deue&llbar; hathe suche
pouere in hem, that thei make hem forto haue so gret delite in thaire
synne and rybauudise, and so brenninge plesaunce, that they wol neuer
eschew thaire synne, so that thei pursue vnto thaire endeles
dampnacion. But true mariage is ordeined be God in the plesaunce
betwene man and woman, is withoute dedly synne; and therfor the fende
of he&llbar; hathe no pouer in that holy sacrement, but he peynithe
hym euermore to eschauufe
<note ID="note.93" >MS. "eschauuse."</NOTE> and to draw the man or woman by sum falce
delite vnto synne; and, as a smithe that is euer blowinge in the fire,
and right so seruithe the ennemy of he&llbar; that besiethe hym euer
forto kendi&llbar; and lyght the fere flame of dedly synne witheinne

For that is a&llbar; his crafte and ioye, as a chosen hunter that

suche men and women as lyuen upon thaire flesshely delite, man, mayde,

luxurie, and they haue take thaire fowle stynkinge flesshely delite,
right so they sha&llbar; be led into the brennyng flawme of the fire

flesshely delite in this worlde, right so to be rewarded with the
brennynge flawme of the fyre of he&llbar;, by right that one hete
forto due&llbar; euermore with that other hete."  And as almighti God

And the damoiselle that knew of the knightes 
<MILESTONE N="54b/1" UNIT="fol/col"> comyng, she araied her selff in the best guyse that
she coude, forto haue a sclender and a faire shapin body, and she

suster that she had, and sawe her coloure fresshe and ruddy as a rose,
for she was wel clothed, and warme ayenst the colde, as she that
thought not upon no mariage atte so shorte a tyme, the knight behelde
furst that one suster and after that other.  And whanne he had dyned,
he cleped two of his frendes and of his kynne, and saide vnto hem, "

<P>[T]Henne ansuer&dtail; to me your moder, "Syre, I merueyll me

that al women oughte to loue peramours; But sith this
debate an&dtail; stryf is come before our owne doug&hbar;ters, I wylle
answere after myn aduys an&dtail; Intencion, For, vnto our children
we must hyde nothynge.  Ye say, an&dtail; so done all other men,
that a lady or damoysell is the better worth whan she loueth
peramours, An&dtail; that she shalle be the more gay, &amp; of fayr
maner an&dtail; countenaunce, An&dtail; how she shalle do grete almesse
to make a good knyght.  These wordes are but sport an&dtail;
esbatement of lordes an&dtail; of felawes, in a langage moche comyn. 
For they that saye that alle the honour an&dtail; worshyppe whiche
they gete an&dtail; haue, is comynge to them by theyre peramours,
An&dtail; that theyr loue encourageth them to goo in vyages, An&dtail;
for to plese to them by state of armes; but these wordes coste
to them but lytyll to say, for to gete the better an&dtail; sooner
the grace and goo&dtail; wylle of theyr peramours.  For of suche

ofte; but how be hit that they saye that 'for them an&dtail; for
theyr loue they done hit,' In goo&dtail; feyth they done it only
for to enhaunce them self, an&dtail; for to drawe vnto them the

your  fader.  But I pray yow that ye hold your self clenly

<pb N="173" ID="pb.186" >



an&dtail; without blame, an&dtail; that ye be not amerous, for many
reasons whiche I shalle reherce vnto yow.  Fyrste, I saye not but that
euery goo&dtail; woman of age maye loue well an&dtail; better the one
than the other, that is to wete, folke of wors&hbar;ip an&dtail;
honour, An&dtail; them also that shalle counceylle her for her owne
helthe &amp; worship.  An&dtail; thus men oughte to loue, by this
manere, the one more than the other.  But as for to be so ferforth
enamoure&dtail; in soo moche that this loue be mayster of her,
an&dtail; maketh them to falle in somme fowle an&dtail; shamefull
delyte, somtyme with ryght, an&dtail; somtyme with wronge, for the
watche whiche men 
<MILESTONE N="sign. l., p. v." UNIT="page"> haue vpon this
shameful dede or feate, an&dtail; also suche dishonour an&dtail;
escry, whiche soone is not put oute, And by the false watches &amp;
bacbyters whiche ben neuer cessyng to talke of som cuylle rather than
of somme goo&dtail; wherby they take away &amp; dyffamen the
goo&dtail; Renomme of the goo&dtail; wymmen, an&dtail; of many a
goo&dtail; lady.  An&dtail; therfore alle wymmen whiche ben not wedded
may kepe an&dtail; hol&dtail; them self fro hit; An&dtail; that for
many Reasons.  The fyrste Reason is, by cause that a woman whiche is
enamoure&dtail; of a man maye not serue Go&dtail; of no goo&dtail;
herte ne trewe, as she dy&dtail; before.  For many one I haue
her&dtail; saye, the w&hbar;iche haue ben amerous in theyr yongthe,
that when they were in the chirche theyre thought an&dtail; melancolye
made them ofte to thynke vnto theyr delytes an&dtail; to theyr
peramours more than they dy&dtail; to the seruyse of Go&dtail;.
An&dtail; also the arte of loue is of suche kynde, that whanne one is
in the Chirche to here masse an&dtail; the dyuyne seruyse, an&dtail;
as the preest holdeth the body of oure Lor&dtail; bytwene his handes,
than cometh most to his mynde euylle an&dtail; fowle thoughtes.  This
is the arte or crafte of the goddesse that men calle Venus, the whiche
ha&dtail; the name of a planete, as I her&dtail; saye of a goo&dtail;
an&dtail; trewe man, whiche preched an&dtail; say&dtail; how ones the
deuylle entre&dtail; into the body of a dampne&dtail; woman, whiche
was Ioly an&dtail; gaye, an&dtail; moche amerous.  The deuylle that
was within her body made her to doo many fals myracles; wherfor the
paynyms helde her for a goddesse, and worshippe&dtail; her as a
 
<pb N="174" ID="pb.187" >


god.  An&dtail; this Venus was she that gaf counceylle to the Troians
that they shol&dtail; sende Parys, the sone of kyng Priamus, into
Grece, an&dtail; that she shol&dtail; make hym rauysshe an&dtail; haue
with hym the fayrest lady of al Grece, wherof she say&dtail; trouthe.
For Parys dy&dtail; rauysshe the fayr Helayne, the wyf of the kynge
Mene1aus, for the w&hbar;iche faytte or dede were slayne afterward
more than xl kynges an&dtail; .xii. C M other persones an&dtail; mo.
Wherof this Venus was of al thys grete meschyef pryncipall cause.  She
was an euylle goddesse, fulle of euylle temptacion.  She is the
goddesse of loue, whiche kyndeleth and chauffeth the amerous hertes,
and maketh them to thynke bothe day an&dtail; nyght to the Ioye
an&dtail; foule delytes of lechery; An&dtail; specially whan they be
at the masse or heryn&gtail; 
<MILESTONE N="sign. l., p. v. b" UNIT="page">the dyuyn
seruyse, the deuyl causeth this for to trouble their feythe an&dtail;
theyr deuocion whiche they haue towar&dtail; oure Lor&dtail;.  An&dtail;
knowe ye for certayne, my fayr doughters, that a woman whiche is
amerous shalle neuer sette her herte to Go&dtail;, ne she shall not
saye deuoutely her houres or matyns, ne the hert open for to here the
dyuyne seruyse of God.  Wherof I shall telle yow an Ensample.  Two
quenes were at this syde of the see, which in Lent, vpon the Holy
Thursday, in the Passion weke, took theyr fowle delytes an&dtail;
playsaunce within the Chirche duryng the seruyse dyuyne, An&dtail;
reste&dtail; not of theyr foly tylle hit was alle done.  Wherfore
Go&dtail;, whiche was displease&dtail; wyth them for theyr enorme
an&dtail; fowle synne, made theyr fowle dede an&dtail; faytte to be
openly knowen amonge the folke, In suche wyse that they were take
an&dtail; putte vnder a grete an&dtail; heuy coope of lede; An&dtail;
there they dey&dtail; of an euylle dethe.  An&dtail; the two knyghtes,
theyre putyers, dey&dtail; also, as they that were flayne, they beynge
yet on lyue.  Now maye ye see how theyr fals loue was euylle an&dtail;
dampnable, An&dtail; how the temptacion of Venus, the goddesse of loue
and lady of lechery, tempted them so moche, that s&hbar;e made them to
take theyr fowle plesaunce In suche holy tyme as vpon the Thursday
an&dtail; Holy Frydaye in the Passyon weke.  By this Ensample is wel
sene an&dtail; knowen

<pb N="175" ID="pb.188" >

how that euery woman amerous is more tempte&dtail; wythin the Chyrche
than in eny other place.  An&dtail; the same is the fyrst reason how a
yonge woman must kepe herself fro suche folysshe loue, an&dtail; not
be in no wyse amerous.  The other rayson is by cause of many gentylle
men, whiche ben so fals an&dtail; deceyuable, that they requyre euery
gentylle woman that they may fynde; An&dtail; to them they swere that
they shalle kepe to them their feythe, an&dtail; be trewe to them,
an&dtail; shalle loue them without falshe&dtail; or deceyuaunce,
an&dtail; that rather they shol&dtail; deye than to thynke ony vylonye
or dys&hbar;onoure, An&dtail; that they shalle be the better
preyse&dtail; for the loue of them, An&dtail; that, yf they haue ony
goo&dtail; an&dtail; worship, it shalle come by them.  An&dtail; thus
they shalle shewe an&dtail; saye to them so many reasons an&dtail;
abusions, that a grete meruaylle is to here hem speke.  An&dtail; yet
more they gyue oute of theyr brestes grete an&dtail; fayne&dtail;
syghes, An&dtail; make as they were thynkynge an&dtail; Melancolyous,
<MILESTONE N="sign. l., p. vi." UNIT="page">
 An&dtail; after they cast a fals
loke.  An&dtail; thenne the goo&dtail; an&dtail; debonayr wymmen that
sene them, supposen that they be espryse&dtail; of trewe an&dtail;
feythfull loue.  But al suche maner of folke whiche vsen to make suche
semblaunt, ben but deceyuours or begylers of the ladyes an&dtail;
damoysels.  For there is no lady ne damoysell that wol&dtail; here
them, but that they shol&dtail; be deceyue&dtail; of them by theyr
fals reasons, whiche they s&hbar;ol&dtail; not here.  These ben
contrary to the feythfulle an&dtail; trewe louers.  For he that loueth
with go&dtail; an&dtail; trewe loue, as he cometh before his
peramours, he is ferynge an&dtail; dredefull lest he doo ony
thyn&gtail; that may displease her; For he is not so hardy to
discouere ne say one onely wor&dtail; An&dtail; yf he loue her wel, I
wene that he shalle be thre or four yere er he dar saye his secrete
vnto her.  But thus do not the fals louers; For they praye al them
that they fyn&dtail; as aboue is sayd, And are not in drede ne in fere
to saye al that cometh vpon theyr fals tongues; An&dtail; no shame ne
vergoyne they haue of hit; An&dtail; al that whiche they maye
vnderstan&dtail; of them, they reherce an&dtail; telle it amonge theyr
felawes.  An&dtail; of them they hol&dtail; theyre talkynge, wherof
they laugh an&dtail; scorne an&dtail;

<pb N="176" ID="pb.189" >


take theyr disporte of hit.  An&dtail; thus by suche a waye they mocke an&dtail; scorne the ladyes an&dtail; damoysels, an&dtail; make newe talkynges an&dtail; lesynges of them whiche before were neuer say&dtail; ne spoken of.  For they to whom they tellen hit, put to it rather somme euyll than somme goo&dtail;.  In so moche that, fro wor&dtail; to wor&dtail;, an&dtail; by suche mockynge an&dtail; fryuolles, many ladyes an&dtail; damoysels ben ofte blame&dtail;.

wene certaynly that no lady ne damoysell wedde&dtail; ne woman of
other estate, shall not put her estate an&dtail; worship in this
balaunce, for many reasons; the whiche I shalle declare vnto
yow. Wherof the fyrst is as before I tol&dtail; yow, that none woman
amerous shalle neuer be soo deuoute in her prayers, ne to here the
seruyse of Go&dtail;, as she 
<MILESTONE N="sign. l., p. viii. b" UNIT="page"> was
before.  For oute of loue spryngen an&dtail; comen to many thoughtes,
an&dtail; Melancolye, as men sayn; An&dtail; many one ben so
enamoure&dtail; an&dtail; enflamme&dtail; of loue that, yf they
her&dtail; ryng the last peel of a masse, an&dtail; that they knewe
that theyr peramoure wol&dtail; haue come to see them, they
s&hbar;ol&dtail; lese the masse for to please to theyr peramoure.
This is no game egaly parte&dtail;.  But suche is the temptacion of
Venus, the goddesse of lecherye.  The other Reason I doo compare to
the mercer, whiche weyeth &hbar;is sylke whiche is fyn an&dtail;
lyght, but yet he maye put so moche of it into the balaunce that it
shalle ouerbere the weyght whiche is at the other syde of the
balaunce; That is to saye, that the woman may be soo moche
enamoure&dtail;, that lasse s&hbar;e s&hbar;alle loue her lor&dtail;
therfore, an&dtail; that the loue wors&hbar;ip, and cheuaunce whiche
he shol&dtail; haue, she shalle take fro hym, an&dtail; gyue it to
other.  An&dtail; for certayne, a woman may not haue two hertes, no
more than a greyhon&dtail; may renne after two bestes.  Therfore,
Impossyble is that she myght loue her peramour of trewe loue,
an&dtail; her lord also, withoute faute or deceyuaunce.  But Go&dtail;
and Reson naturell con-

Go&dtail; beganne the world by maryage of man and woman; An&dtail;,
Go&dtail; hym self, whanne he came in to this world, he spake
an&dtail; treate&dtail; at a sermon that he made of maryage, sayeng
that maryage is a sacrament Ioyne&dtail; an&dtail; annexe&dtail; of
Go&dtail; to the man an&dtail; the woman, &amp; how they be but one
body, an&dtail; that they oughte to loue eche other more than fader ne
moder, ne other creature.  An&dtail; therfore, syth that Go&dtail;
hath assemble&dtail; them, no man mortal ou&yogh;t not to separe them,
ne take fro them the loue whiche is bytwene them.  This, say&dtail;
Go&dtail; of his owne mouthe.  An&dtail; therfore at the dore where as
the preest maketh them to swere that they shalle loue an&dtail; kepe
eche other, bothe seke an&dtail; hole, An&dtail; that they shalle not
gwerpysshe or leue eche other for none other better or worse;
an&dtail; therfore I saye, syth the creatour of al the creatures
say&dtail; so, it is but one thynge an&dtail; one body, that men ought
to gwerpysshe an&dtail; leue al other worldly loue, for to take the
loue whiche oughte to be in maryage, how thenne s&hbar;ol&dtail; the
wedded woman gyue her loue ne do ony oth to some other, withoute
consent of her lor&dtail;?  I trowe that, after

<P>[A]N Ensample I shalle reherce vnto yow of a grete lady, whiche was a lady to a Baron.  This lady was longe tyme in the state of wedowhede, an&dtail; ha&dtail; but a doughter,
whiche was wedde&dtail; to a grete lor&dtail;.  She thenne became seke,

thou&yogh;t to her tresour, lyfte vp her han&dtail;, makynge signe or
token that none shol&dtail; approche ne come to her back.  An&dtail;
thus s&hbar;e dy&dtail; styll, tylle that she deyde, an&dtail;
rendry&dtail; her sowle oute of her body.  Thenne came the doughter,
whiche was a grete lady, an&dtail; demaunde&dtail; of them that were
at her deth yf she ha&dtail; ony tresour.  They ansuer&dtail;, that
they knewe of none, but thought that s&hbar;e ha&dtail; some,
an&dtail; that yf she ha&dtail; ony, it was hy&dtail; somwher aboute
her bedde.  They tol&dtail; to her the maner of her moder, an&dtail;
how she wol&dtail; not suffre that ony body shol&dtail; come by her,
and also how s&hbar;e maade a cheste to be seale&dtail;, an&dtail; the
keye of hit brought to her, whiche keye she kepte euer vnder her back.
The corps was meue&dtail; an&dtail; tourne&dtail;, an&dtail; the keye
foun&dtail;.  An&dtail; thenne her doughter wente into a Towre where
as the Chyste was, an&dtail; opene&dtail; hit; wherin she fon&dtail;,
as wel in coyne as in plate, more than thyrtty thousan&dtail;
poun&dtail;; but the gol&dtail; was foun&dtail; in cloutis an&dtail;
ballys of threde an&dtail; of wulle, an&dtail; in other thynges;
wherof alle they that knewe an&dtail; sawe the maner of it, were
merueylle&dtail;, and abasshed.  The doughter thenne made a Crosse,
an&dtail; say&dtail;, that in goo&dtail; feythe she hel&dtail; her not
so ryche by the xxv parte as s&hbar;e was, wherfore she merueylled
moche, an&dtail; was sore abasshe&dtail;.  An&dtail; yet she
say&dtail; how of late s&hbar;e an&dtail; her lord also cam to her,
an&dtail; pray&dtail; her to helpe an&dtail; lene to them some of her
goo&dtail; tyll a certayne tyme that they s&hbar;ol&dtail; rendre it
an&dtail; paye it her ageyne, An&dtail; that she sware &amp; made
grete othes to them that she ha&dtail; no money, ne no syluer, but
suche plate as they sawe abrode, that was a coup an&dtail; a
<MILESTONE N="sign. m., p. vi." UNIT="page">
 pyece only; An&dtail; therfore was
s&hbar;e moche merueylle&dtail; to fynd there so grete a tresour.
Thenne say&dtail; the folke whiche were with her, "Madame, be not ye
merueylled, for we ben therof more merueylle&dtail; than yow; For yf
she wol&dtail; sen&dtail; on a message, or els as she ha&dtail; som

doughter tooke alle this goo&dtail; with her, an&dtail; went her waye
towar&dtail; her lord, to whome she was welcome; An&dtail; of all this
tresour was neuer gyuen a halfpeny for the sowle of theyr
moder, but soone they forgate her.  For it is not yet longe
tyme gone that I was where as she was burye&dtail;, an&dtail; demaunde&dtail;
an&dtail; aske&dtail; of the Monkes of the Abbeye where she lay, an&dtail;
why she ha&dtail; no tombe on her, or some token of her.  And
they ansuer&dtail; to me that, syn she was entere&dtail; there, no masse,
ne no seruyse at all, ne none other goo&dtail; ther ha&dtail; be done for
her. By this ensample may ye knowe how the deuylle is subtyll
to tempte the folke of the synne where he seeth them most
entatche&dtail;; &amp; soo fast he holdeth them in it, that they maye
not leue it, withoute to be therof Confessy&dtail;; an&dtail; maketh
them his seruauntes, as he dyd the forsay&dtail; lady.  For he dy&dtail;
soo moche that she was subgette and seruaunt to her gold, in
suche wyse that she durst not take of hit to doo her ony goo&dtail;.
And therfore, my fayre doughters, here is a good ensample that,
yf it befelle that God of his grace sende yow ony grete goo&dtail;
that ye departe largely of hit to the poure folke, in the worship
of God and for the loue of hym, And specially to youre poure
parentes an&dtail; neyghbours; and leue it not to be departed by the

sorowful and wepynge, told it to me in grete counceylle." And whanne

His Sergeaunts wente an&dtail; toke hym anone, an&dtail; tol&dtail; hym the
