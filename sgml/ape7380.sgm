<HEAD>ERRATA.</HEAD>
<P>As many of the following corrections consist of the addition of final -<I>e</I>, it may be well to state that, where the contracted form of that letter appears distinctly in the MS., the letter is given in the Text or Errata; and wherever it is doubtful, which it frequently is, the letter has been omitted. Occasion|ally the liberty has been taken to alter a small letter to a capital at the begin|ning of a line, and in a proper name.</P>

<PB REF="00000087.tif" N="13"> non tant&aelig; magnitudinis qualis fuit postmodum de novo firmata, et in ea regnabit tunc rex predictus Laomedon nomine qui sumpto damnoso consilio quod utinam non fuisset legatum suum in comitia multorum ad Iasonem destinavit; quo ad Iasonem veniente legationem suum explicat in h&aelig;c verba. Rex Laomedon hujus regni dominus de adventu vestro valde miratur quare terram suam intravistis ab eo licentia non obtenta cujus est intentio sub tranquilla pace eam tenere; hoc instantissime mandat vobis ut incontinente debeatis terram ejus exire ita quod adveniente die sequenti sciat vos ab omnibus terr&aelig; su&aelig; finibus recessisse; quod si mandatorum suorum sentiet vos con|temptores pro certo noveritis ipsum jubere suis in offensionem vestram irruere et depopulationem rerum et vestrarum finale dispendium personarum. Postquam Iason totam seriem lega|tionis audivit totus in ira et dolore cordis exacerbatus intrin|secus antequam ad legationis dicta verba mutuata retorqueret, conversus ad suos sic locutus est eis. Laomedon rex hujus regni dominus mirabilis dedecoris injuriam nobis infert cum absque alicujus offensionis causa nos ejici a sua terra man|davit. Itaque si eum regia nobilitas animasset nos mandare debuisset honorari. Nam si casus similis illum in Gr&aelig;ciam adduxisset scivisset sibi illatum a Gr&aelig;cis non dedecus sed ho|norem. Sed ex quo magis sibi dedecus quam honor applausit, nos etiam applaudimus ut illi et ab ejus regni finibus recedamus cum posset contingere et leve sit quod ejus enorm&aelig; consilium sit carissimo pretio redempturus. Deinde continuatis verbis conversus ad nuntium dixit, Amice! legationis tu&aelig; verba diligenter audivimus et dona qu&aelig; per regem tuum nobis more nobilium sunt transmissa recepimus sicut decet, deos nostros in dei veritate testamur non ex proposito terram tui regis intrasse ut offensam ingereremus in aliquem more predonio violentiam illaturi. Sed cum ad remotiores partes conferre nos nuperrime intendamus necessitas in hunc locum divertere necessario nos coegit. Dic ergo regi tuo nos de sua terra sine mora postposita recessuros scituro pro certo quod etsi non per nos poterit forte per alios qui presentem injuriam nobis illatam audierint non lucra sed pressuras et dampna infallibiliter obtinere. Hercules vero verbis Iasonis non contentus regis nuncio refudit h&aelig;c verba. Amice quisquis es secure referas regi tuo quod ad plus die crastina de terr&aelig; su&aelig; statione penitus discedemus, sed sequentis tertii anni dies non erit exitura dic illi quam nos videbit si vivet in terram suam velit nolit anchoras injecisse et de danda nobis tunc recedendi licentia non erit sibi plena libertas cum talis litis ad presens inchoaverit questionem quod priusquam de eo possit superare victoriam ignominiosi dede|coris pondere depremetur. Cujus regis nuncius respondendo sic dixit. Turpe satis est et nobili et precipue strenuo minarum sagittas immittere nec mihi qui sum missus, est commissum a rege ut erga vos litigiosis verbis insistam. Dixi vobis qu&aelig; mihi commissa fuerunt, si sapienter agere placet vobis do con|silium bonum ut ab hac terra recedere non sit grave priusquam possitis incurrere graviora, cum leve non sit personas perdere qu&aelig; se possunt consilio salubri tueri. Et post h&aelig;c a Gr&aelig;cis petita licentia suum remeavit ad regem.

<P>Iason vero et Hercules nulla mora protracta Philotete vocato jubet anchoram a mari subtrahi et omnia colligere qu&aelig; in terram adduxerant causa quietis. Sciebant enim si voluissent in Phrigios insultare non esse eis in congressu pares vel equales in viribus nec in potentia fortiores. Ergo Argon ascendunt et elevatis velis diis ducibus Frigia deserunt littora et sulcantes maria ventis afflantibus prosperis non post multos dies in Colcos insulam salvi perveniunt et desideratum feliciter portum intrant.

<P>[Amongst these things, Calcas and Crisis the Priest, counselled the Greeks that they should make a great Horse of Brasse, and that must be so great as might hold within it a thousand knights armed: and they said unto him that it was the pleasure of the godes. This horse was made by a passing wise Master, as Apius was, whose name was Sinon, and he made it so sub|tilly, that no man could perceive any entry or issue, but within it was easie for them that were inclosed within for to issue out when they would.</P><P>When the great horse was fully made, and the thousand knights therein, by the counsell of Crisis, they prayed the King Pryamus, that he would suffer this horse to enter into the city, and that it might be set in the Temple of Pallas, forasmuch as they said, that they had made it in the honour of Pallas, for a Vowe that they made for restitution of the Palladium, which they had caused to be taken out of the same Temple.</P><P>Among these things, the Princes that were yet within Troy, when they saw that the King had so shamefully treated with the Greekes, they went away out of Troy, and tooke their men with them, and the King Phylomenus led no more but two hundred and fifty men, and threescore maydens of Amazones, that were left of a thousand that came thither with the Queen Penthasilia, and carryed the body of her with them, and trauelled so long till they came to their owne Country.</P>
