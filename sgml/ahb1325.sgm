<P>THRE trowingis or opiniouns ben causis and groundis of manie and of weel ny&yogh; alle the errouris whiche manie of the lay partie holden, and bi which hold|ing thei vniustly and ouermyche wijten and blamen the clergie and alle her othere nei&yogh;bouris of the lay side, which not holden tho same errouris accordingly with hem, and therfore it is miche nede forto first &yogh;eue bisynes to vnroote and ouerturne tho thre trow|ingis, holdingis, or opiniouns, bifore the improuyng of othere; sithen if tho thre be sufficiently improued, that is to seie, if it be sufficientli proued that tho thre ben nou&yogh;t and vntrewe and badde, alle the othere vntrewe opiniouns and holdingis bildid vpon hem or upon eny of hem muste needis therbi take her fal, and lacke it wherbi thei mi&yogh;ten in eny colour or semyng be mentened, holde, and supportid.</P>
<P>The firste of these thre trowingis, holdingis, or opiniouns is this: That no gouernaunce is to be holde of Cristen men the seruice or the lawe of God, saue it which is groundid in Holi Scripture of the Newe Testament, as summe of the bifore seid men holden; or namelich, saue it which is groundid in the Newe Testament or in the Oold, and is not bi the Newe Testament reuokid, as summe othere of hem holden. In this trowing and holding thei ben so kete and so smert and so wantoun, that whanne euer eny 
<PB REF="00000116.tif" N="6"> clerk affermeth to hem eny gouernaunce being con|trarie to her witt or plesaunce, thou&yogh; it ligge ful open and ful sureli in doom of resoun, and ther fore sureli in moral lawe of kinde, which is lawe of God, forto be doon; &yogh;it thei anoon asken "Where groundist thou it in the Newe Testament?" or "Where groundist thou it in Holi Scripture in such place which is not bi the Newe Testament re|uokid?" And if thei heere not where so in Holi Scripture it is witnessid, thei it dispisen and not re|ceyuen as a gouernaunce of Goddis seruice and of Goddis moral lawe. This opinioun thei weenen to be groundid, Mat. xxij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., where Crist seide to the Sa|duceis thus: <I>&YOGH;e erren, not knowing Scripturis, nei|ther the vertu or strengthe of God.

Han not &yogh;e rad of the resurrectioun of dede men, that it is seid to us of God, I am God of Abraham, God of Ysaac, God of Iacob, et c&aelig;tera.</I> Also thei weenen this opinioun be groundid, Iohun v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., where Crist seide to the Iewis thus: <I>Serche &yogh;e Scripturis, for &yogh;e trowen &yogh;ou forto haue euerlasting lijf in hem, and thei ben whiche beren witnes of me.</I></P>
<P>The secunde trowing or opinyoun is this: That what euer Cristen man or womman be meke in spirit and willi forto vndirstonde treuli and dewli Holi Scripture, schal without fail and defaut fynde the trewe vndir|stonding of Holi Scripture in what euer place he or sche schal rede and studie, thou&yogh; it be in the Apo|calips or ou&yogh;where ellis: and the more meke he or sche be, the sooner he or sche schal come into the verry trewe and dew vndirstonding of it, which in Holi Scripture he or sche redith and studieth. This ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun thei wenen to be groundid in Holi Scripture, Ysaie lxvj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. in the bigynnyng, where God seith thus: <I>To whom schal y biholde but to a litle pore man</I>,

Also Ysaie lvij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. where it is seid, <I>that God dwelling in euerlastingte dwellith with a meke and a contrite spirit, that he quykee the spirit of meke men and that he quykee the herte of contrite men</I>. And in othere dyuerise placis of Scrip|ture mensioun is mad that God &yogh;eueth goode thingis to meke men more thanne if thei were not so meke.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. trowing or opinioun is this: Whanne euere a persoon hath founde the vndirstonding of Holi Scrip|ture into which he schal come bi the wey now bifore seid of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun, he or sche ou&yogh;te bowe awey her heering, her reeding, and her vndirstonding fro al resonyng and fro al arguyng or prouyng which eny clerk can or wole or mai make bi eny maner euydence of resoun or of Scripture, and namelich of resoun into the contrarie, thou&yogh; the mater be such that it passith not the boondis neither the capacite of resoun forto entermete therwith and forto iuge and &yogh;eue kunnyng ther upon; which trowing and opi|nioun to holde and fulfille thei wenen hem be bede bi Poul, Colocens. ij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., where he seith thus: <I>Y seie to &yogh;ou these thingis, that no man bigile &yogh;ou in hei&yogh;te of spechis</I>. And soone after there, Poul seith thus: <I>Se &yogh;e that no man bigile &yogh;ou bi philsophi and veyn falsnes aftir the tradiciouns of men and after the elementis of the world, and not aftir Crist</I>.

But for as miche as this vnrooting of the first opinioun and the proofis of tho xiij. conclusiouns mowen not be doon and made withoute strengthe of argumentis, therfore that y be the better and the cleerer vndirstonde of the lay peple in summe wordis to be aftir spoken in this present book, y sette nowe bifore to hem this doc|trine taken schortli out of the faculte of logik. An argument if he be ful and foormal, which is clepid a sillogisme, is mad of twey proposiciouns dryuyng out of hem and bi strengthe of hem the thridde proposi|cioun. Of the whiche thre proposiciouns the ij. first ben clepid premissis, and the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. folewing out of hem is clepid the conclusioun of hem. And the firste of tho ij. premissis is clepid the first premisse, and the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. of hem is clepid the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse. And ech such argu|ment is of this kinde, that if the bothe premissis ben trewe, the conclusioun concludid out and bi hem is also trewe; and but if euereither of tho premissis be trewe, the conclusioun is not trewe. Ensaumple her of is this. "Ech man is at Rome, the Pope is a man, eke the Pope is at Rome." Lo here ben sett forth ij. proposicions, which ben these, "Ech man is at Rome;" and "The Pope is a man;" and these ben the ij. pre|myssis in this argument, and thei dryuen out the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. proposicioun, which is this, "The Pope is at Rome," and it is the conclusioun of the ij. premissis. Wher|fore certis if eny man can be sikir for eny tyme that these ij. premyssis be trewe, he mai be sikir that the conclusioun is trewe; thou&yogh; alle the aungelis in heuen wolden seie and holde that thilk conclusioun were not trewe. And this is a general reule, in euery good and formal and ful argument, that if his premissis be knowe for trewe, the conclusioun ou&yogh;te be avowid for trewe, what euer creature wole seie the contrarie.

<P>What propirtees and condiciouns ben requirid to an argument, that he be ful and formal and good, is tau&yogh;t in logik bi ful faire and sure reulis, and may not be tau&yogh;t of me here in this present book. But wolde God it were leerned of al the comon peple in her modiris langage, for thanne thei schulden therbi be putt fro myche ruydnes and boistosenes which thei han now in resonyng; and thanne thei schulden soone knowe and perceue whanne a skile<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>askile</I>, MS.; but the words are divided by a later hand. See p. I, note.</NOTE> and an argument bindith and whanne he not byndith, that is to seie, whanne he concludith and proueth his conclusioun and whanne he not so dooth; and thanne thei schulden kepe hem silf the better fro falling into errouris, and thei my&yogh;ten the sooner come out of errouris bi heering of argumentis maad to hem, if thei into eny errouris weren falle; and thanne thei schulden not be so blunt and so ruyde and vnformal and boistose in resonyng, and that bothe in her arguying and in her answering, as thei now ben; and thanne schulden thei not be so obstinat a&yogh;ens clerkis and a&yogh;ens her prelatis, as summe of hem now ben, for defaut of perceuyng whanne an argument procedith into his conclusioun needis and whanne he not so dooth but semeth oonli so do. And miche good wolde come forth if a schort compendiose logik were deuysid for al the comoun peple in her modiris langage; and certis to men of court, leernyng the Kingis lawe of Ynglond in these daies, thilk now seid schort compendiose logik were ful preciose. Into whos making, if God wole graunte leue and leyser, y purpose sumtyme aftir myn othere bisynessis forto assaie.</P>
<P>But as for now thus miche in this wise ther of here talkid, that y be the better vndirstonde in al what y schal argue thoru&yogh; this present book, y wole come doun into the xiij. conclusiouns, of whiche the 
<PB REF="00000120.tif" N="10"> firste is this: It longith not to Holi Scripture, neither it is his office into which God hath him ordeyned, neither it is his part forto grounde eny gouernaunce or deede or seruice of God, or eny lawe of God, or eny trouthe which mannis resoun bi nature may fynde, leerne, and knowe.</P>
<P>That this conclusioun is trewe, y proue thus: What|euer thing is ordeyned (and namelich bi God) for to be ground and fundament of eny vertu or of eny gouer|naunce or deede or treuth, thilk same thing muste so teche and declare and seie out and &yogh;eue forth al the kunnyng vpon the same vertu or gouernance or trouthe, wher with and wherbi thilk same vertu, gouernaunce, or trouthe is sufficientli knowen, that withoute thilk same thing the same kunnyng of thilk same vertu, gouer|naunce, or trouthe may not be sufficientli knowen, so that thilk same vertu, gouernance, or trouthe, in al the kunnyng withoute which he may not at fulle be leerned and knowen, muste nedis growe forth and come forth out and fro oonli thilk thing which is seid and holden to be ther of the ground and the fundament, as anoon aftir schal be proued: but so it is, that of no vertu, gouernaunce, or treuthe of Goddis moral lawe and seruice, into whos fynding, leerning, and knowing mannis witt may by his natural strengthe and natural helpis come, Holi Scripture al oon &yogh;eueth the sufficient kunnyng; neither fro and out of Holi Scripture al oon, whether he be take for the Newe Testament al oon, or for the Newe Testament and the Oold to gidere, as anoon after schal be proued, growith forth and cometh forth al the knowing which is nedeful to be had upon it: wherfore nedis folewith, that of no vertu or go|uernaunce or trouthe into which the doom of mannis resoun may sufficientli ascende and come to, for to it fynde, leerne, and knowe withoute reuelacioun fro God mad ther vpon, is groundid in Holi Scripture.</P>
<P>The firste premisse of this argument muste needis be grauntid. Forwhi, if the sufficient leernyng and 
<PB REF="00000121.tif" N="11"> kunnyng of eny gouernaunce or eny trouthe schulde as miche or more come fro an other thing, as or than fro this thing which is seid to be his ground, thanne thilk other thing schulde be lijk miche or more and rather the ground of thilk gouernaunce than this thing schulde so be; and also thilk gouernaunce or trouthe schulde haue ij. diuerse groundis and schulde be bildid vpon ij. fundamentis, of which the oon is dyuers atwyn fro the other, which forto seie and holde is not takeable of mannis witt. Wherfore the first premisse of the argument is trewe. Ensaumple her of is this: But if myn hous stode so in this place of erthe that he not stode so in an othir place of erthe ellis, this place of the erthe were not the ground of myn hous; and if eny other place of the erthe bare myn hous, certis myn hous were not groundid in this place of the erthe: and in lijk maner, if this treuthe or go|uernaunce, that ech man schulde kepe mekenes, were knowe bi sum other thing than bi Holi Scripture, and as weel and as sufficiently as bi Holi Scripture, thilk gouernaunce or trouth were not groundid in Holi Scripture. Forwhi he stood not oonli ther on; and therfore the first premisse is trewe. Also thus: Ther mai no thing be fundament and ground of a wal, or of a tree, or of an hous, saue it upon which the al hool substaunce of the wal, or of the tree, or of the hous stondith, and out of which oonly the wal, tree, or hous cometh. Wherfore bi lijk skile, no thing is ground and fundament of eny treuthe or conclusioun, gouernaunce or deede, saue it upon which aloon al the gouernaunce, trouthe, or vertu stondith, and out of which aloon al the same treuthe or gouernance cometh.</P>
<P>That also the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse is trewe, y proue thus: What euer deede or thing doom of resoun dooth as fulli and as perfitli as Holi Scripture it dooth, Holi Scripture it not dooth oonli or al oon; but so it is, that what euer leernyng and kunnyng Holi Scripture &yogh;eueth upon eny of the now seid gouernauncis, trouthes, and vertues, (that is to seie, upon eny gouernaunce, trouthe, 
<PB REF="00000122.tif" N="12"> and vertu of Goddis lawe to man, in to whos fynding, leernyng, and knowing mannis resoun may bi him silf aloon, or with natural helpis, rise and come,) mannis resoun may and can &yogh;eue the same leerning and know|ing, as experience ther upon to be take anoon wole schewe; for thou canst not fynde oon such gouer|naunce tau&yogh;t in Holi Scripture to be doon, but that resoun techith it lijk weel and lijk fulli to be doon; and if thou wolt not trowe this, assigne thou summe suche and assaie. Wherfore folewith that of noon suche now seid gouernauncis the leernyng and knowing is had and tau&yogh;t bi Holi Scripture oonli or aloone; and therfore the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of the firste principal argument muste needis be trewe.</P>
<P>And thanne ferther, thus: Sithen the bothe premissis of the first principal argument ben trewe, and the argument is formal, nedis muste the conclusioun con|cludid bi hem in the same arguyng be trewe, which is the bifore set first principal conclusioun.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>iij. CHAPITER.</HEAD>
<P>THE ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument into the first bifore sett and spoken conclusioun or trouthe is this: Thilk thing is the ground of a gouernaunce, or vertu, or trouthe, out of which al the sufficient leernyng and knowing of the same gouernaunce, trouthe, and vertu cometh, procedith, and growith, and may be had, thou&yogh; al other thing pretendid to be ground ther of be awey or were not in being; but so it is, that al the leernyng and knowing, which Holi Scripture &yogh;eueth vpon eny bifore seid gouernaunce, deede, or trouthe of Goddis moral lawe, mai be had bi doom of natural resoun; &yogh;he, thou&yogh; Holi Writt had not spoke ther of, or thou&yogh; he schulde neuere fro hens forthward speke ther of, as anoon aftir schal be proued; and ouer it al the forther kunnyng which Holi Writt &yogh;eueth not upon eny seid gouernaunce or deede or treuthe of Goddis lawe and 
<PB REF="00000123.tif" N="13"> seruice, and is necessarie to be had vpon the same gouernaunce, trouthe, or vertu, mai be had bi labour in doom of natural resoun, as anoon aftir schal be proued. Wherfore doom of natural resoun, (which is clepid "moral lawe of kinde" in the book <I>Of iust apprising Holi Scripture</I>,) and not Holi Scripture, is the ground of alle the seid gouernauncis, deedis, vertues, and trouthis.</P>
<P>The firste premisse of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument is proued bifore bi proof of the first premisse in the first principal argument; and the secunde premisse in this principal argument mai be proued thus: Ech of these gouernauncis, trouthis, and vertues, now to be rehercid, mowe be knowen bi doom of resoun as sufficientli as Holi Scripture techith hem to be don, thou&yogh; Holi Scripture had left al his teching which he makith vpon eny of hem; that is to seie, that God is moost to be loued of man; and that a man schulde loue him silf and his nei&yogh;bore as him silf, thou&yogh; not so miche as him silf; that a man schulde be trewe to God in paiyng hise iust promissis, if he hath eny suche maad to God; that he be meke to God in not amys tempting God a&yogh;ens reson; that he reuerence God, and that he take bisynes for to leerne what plesith God, that he it do to God or for God; that a man ou&yogh;te be temperat in eting and drinking, and not be glotenose; and that he ou&yogh;te be contynent or holding mesure in deedis of gendring; and that he ou&yogh;te be meke to othere men and not proud; and that he ou&yogh;te be trewe and iust to othere men; and that he ou&yogh;te be mylde in speche and answere; and that he ou&yogh;te be pacient and sobre in tribulaciouns; and that he ou&yogh;te be dou&yogh;ty and strong into gode werkis; and so of ful manye mo gouernauncis and vertues of Goddis lawe, in to which mannis witt mai suffice to come forto hem fynde, leerne, and kunne. Certis of alle these and of alle to hem lijk mannis witt can teche and schewe that ech of hem ou&yogh;te be doon of man, as ferforth 
<PB REF="00000124.tif" N="14"> as Holi Scripture techith of eny of hem that he ou&yogh;te be don of man, as experience soone can ther of make proof. And also hethen philsophiris bi her studie in natural witt founden and grauntiden alle hem to be doon; and that these philsophiris so founden and grauntiden bi her naturall witt, it is to be holde. Forwhi thei hem silf knewe of noon reuelacioun mad to hem bi God ther upon; and if eny such reuelacioun hadde be maad to hem, thei schulden bifore othere men haue knowe it so to be mad to hem. Neither othere men euere knewen that to tho philsophiris was maad such reuelacioun. Forwhi, if eny men wolen so holde, thei kunnen not schewe therto eny proof forto saue her seiyng and holding fro feynyng; no more than if it had likid to hem forto haue holde that an aungel spake to tho philsophiris fro heuene, as an aungel spake to Abraham and to Moises; and sithen to neuerneither thei han sufficient euy|dence, it folewith that forto eny of hem bothe holde is not but feyned waar; forwhi it is waar which lackith his ground, proof, and fundament. Ferther|more, with this now seid and ouer this now seid of the bifore spoken gouernauncis, trouthis, and vertues knowable and fyndeable sufficientli bi doom of reson, this is trewe, that of ech and vpon ech of hem, and of ech othir, and upon ech othir lijk to hem, mannis resoun can &yogh;eue miche more leernyng and kunnyng than is therof &yogh;ouen in Holi Scripture, as experience ther upon openli schewith; &yogh;he, ther is noon such now seid gouernaunce or vertu or trouthe of Goddis moral lawe tau&yogh;t bi Scripture to be had and vsid: but that six sithis<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>sixsithis</I>, MS.; but the words are divided by a later hand.</NOTE> more leernyng and knowing muste be had upon him, eer he schal be sufficientli leerned and knowun, than is al the leernyng and know ing which is writun upon him in Holi Scripture, as it mai weel be seen to ech reeder in the book 
<PB REF="00000125.tif" N="15"> clepid <I>Cristen religioun</I> and in the bookis perteynyng therto. Wherfore the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument is trewe thoru&yogh; hise bothe parties: &yogh;he, upon sum trouthe or gouernaunce of Goddis lawe lenger writing muste be had, eer it be sufficientli knowe, than is al the writing of Mathewis Gospel; and &yogh;it of thilk vertu or gouernaunce scantli is writen in al Holi Writt ten lynes, as it is open to ech reeder and vnderstonder in the seid bokis. Wherfore folewith that the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument for his ij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie is trewe.</P>
<P>I preie thee, Sir, seie to me where in Holi Scrip|ture is &yogh;ouen the hundrid parti of the teching upon matrimonie which y teche in a book mad upon <I>Matrimonie</I>, and in the firste partie of <I>Cristen religioun:</I> and &yogh;it rede who so wole thilk book <I>Of matrimonie</I>, and he schal fynde al the hool teching of thilk book litil ynou&yogh; or ouer litle forto teche al what is necessarie to be leerned and kunnen vpon matrimonie.

And &yogh;it alle thilk vj. places speken not saue tweyne pointis of matrimonie, which ben vndepartabilnes and fleischli vce of bodies into childe bigeting. What therfore a grounde ou&yogh;te eny man seie that Holi Scripture is to matrimonie, sithen al Holi Scripture techith not but these ij. pointis of matrimonie? For thou&yogh; Poul bidde ofte that a man schulde loue his wijf, and that the wijf schulde obeie to hir husbonde, &yogh;it what is this to kunnyng of matrimonye in it silf, and into the propirtees of it, and into the circumstauncis of it, withoute which matrimonie is not vertuose? And so forth of manie purtenauncis and longingis to matrimonye.
<PB REF="00000126.tif" N="16"></P>
<P>Seie to me also where in Holi Scripture is &yogh;ouen the hundrid parti of the teching which is &yogh;ouen upon vsure in the thridde parti of the book yclepid <I>The filling of the iiij. tablis:</I> and &yogh;it al thilk hool teching &yogh;ouen upon vsure in the now named book is litil ynou&yogh; or ouer litle forto leerne, knowe, and haue sufficientli into mannis bihoue and into Goddis trewe seruice and lawe keping what is to be leerned and kunnen aboute vsure, as to reeders and studiers ther yn it muste needis be open.</P>

And also thou&yogh; Holi Scripture bidde that we tempte not God amys and a&yogh;ens resoun, certis resoun techith the same.

<P>Confirmacioun to this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument is this: Euery thing groundid hangeth and is dependent of his ground, so that he mai not be withoute his ground; but so it is, that al the leernyng and kunnyng which Holi Scripture &yogh;eueth upon eny of the scid gouer|nauncis, vertues, deedis, or treuthis, and al the other deel of kunnyng upon hem which Scripture &yogh;eueth not, hangeth not of Holi Scripture, neither requirith and askith Holi Scripture forto so &yogh;eue.

<P>THE iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument into the same firste and principal conclusioun is this: Bifore that eny positijf lawe of God, that is to seie, eny voluntaire or wilful assignement of God, was &yogh;ouen to the Iewis fro the long tyme of Adamys comyng out of Paradijs into the tyme of circumcisioun in the daies of Abraham, and into the positijf lawe &yogh;ouen bi Moyses, the peple lyueden and seruiden God and weren bounde weelni&yogh; bi alle tho moral vertues and moral gouernauncis and treuthis whiche bi doom of her natural resoun thei founden and leerneden and camen to, and so thei weren bounde<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>bo&umacr;d&emacr;</I>, MS.; but the stroke over the <I>e</I> has been erased.

Aftirward, whanne tyme of Iewis came and the positijf lawe of the cerymonyes, iudicialis, and sacramentalis weren &yogh;ouen to the Iewis, the othere now bifore seid lawis of resoun weren not reuokid, but thei contynueden into charge of the Iewis with the lawis of cerymonies, 
<PB REF="00000129.tif" N="19"> iudicialis, and sacramentis, so that the Iewis weren chargid with alle the lawis of resoun with whiche the peple fro Adam thidir to weren chargid and also ouer that with the positijf lawis of God thanne &yogh;ouen. Forwhi it is not rad that the lawis of resoun weren thanne reuokid, and also needis alle men musten graunte that summe of hem abode charging the Iewis, and skile is ther noon whi summe of hem so abode and not alle; wherfore it is to be holde that alle tho lawis of resoun with whiche the peple were chargid bifore the tyme of Iewis aboden, stille charging also the Iewis into the tyme of Cristis passioun.</P>
<P>And thanne ferther, thus: Whanne Crist prechid and suffrid, alle the peple of Iewis were chargid with the hool lawe of kinde and of resoun and with al the positijf lawe of cerimonies iudicialis and oold sacramentis, but so it is that to Cristen men succed|ing next after the Iewis weren not reuokid eny lawis bi Crist and his newe lawe saue the positijf lawis of cerymonies iudicialis and oolde sacramentis: wherfore in to the charge of Cristen men abidith &yogh;it the hool birthen which was to the Iewis, excepte the birthen of cerymonies iudicialis and oold sacramentis, so that in to the charge of Cristen men abidith the al hool birthen of lawe of kinde which is not ellis than moral philsophie, which was birthen and charge bothe to the Iewis and to alle peplis bifore the Iewis fro Adamys comyng out of Paradijs. And sithen it is not founde in the Newe Testament that Crist made eny positijf lawe bisidis the oolde law of kinde and of resoun which euere was bifore, except oonli his positijf lawe of hise newe sacramentis with whiche he chargid the peple of Cristen, instide of<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>of the</I>, MS.; but <I>the</I> is cancelled by a later (?) hand.</NOTE> cerymonies iudicialis and oold sacramentis with whiche the Iewis weren chargid, 
<PB REF="00000130.tif" N="20"> it folewith that Cristen peple abiden &yogh;it hidir to chargid with the seid ful al hool moral lawe of kinde, and with the positijf lawis of Cristis newe sacramentis, so that welny&yogh; or weel toward the al hool lawe with which Cristen men ben chargid is mad of lawe of kinde, which is doom of resoun and moral philsophie as of the oon partie, and of lawe of the newe sacramentis, which is lawe of newe feith, as of the other partie. And if this be trewe, as it is openli and cleerli ynou&yogh; lad forth to be trewe, it muste nedis folewe that welny&yogh; or weel toward al the hool lawe of God in tyme of the Newe Testament, except a fewe positijf lawis of Cristis fewe newe sacramentis, is not ellis than the same lawe of kinde which was long bifore the tyme of Abraham and of Iewis.</P>
<P>And thanne ferther ther of y argue thus: But so it is that al thilk now seid lawe of kinde which was bifore the tyme of Iewis, not withstonding it is the more partie of Cristen lawe now bi ful greet quantite, is not foundid in Holi Scripture of the Newe Testa|ment, neither in Holi Scripture of the Oold Testament, neither in hem bothe to gidere. Forwhi this lawe was whanne neither of the Newe neither of the Oold Tes|tament writing was, and that fro the tyme of Adam into Abraham, wherfore folewith that thilk lawe &yogh;it abiding to Cristen men is not groundid in Holi Scrip|ture, but in the book of lawe of kinde writen in mennis soulis with the finger of God as it was so groundid and writen bifore the daies of Abraham and of Iewis. Whi in this iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument y haue seid these wordis welny&yogh; or weel toward schal appere and be seen bi what schal be seid aftir in proofis of the vij<SUP>e</SUP>. and x<SUP>e</SUP>. conclusiouns, and more openli by the place there alleggid in the book clepid <I>The iust apprising of Holi Scripture</I>.</P>
<P>The iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument is this, What euer 
<PB REF="00000131.tif" N="21"> thing oonli remembrith, stirith, and exortith, or bid|dith or counseilith men forto kepe certein gouer|nauncis, vertues, and treuthis groundith not as in that tho gouernauncis, vertues, and treuthis. Forwhi as in that he presupposith tho gouernauncis, vertues, and trouthis to be bifore knowen of tho same men, and ellis in waast he schulde so speke to tho men of hem not bifore knowen; and ther fore as in that he not hem groundith. But so it is that Holi Scripture dooth not ellis aboute the moral vertues and gouer|nauncis and treuthis of Goddis moral lawe and seruice bifore seid in the firste conclusioun, saue oonli this, that he remembrith, or exortith, or biddith, or counseilith men upon tho vertues and gouernauncis and forto vse hem, and forto flee the contrarie vicis of hem, as ech man mai se bi reding where euere he wole where men|sioun is mad of eny moral vertu in the Oold Testa|ment or of the Newe. For he biddith a man to be meke, and he techith not bifore what mekenes is. He biddith a man to be pacient, and &yogh;it he not bifore techith what pacience is. And so forth of ech vertu of Goddis lawe. Wherfore no such seid gouernaunce or vertu or trouthe is to be seid groundid in Holi Scrip|ture, no more than it ou&yogh;te be seid if a bischop wolde sende a pistle or a lettre to peple of his diocise, and ther yn wolde remembre hem, exorte hem, and stire hem, and bidde hem or counseile hem forto kepe cer|teyn moral vertues of lawe of kinde, that therfore tho moral vertues and pointis of lawe of kinde writen in thilk epistle weren groundid in thilk epistle of the bischope; for noon other wise vpon such seid vertues Poul wrote in hise epistlis, neither Petir, neither Iame, neither Iohun, neither Iudas wroten in her epistlis and writingis.</P>
<P>Confirmacioun to this argument mai be this: If the King of Ynglond dwellid in Gascony, and wolde sende a noble longe letter or epistle into Englond, 
<PB REF="00000132.tif" N="22"> bothe to iugis and to othere men, that ech of hem schulde kepe the pointis of the lawe of Englond, and thou&yogh; he wolde reherce tho pointis and gouer|nauncis, vertues,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>and vertues</I>, MS.; but <I>and</I> is cancelled.</NOTE> and trouthis of the lawe forto re|membre the iugis and the peple ther upon, and thou&yogh; he schulde stire and prouoke, and exorte, bidde, or counseile hem therto, &yogh;it it ou&yogh;te not be seid that thilk epistle<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>pistle</I>, MS.; <I>e</I> added above in a different hand.</NOTE> groundid eny of tho lawis or gouernauncis of Englond, for her ground is had to hem bifore thilk epistle of the King, and that bi acte and decre of the hool Parliament of Englond which is verry ground to alle the lawis of Englond, thou&yogh; thilk epistle of the King or of the Duke had not be writun; and at the leest he in thilk bidding presupposith tho deedis to be knowen bifore of hem to whom he biddith tho deedis to be kept as lawis. Wherfore bi lijk skile, thou&yogh; Crist and thou&yogh; Poul and othere Apostlis wroten to peple epistlis or lettris or othere writingis, &yogh;it sithen tho truthis which thei so wroten weren groundid bifore tho writingis and hengen upon the doom of resoun which is lawe of kinde and moral philsophie and schulden bi dewte haue be kept of men thou&yogh; tho writingis hadden not be maad, it folewith that tho spoken gouernauncis ou&yogh;ten not be trowid groundid in the now seid writingis of Crist or of the Apostlis. Who euer mai seie that eny thing was bifore his ground, and ou&yogh;te be thou&yogh; his ground were not, and thou&yogh; his ground had not be? Wherfore needis folewith that the firste bifore sett and principal conclusioun is trewe.

<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument into the same firste and principal conclusioun is this: Who euer in his speche bi which he spekith of a gouernaunce or treuthe presupposith the same gouernaunce to be knowen bifore his same speche and to be knowen eer<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>heer</I>, MS.; but the first letter is in paler ink, and <I>eer</I> is no doubt the reading intended by the corrector.</NOTE> he so ther of spekith or spak, he as in thilk speche groundith not thilk gouernaunce or trouthe; for thanne the thing groundid schulde be bifore his ground. But so it is, that whanne euere Holi Scripture or Crist or Apostle spekith or spak of eny of the seid gouernauncis or moral trouthis thei in the same speche presupposen the same gouernaunce to be bifore her speking ther of. Forwhi in thilke spechis thei bidden or counseilen or exorten or remembren to men tho deedis to be doon of hem; and who euer so dooth presupposith the same deedis to be bifore knowen of hem to whom tho deedis ben so beden, counseilid, exortid, or remembrid to be doon, as it is bifore seid in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument. And also in thilk speche thei speken of the gouer|naunce not as of a thing which thei thanne first maken, but as of thing<NOTE PLACE="foot">The indefinite article should probably be inserted.</NOTE> bifore being eer eny lawe was &yogh;ouen to the Iewis, as it is ri&yogh;t euydent that Crist and hise Apostlis it weel knowen and in to whos performyng thei remembren men and stiren and prouoken. Wherfore needis folewith that noon such seid gouernaunce is groundid in eny speche of Holi Scripture or of Crist or of Apostle.
<PB REF="00000134.tif" N="24"></P>
<P>The vj<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument into the same firste and principal conclusioun is this: No sufficient cause hast thou forto seie and holde that Holi Scripture groundith eny of the gouernauncis, trouthis, and vertues bifore seid in the firste conclusioun saue this, that in Holi Scripture mensioun is maad that thei ben treuthis; but this is not sufficient cause forto ther bi thus seie and holde. Wherfore noon sufficient cause hast thou forto seie and holde that Holi Scripture groundith eny of the gouernauncis, trouthis, and vertues spoken of in the firste principal conclusion.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of this vj<SUP>e</SUP>. argument may be proued thus: If thilk now seid cause were sufficient forto so holde, thanne, sithen Holi Scripture makith mensioun M<SUP>t</SUP>. xvi<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. of treuthis longing to natural philsophi and approueth hem there weel to be treuthis, it wolde folewe that Holi Scripture groundith treuthis of na|tural philsophie; which no wijs man wole graunte: wherfore the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of this vj<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is trewe. Schal y seie for this that Crist rehercith Math. xvj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., how that <I>whanne heuen is rody in the euentid a cleer dai schal be the morewe, and whanne in the morntide heuene schineth heuyli in thilk dai schal be tempest</I>, that in Holi Scripture this treuthe of natural philsophie now rehercid bi Crist or the leernyng and kunnyng ther of is groundid in tho wordis of Crist and is groundid in the Gospel? Alle men witen nay. Forwhi the kunnyng ther of was had eer Crist there and thanne tho wordis spake, and no thing is bifore his owne ground, and the kunnyng of thilk mater is largir in his ground which is natural philsophi than is many hool chapitris to gidere ligging in Matheu. And &yogh;it bi lijk skile it schulde be holde and seid that the now rehercid pointis of natural philsophie were groundid there, if eny oon point of the seid moral philsophie were groundid in Holi Scripture; wherfore sithen thilk 
<PB REF="00000135.tif" N="25"> kunnyng of cleernes and of derknes in the dai is not groundid in the Gospel thou&yogh; the Gospel make a schort rehercel ther of, it folewith bi lijk skile that of no moral vertuose gouernauncis the sufficient kunnyng is groundid in Holi Writt, sithen al Holi Writt techith not forth the ful and sufficient and necessarie kun|nyng of eny oon moral vertu in Goddis lawe or Goddis seruice, thou&yogh; of many of hem Holi Scrip|ture makith schort remembrauncis to us that we schulde hem kepe and not a&yogh;ens hem do. And it is welny&yogh; al that Holi Writt dooth or namelich en|tendith forto teche aboute eny moral vertu or point of Goddis moral lawe: and Goddis forbode that this litle were sufficient ground of the ful hool leernyng neces|sarie to be had upon eny oon such seid point of Goddis lawe and seruice, for thanne not oon such seid point of Goddis lawe and seruice schulde or my&yogh;te be sufficientli leerned and kunne. Schal y seie that an hous hauyng an hundrid feet in brede is groundid upon lond in which he takith not but oon foot? Goddis forbode y schulde be so lewde forto so seie. Forwhi miche rather y ou&yogh;te seie that this hous takith his grounding upon thilk lond in which ben alle the feetis mesuris of the same hous, and therfore nedis ech witti man muste graunte that the first principal con|clusioun bifore sett is trewe.</P>
<P>Of whiche first principal conclusioun thus proued folewith ferther this corelarie, that whanne euere and where euere in Holi Scripture or out of Holi Scrip|ture be writen eny point or eny gouernaunce of the seide lawe of kinde it is more verrili writen in the book of mannis soule than in the outward book of parchemyn or of velym; and if eny semyng dis|corde be bitwixe the wordis writen in the outward book of Holi Scripture and the doom of resoun, write in mannis soule and herte, the wordis so writen withoutforth ou&yogh;ten be expowned and be interpretid 
<PB REF="00000136.tif" N="26"> and brou&yogh;t forto accorde with the doom of resoun in thilk mater; and the doom of resoun ou&yogh;te not forto be expowned, glosid, interpretid, and brou&yogh;te for to accorde with the seid outward writing in Holi Scripture of the Bible or ou&yogh;where ellis out of the Bible. Forwhi whanne euer eny mater is tretid bi it which is his ground and bi it which is not his ground, it is more to truste to the treting which is mad ther of bi the ground than bi the treting ther of bi it which is not ther of the ground; and if thilke ij. tretingis ou&yogh;ten not discorde, it folewith that the treting doon bi it which is not the ground ou&yogh;te be<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>to be</I>, MS.; <I>to</I> is cancelled by a later hand.</NOTE> mad for to accord with the treting which is maad bi the ground. And therfore this corelarie conclusioun muste nedis be trewe.</P>
<P>More, for proof of the firste principal conclusioun and of al what is seid fro the bigynnyng of the same first principal conclusion hidir to, is sette and writen in the book clepid <I>The iust apprising of Holi Scripture</I>, which book if he be rad and be weel vnderstonde thoru&yogh;out, hise iij. parties schal conferme vndoutabli al what is seid here fro the bigynnyng of the firste principal conclusioun hider to.</P>
<P>Weel y woot that not withstonding no verri and trewe grounding (propirli forto speke of ground|ing) is saue such as is now spoken of in the firste and ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argumentis to the firste conclusioun, &yogh;it whanne a mater or a trouthe is witnessid or affermed or denouncid or mad be remembrid to per|soones, and that bi a reuerend and worthi witnesser or denouncer or remembrer (as is God, an Apostil, or a Doctour), thanne thilk witnessing or denouncing or remembraunce making is woned be clepid a grounding of the same mater or trouthe so witnessid,

<P>THE iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: It is not the office longing to moral lawe of kinde for to grounde eny article of feith groundid by Holi Scripture. For whi al that the now seid moral lawe of kinde or moral philsophie groundith is groundid bi doom of mannis resoun, and therfore is such a treuthe and a conclusioun that into his fynding, leernyng, and know|ing mannis witt mai bi it silf aloone or bi natural helpis withoute reuelacioun fro God rise and suffice. But so it is that noon article of feith mai be groundid

Forwhi thanne feith were no feith, as it is tau&yogh;t in <I>The folwer to the donet</I> and in the book <I>Of feith and of sacramentis</I> in Latyn. Wherfore moral lawe of kinde, (which is not ellis than moral philsophie writen depe in mannis soule, there ligging with the prent and the ymage of God,) mai not grounde eny article or treuthe or conclu|sioun of feith: but into the grounding of feith serueth Holi Scripture, as it is bi the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. conclusioun proued.

<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: Thou&yogh; neither the seide moral lawe of kinde neither outward bokis therof writen mowe grounde eny trouthe or con|clusioun of verry feith, &yogh;it tho outward bokis (as Cristene men hem maken) mowe weel ynow reherce and witnesse trouthis and conclusiouns of feith groundid bifore in Holi Scripture; and so thei doon.

But so it is that bokis of Holi Scripture rehercen treuthis longing to the grounding of moral philsophie, as it is bifore schewid in proof of the secunde conclusion; wherfore it is not repugnant that bokis of moral philsophie, namelich tho whiche Cristen men maken, reherce treuthis of feith longing to the grounding of Holi Scripture.

<P>The vj<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: The hool office and werk into which ben ordeyned the bokis of moral philsophie (writen and mad bi Cristen men in the maner now bifore spoken in the v<SUP>e</SUP>. conclusioun) is forto expresse outwardli bi writing of penne and ynke the treuthis and conclusiouns, whiche the inward book of lawe of kinde, biried in mannis soule and herte, groundith; and forto reherce summe treuthis and conclusiouns of feith longing to the grounding of Holi Scripture, that the reders be the more and the oftir remembrid and stirid and exortid bi thilk rehercing into tho treuthis of feith so rehercid. Of whiche summe ben positijf lawis, as ben oonli the treuthis aboute the newe sacramentis of Crist and aboute the vsis of hem: and summe ben not lawis, as that thre persoones ben oon God, and that the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. of hem was mad man, and that he died and roos fro deeth, and so forth.

<P>The vij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: The more deel and party of Goddis hool lawe to man in erthe, and that bi an huge gret<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>gret</I> is interlineated in a later hand.</NOTE> quantite ouer the remanent parti of the same lawe, is groundid sufficiently out of Holi Scripture in the inward book of lawe of kinde and of moral philosphie,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>philsophie</I>, so the MS. originally, but a later hand, contrary to the usage of the MS., has corrected it to <I>philosophie</I>.</NOTE> and not in the book of Holi Scrip|ture

<P>That the now bifore seid vndirstonding, whiche thei &yogh;euen to the firste of the iij. textis, is vntrewe and vndew to him, y proue thus: Whanne Poule wroot thilk first texte i.

Wherfore Poul meened not and vndirstode not in thilke wordis forto speke of the writing of the al hool Bible, or of the writing of the Newe Testament, of whiche neuer neither thanne was, that whoeuer knowith not thilk writing he schal be vnknowun of God. That in thilk tyme, whanne Poul wrote tho wordis, the al hool writing of the Newe Testament

Also, whanne Poul wrote the firste text, the Apocalips was not writen; forwhi Iohun wrote the Apocalips whanne he was in exile in Pathmos, as he seith him silf the [first]<NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the number.</NOTE> chapiter of the Apocalips; and in thilk exile he was not bifore the laste &yogh;eer of Domician, Emperour of Rome.

Wherfore the Euangelie of God is not the writing of the Newe Testament, for thanne the same thing had be bifore him silf, and eer than he was him silf, which includith repugnaunce. That the Euangeli of God was, bifore and eer than eny word was writen of the Newe Testament, y proue thus: The Euangelie of God which was to be denouncid to alle peple was in the dai in which Crist stied up into heuen: forwhi he seide thanne to hise disciplis: <I>Go &yogh;e, and preche &yogh;e the Euangelie to ech creature</I>.

<P>A GREET cause whi thei of the lay parti which han vsid the hool Bible or oonli the Newe Testament in her modris langage han holde the seid first opinioun was this, that the reeding in the Bible, namelich in the historial parties of the Oold Testament and of the Newe, is miche delectable and sweete, and drawith the reders into a deuocioun and a loue to God and fro loue and deinte of the world; as y haue had her of experience upon<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>vupon</I>, MS.

<P>BUT certis more scharpeli here risen ij. obiecciouns, whiche the holders of the firste opinioun mi&yogh;ten make a&yogh;ens me bi resoun thus: Mannys resoun is a thing whiche in hise doomys and iugementis ofte failith, as experience ofte schewith. Wherfore it my&yogh;te seme that God wolde not him to be oure reule in deedis of oure seruice to God. Forwhi this, that God schulde make vs forto leene to a thing deceyuyng and failing forto performe his seruice, bisittith<NOTE PLACE="foot">The MS. has been corrected from <I>bisittith</I> into <I>bisettith.</I> </NOTE> not his wisdom as it wolde seme. The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. obiectioun is this: Holi Scrip|ture is a reuerend thing and a worthi, sythen that bi it and fro it al the Cristen Chirche of God takith her feith. Wherfore it mi&yogh;te seme that God wolde not subdewe or submitte and remytte and sende him to resoun, for to be interpretid and be expowned and dressid into trewe and dewe sense and vndirstonding; and that bothe for resoun is a reule failing in his doom, and al so for that Holi Scriptures affermyng vpon a mater is more worthi than is the doom of mannis resoun. And therfore sithen, as it semeth, God not so reulith him in hise gouernauncis, that he &yogh;eueth a reule which is not sufficient forto reule, or that he puttith the worthier thing vndir reule of the vnworthier thing, it mi&yogh;te seme miche of al what y haue bifore tau&yogh;t in this present book be vntrewe.
<PB REF="00000184.tif" N="74"></P>
<P>To the firste of these ij. obiecciouns y answere thus: It is ful profitable to mankinde that he haue of seable treuthis sure knowing, and that bi si&yogh;t of i&yogh;en; and &yogh;it what othere i&yogh;en or seing power hath God &yogh;ouen to mankinde forto therwith se, than which at sumtyme wolen faile and erre? It is also ful profitable to mankinde that he haue sure knowing of heereable treuthis, and that bi heering of eeris; and &yogh;it what othere eeris or power of heering hath God &yogh;oue to man, than which at sumtyme schulen faile and erre in deemyng? Is it not profitable to man|kinde forto move fro oon place into an other place redili and ri&yogh;tli and sureli with leggis and feet? And &yogh;it what othere feet or leggis hath God &yogh;oue to man, than whiche schulen at sumtyme slide and at sumtyme stumble fro the ri&yogh;t going and moving? And if this be trewe, certis thou&yogh; it be ful profitable to mankinde forto knowe with and bi the power of resoun resonable trouthis, (that is to seie suche as mowe not be knowe bi seing or heering or eny out|ward sensitijf wit,) and also tho<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the</I>, MS. (first hand).</NOTE> same treuthis whiche outward sensityue wittis knowen, it is not merveil, thou&yogh; God &yogh;eue noon other power of resoun to man forto bi it knowe these treuthis, than whiche power of resoun schal<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>schat</I>, MS.</NOTE> at sumtyme and ofte faile in his re|sonyng and iuging. And, namelich, herfore it is the lasse merveil. For bi cause that God hath &yogh;ouen to vs noon othere i&yogh;en and power of seing than whiche wolen at sumtime erre, and noon other power of heer|ing than whiche wolen at sumtime erre, and noon othere feet than whiche wolen ofte slide and stumble; therfore if we do oure diligence and bisynes forto kepe as weel as we mowen and kunnen oure power of seing that he erre not, oure power of heering that 
<PB REF="00000185.tif" N="75"> he erre not, oure feet that thei slide not and stumble not, God wole holde us excusid, thou&yogh; oure power of seing erre, and thou&yogh; oure power of heering erre, and thou&yogh; oure feet stumble; and it schal be allowid to us as miche of God as if it be seen ari&yogh;t, herd ari&yogh;t, and walkid ari&yogh;t. And euen so, bi cause that God hath &yogh;ouen to vs noon other power of resonyng than which may faile and erre, he wole holde us excusid, thou&yogh; we folewe an erroneose doom of resoun, whilis we ben not necligent but diligent bothe in oure owne avising and bi counseil taking of othere forto haue a ri&yogh;t doom in oure resoun; and he wole allowe, rewarde, accepte, and take oure deede which we doon bi such an erroneose doom, as ferforth as it were doon bi a ri&yogh;t doom; al the while that thilk errour in oure resounys doom is had a&yogh;ens oure wil, and not bi oure consent and willing or necligence. And so, if this be trewe, (as it is proued be trewe in othere placis of my writingis,) noon inconuenience is, if God ordeyne the power of resoun for to be oure reule in his seruice doing, thou&yogh; thilk power of reson be such that he schal sumtime (&yogh;he, and ofte tyme) erre, but if the gretter laboure be mad thera&yogh;ens bi avisingis and bi counseil taking and bi leernyng long tyme in scolis.</P>
<P>Neuertheles it may be answerid to the firste obiec|cioun in other wise thus: That the power of resoun in him silf is not ordeyned of God to be oure next and best and surest reuler or reule anentis alle resonable treuthis, but the doom of reson is ordeyned to so be; and &yogh;it not ech doom of resoun, but thilk doom of resoun which is a formal complete argument clepid a sillogisme in resoun, whos bothe premissis ben sureli or likeli knowen for trewe, and that bi hem silf or bi sume othere bifore had lijk sillogisme or sillogismes prouyng the premisse hauyng nede to be proued, into tyme it bicome into premissis openest in suerte or openest in probabilite or likelihode. And 
<PB REF="00000186.tif" N="76"> certis this doom of resoun (in this wise had) failith neuere, neither may in eny tyme erre. For if y be sikir aud suer in my resoun that no man is in the chirche of Seint Poul at Londoun, and that the bischop of London is a man, y mai be sekir and sure that the bischop of London is out of the chirche of Seint Poul at London, thou&yogh; alle aungels in heuen wolde seie the contrarie. And cause of this suerte is that the doom of resoun is had bi such a formal sillogisme as is now seid. And in lijk maner suerte of knowing is had bi ech other of the xix. maners or chaungis of sillogismes tau&yogh;t in logik bi opene reulis. Lete ther|fore ech man abide in his resonyng in what euer mater of resonyng he hath to do, in to tyme he be sure that he hath suche seid sillogismes; and he schal neuere be deceyued. So that al the cause whi men ben deceyued in resonyng is her hastynes, that thei wole iuge bi schorte argumentis, eer tho argumentis ben reducid into formes of sillogismes; or ellis for that thei trusten and trowen the premisse be trewe, eer that thei seen the premisses sufficientli proued bi sillogizing, into tyme it be come up into premissis so open in sure trouthe or ellis so open in proba|bilite, that noon nede is that eny other premisse be take forto proue hem; or ellis for that thei knowen not bi reulis &yogh;ouen therto whanne an argument is a formal sillogisme, and whanne he so is not. Sotheli, if a man wole reule him thus, he schal neuere be bigiled aboute maters of resoning; forwhi ther is noon con|clusioun or trouthe in the world, (except tho which ben open bi experience of sensitijf witt or at fulle pleyn in resoun, whiche ben clepid groundis and foun|damentis to alle the othere treuthis and conclusiouns in philsophie, and aboute which no man schal erre, bi cause thei ben so openli trewe), but that into proof of it mai be had a sillogisme weel reulid. And thanne if the bothe premissis be knowen at fulle for sure 
<PB REF="00000187.tif" N="77"> trouthis, the conclusioun is to be take for sure trouthe; and if the bothe premyssis be knowun not for sure trouthis, but for suche that for the more parti thei ben trewe and seeldem fallith the contrarie that thei ben vntrewe, or if oon of the premissis be such as is now seid and the other is sure trouthe, thanne the conclusioun is knowen as probabili or likeli trewe.</P>
<P>And this difference here now touchid is the differ|ence bitwix a demonstratijf sillogisme and a probable sillogisme, that is to seie bitwixe a sillogisme which &yogh;eueth sure and vndoutable kunnyng and a sillogisme which &yogh;eueth probable kunnyng oonli, that is to seie kunnyng of likelihode and of opinioun but not of cer|teinte. And so no treuthe is a this side the openest fundamental treuthis, but that into proof of him mai be had a sillogisme weel reulid forto proue him sureli trewe, or forto proue him likeli to be trewe; &yogh;he, and so likeli to be trewe that he is rather to be holde for trewe than for vntrewe, and that he is to be holde trewe into tyme<NOTE PLACE="foot">The word <I>into</I> seems required before <I>his</I>.</NOTE> his contrarie parti be had strenger and euydenter premissis than ben the premyssis whiche ben had into him now. And euen as a pre|misse, whos suer knowing is lokid aftir and sou&yogh;t after, is to be resolued bi arguyng of sillogismes in the maner now seid, into tyme it be come into pre|missis of openest suerte; so whanne eny premysse is such that his suer trouthe is not lokid aftir neither sou&yogh;t after, but his probabilite or likelihode of trouthe is lokid aftir and sou&yogh;t aftir, he is to be resolued upward bi sillogismes, into tyme it be come vp into premyssis of whiche euere either is openest in likeli|hode thou&yogh; not in suerte, or ellis into premyssis of which oon<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>ooon</I>, MS.</NOTE> is openest in suerte of trouthe and the other is openest in suerte of likelihode or of proba|bilite 
<PB REF="00000188.tif" N="78"> a this side suerte. So that as ther ben principlis openest in suerte to treuthis whos suer kunnying is sou&yogh;t aftir to be had, so ther ben principlis openest in probabilite or likelihode to treuthis whos likeli kun|nyng or probable kunnyng is sou&yogh;t aftir to be had, and whos suer kunnyng is not sou&yogh;t aftir to be had.</P>
<P>If ensaumplis weren sett to al this doctrine, weel y woot the doctrine wolde be vndirstonde the bettir. But certeinli it were ouerlong for this book for to sette out al the ful doctrine which is now here attained of sillogizing for sure kunnyng, and of sillogizing for probable or likeli kunnyng; and forto sett therto sufficient ensaumplis were ouer it miche lenger. And therfore y must here therof abstene and forber. But &yogh;it thou&yogh; y schal not be vnderstonde sufficientli of the lay reders in this bifore going proces (namelich at the first), and not with oute studie and labour in her partie, me thinkith y muste needis seie so miche ther of as y haue now seid; for ellis thei wolden weene that a good clerk couthe not assoile the firste obiec|cioun, which y am sikir thei wolden make. And y haue leefir forto seie sumwhat of the trewe substancial answere longing therto, thou&yogh; y schulde not be suffi|cientli ther yn vnderstonde of hem, than forto seie not of such sufficient answere bi cause of her insufficience of vndirstonding, and therbi forto suffre vntrewe dif|fame falle to the clergie, and hem forto rise into pre|sumpcioun of trowing that thei han kunnyng more than thei han, and that thei han noon or litle nede to groundli clerkis. Wherfore who mai not or cannot vnderstonde this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. answere to the firste obieccioun, take he him to the firste now bifore seid answere to the same obieccioun; for bothe ben gode ynou&yogh;, and bothe (thou&yogh; in her dyuerse maners) ben trewe, sithen the doom of resoun may not be oure next reule in doing Goddis seruice, but if resoun were the romber reule to vs into the same doing of Goddis seruice, bi 
<PB REF="00000189.tif" N="79"> cause that the doom of resoun cometh out and fro the resoun, as the li&yogh;t of the sunne comith fro the sunne.</P>
<P>Aftir that y haue schewid thus: That noon incon|uenient is, thou&yogh; God assigne for oure reule into his seruice the power of resoun in oon maner of reuling, as a power of deedis hath forto reule; and also aftir that y haue schewid thus: That the doom of resoun mi&yogh;te be a surer reule to us into Goddis moral ser|uice than is the power of reson,&mdash;now y schal schewe that euereither of hem is needis to be seid oure reule into the moral seruice of God to be doon. And firste thus: Of al the moral seruice of God, which is moral lawe of kinde, Holi Scripture is not the reule. Forwhi than therof Holi Scripture were the ground, which is proued bifore to be vntrewe: Also of al the now seid moral seruice of God, Holi Scripture is oonli a witnesser and a rehercer, and takith it out and fro moral lawe of kinde and out of moral philsophie, as it is bifore proued. Wherfore Holi Scripture is not neither may be reuler of thilk moral lawe and seruice to God. And thanne thus: Of thilk now seid moral lawe and seruice to God Holi Scripture muste be reuler, or sumwhat ellis bisidis Holi Scripture muste be ther of the reuler; but now and bifore it is proued that Holi Scripture may not be ther of the reuler, bi cause he is not therof the grounder, and he is ther of oonli the rehercer and witnesser, and taker of it fro an other which is grounder. And herwith it is also open that noon othir thing bisidis Scripture can be assigned forto be ther of the reule or reuler, but if it were the seid doom of resoun mad in forme of sillogisme as the next and best reule, and the power of resoun as for the romber and ferther reule; in as miche as fro the power of resoun cometh forth the now seid doom of resoun. Wherfore needis it muste be grantid, no man may it avoide, that bothe resoun which is the power of resonyng and of deemyng, and 
<PB REF="00000190.tif" N="80"> the seid sillogistik doom of resoun ben in her bothe dyuerse maners reulis of al oure moral seruice to God, whiche is moral lawe of kinde, and of al oure lawe to God noon except, whether thei ben lawis of feith or not of feith; for noon of hem can be knowen of us withoute a sillogisme.

<P>FOR answere to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. obieccioun: Sithen it is so that Holi Scripture hath not to do in him silf forto reule eny trouthe or gouernaunce of natural philsophi or of moral philsophi and of moral lawe of kinde, which he rehercith, witnessith, or tretith, and as of hem he rehersith, witnessith, and tretith, (for this is ofte bifore schewid and proued,) and for that he is reule oonli of feithis whiche he tretith and techith, bi cause that oonli of hem he is founder and grounder; and therfore of tho treuthis and conclusiouns of moral lawe of kinde as thei ben witnessid in Holi Scripture sum thing muste be reule, ri&yogh;t as of hem sum thing muste be ground, and noon such thing can be avisid to be bisidis Holi Scripture forto be to hem reule and ground, saue the seid sillogistik doom of resoun in oon maner, and the power of resoun out of which thilk doom cometh and that in an other maner: (wherfore needis it muste be grauntid that bothe resoun which is the power of resonyng, and resoun which is the seid doom and sillogistik deede of resonyng ben in her ij. dyuerse maners reulis to Holi Scripture in alle the pointis of mannis moral seruice to God, noon except; and that for cause now late bifore sett and seid which is broddir declarid in <I>The folwer to the donet</I>, and is proued openli in the first parti of <I>The book of

<P>And ferthermore for answere to it that the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. ob|ieccioun alleggith Holi Scripture to be worthier than is the doom of resoun, and that therfore the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>that the</I>, MS.

For Holi Writt in this wise takun, is not holier neither better than eny other writing is<NOTE PLACE="foot">A later hand has joined <I>writing is</I>, so as to make <I>writingis</I>, but wrongly.</NOTE> which hath lijk good ynke, and is lijk craftili figurid. In an other maner, accordingli to this present purpos, Holi Writt is takun for the kunnyng wherbi the thing is kunne which is signified and bitokened bi the now seid out|ward Holi Writt writun in parchemyn or velym, or ellis mai be take for the outward writing, as it signifieth hise trouthis bitokened bi it, and as it is ioyned and couplid with the kunnyng of tho treuthis signified bi the outward writing. Also it is to vndir|stonde that doom of resoun mai be take in ij. wisis pertinentli, and accordingli to this present purpos. In oon maner doom of resoun is the deede of resonyng in mannis resoun, bi which the power of resoun (or 
<PB REF="00000192.tif" N="82"> the man bi the power of resoun) resoneth, making proposiciouns of simple wordis and termys knyt to gi|dere, and making sillogismys of proposiciouns kny&yogh;t to gidere bi teching of certein reulis: and in this maner oonli it is to be vnderstonde, as ofte as we han spoke ther of fro the bigynnyng of the xj<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter bifore hidir to. In another maner doom of resoun is take for the kunnyng of the conclusioun which is con|cludid in a sillogisme mad bi doom of resoun takun in the firste maner, and in this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner it is spokun bifore fro the bigynnyng of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter vnto the eende of the x<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter, weelni&yogh; alwey, whanne it is there spokun of doom of resoun, or ellis namelich whanne euere there doom of resoun is clepid lawe of kinde or moral philsophie, and comparisoun is mad there bitwixe lawe of kinde or doom of resoun and Holi Scripture. Now, Sir, if we now in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. obieccion bifore sett take Holi Scripture in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner, and doom of resoun in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner, sotheli Holi Writt in alle the now seid trouthis, conclusiouns, and gouernauncis, whiche he rehercith, denouncith, and techith of moral lawe of kinde, is vnworthier than is the moral lawe of kinde; and therfore is vnworthier than is sum doom of resoun takun in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner.

<P>Also thus: Of the same noumbre which holden the seid ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun manye vndirstonden a processe of Holi Scripture in oon maner and wolen needis so vn|dirstonde it, and manye othere of the same noumbre wolen needis vndirstonde the same processe in an other maner not according therto: and in this tho ij. soortis of men stryuen, and &yogh;it ech soort of hem holdeth him<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>holden hem</I> MS.

Wherfore bi open experience had among the holders of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun mai be openli knowe, that the same ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun is vntrewe.</P>
<P>Also thus: Open experience schewith that a viciose man is as kunnyng a clerk for to finde, leerne, and vndirstonde which is the trewe and dew sentence of Holi Scripture, how soone a vertuose clerk is kunnyng therto: and into the same vnderstondingis thei to 
<PB REF="00000204.tif" N="94"> gidere accordingli fallen. Wherfore experience con|uicteth the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun to be vntrewe.</P>
<P>Now forto proue the same ij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun to be vntrewe bi resoun, y procede thus: Forto fynde the verri and iust vndirstonding of processis in Holi Writt is a labour of the witt or of the intellect, or of resoun in bihold|ing aboute the circumstauncis of the proces and in resonyng ther upon; and forto be good and holi is a labour of the wil or of the affecte or of the appe|tite: but so it is, that a badde man and a ful yuel disposid man in wil and in affect mai haue so cleer and so weel disposid witt and reson into alle thingis to be founde bi witt, as hath a good man weel dis|posid in maners of his affect and wil: wherfore folew|ith bi resoun, that as soone may a viciose man come to and fynde the dew vndirstonding of Holi Scripture, how soone mai a vertuose man finde, so that thei ben lijk witti in nature, or so that the viciose man haue a cleerer witt than the vertuose man hath.</P>
<P>If eny man wole seie here, that this now mad ar|gument proueth weel that, as bi nature and kinde, so soone schulde a witti viciose man fynde and come to the verri trewe vndirstonding of Holi Scripture, as schulde a vertuose euen witti or lasse witti man; neuertheles so it is, that God &yogh;eueth not hise &yogh;iftis to a viciose man lijk plenteuoseli as he &yogh;eueth to a ver|tuose man.</P>
<P>A&yogh;ens this answere y mai meete thus: We han noon other knowing in experience but that men fynden and comen (as for the miche more parti) to the kun|nyng of Scripture and of alle othere divyne and godli trouthis rathir or latir, as thei ben disposid kindeli in her resoun and witt. And what euer ex|perience techith we ou&yogh;te holde, but if resoun or Scripture or sure reuelacioun schewe other. Wher|fore we ou&yogh;ten noon other holde, but if resoun or Scripture or other sure reuelacioun schulde enforme vs that we schulde other holde. For ellis the holding 
<PB REF="00000205.tif" N="95"> were feyned, and lackid euydence and ground. But so it is, that neithir sufficient resoun, neither Scripture, neither other sure revelacioun schewith to us forto holde other wise ther yn than experience schewith. Wherfore as experience schewith, so ther yn it is to be holde: and that is what is now bifore seid, that men comen into the dew vndirstonding of Scripture rathir or latir, as thei therto ben kindeli disposid. And ferthermore, thou&yogh; God schulde not and wolde not suffre eny man to haue the dew vndirstonding of Holi Scripture saue bi his &yogh;ifte, &yogh;it we mowe haue that hise &yogh;iftis and gracis of wit he &yogh;eue as plenteuoseli to a bad man as to a good man, and sumtyme more plenteuoseli to the lasse good man than to<NOTE PLACE="foot">Probably <I>the</I> should be inserted after <I>to</I>.</NOTE> better man. Forwhi ellis what euere men were prophetis, or what euere men hadden reuelaciouns, were holier than eny othere men whiche hadden noon reuelaciouns and visiouns; and the holier that eny man or womman is, the more he or sche hath prophecie and reuelacioun than an othir lasse holi; which is knowun as vntrewe bi open experience. Wherfore folewith that thou&yogh; God wolde not suffre eny man to haue the dew vnderstonding of Holi Scripture bi his natural witt, but bi &yogh;ifte of God, &yogh;it herwith stondith weel that a bad man haue as plen|teuosely thilk &yogh;ifte as a good man, and that sum bad man haue thilk &yogh;ifte more plenteuoseli than sum good man, ri&yogh;t as sum bad man or sum lasse good man hath &yogh;iftis of helth and of miraclis doing more plen|teuoseli &yogh;ouen to him than a good man or than a more good man, as it is open in the Gospel <NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the reference.

For whi ther is no treuthe knowun for a treuthe (whether it be a treuthe of lawe of kinde or of lawe of feith), but that if he be knowe perfitli and fulli bi hise euydencis and groundis, as it mai bi good labour of arguyng be knowe, he schal be proued trewe a&yogh;ens alle a&yogh;enseiers whiche euere thei ben, Cristen or hethen, and thei mowe bi strengthe of argument be constreyned in her reson for to consente therto, wole thei nile thei, if thei &yogh;eue sufficient attendaunce to the arguyng; and also sufficient cleer at fulle answere mai be &yogh;euun to al arguyng mad a&yogh;ens the same conclusioun of feith.

<P>Also that this iij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun is a&yogh;ens resoun it is euydent herbi: He is lijk to the lawe of Macomet and of Sarezenis in thilk point in which her lawe is moost vnresonable. Forwhi the lawe of Macomet biddith, vndir greet peyne of horrible deeth suffring, that no

<P>AFTIR y had herd and had writun thus as is now passid of these iij. opiniouns, ther came into my know|ing that among the peple bifore spokun is holde this iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. now to be rehercid opinioun.

<P>This iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun may ful li&yogh;tli be improued. For|whi a&yogh;ens him is had the grettist certeinte which mai be had in oure knowing, and it is clepid expe|rience: &yogh;he, such experience is a&yogh;ens him had, that the holders of him kunnen not and mowe not a&yogh;ens thilk experience seie nay, and therfore needis fro this iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun thei musten falle. As for the seid experience had a&yogh;ens the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun, sotheli y haue mad inquisicioun therto sufficient and diligent, and y am certified at fulle that among the holders of this same iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. opinioun summe ben founde and knowun openli among hem silf and of othere nei&yogh;boris to be greet lecchouris, summe to be avoutreris in greet haunt and contynuaunce, summe to be theefis, euen a&yogh;ens her owne leernyng and a&yogh;ens her owne holding and doctrine. &YOGH;he, thei that han be and ben ri&yogh;t grete in auctorite of teching among hem han be and ben suche, and in other wise miche viciose per|soones, so that thei mowe not here a&yogh;ens seie nay, for y can make it vndoutabili be proued.

<P>These iij. supposiciouns or reulis ben so openli trewe, that no man hauying eny quantite of resoun mai deneie hem. Forwhi, if y, being at Londoun in the Collage of Whitington, bidde or counseile or wit|nesse to my seruaunt there being with me, that he go to Poulis Cros forto heere there attentifli a sermon to be prechid, it muste nedis be grauntid, that y in

<P>Aftir these iij. so openli trewe reulis y putte forth iiij. conclusiouns, whiche muste needis be trewe, if these iij. reulis be trewe.</P>
<P>The firste of tho<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the</I>, MS. (first hand).</NOTE> iiij. conclusiouns is this: For this that Holi Scripture wole a man to loue God 
<PB REF="00000224.tif" N="114"> and drede God with al his herte, soul, and strengthe, it muste needis be grauntid that ther yn Holi Scripture wole a man to loue al what God wole him loue, and hate al what God wole him hate, and that Holi Scripture ther yn wole a man forto do Goddis seruicis whiche God biddith him to do, and forto do and suffre for God in his seruice. Forwhi al this folewith in formal argument fro this, that a man loueth God with al his herte, soul, and strengthe. Also it muste needis be grauntid, that ther yn and therbi Holi Scripture wole that a man bithinke and remembre upon these vij. maters, that is to seie, what God is in hise dignitees, nobilitees, and perfecciouns; whiche ben hise benefetis &yogh;ouen and bihi&yogh;t to man in this lijf and in the lijf to come; whiche ben hise pun|yschingis &yogh;ouun and to be &yogh;ouun in this lijf and in the lijf to come; whiche ben pointis and articlis of his lawe and his seruice; that man ther yn serue to him; whiche ben mannys natural freelnessis and yuel dispo|siciouns and redinessis into synne and lothinessis into good; whiche ben mannys synnes doon a&yogh;ens the lawe of God; and which ben remedies a&yogh;ens the now seid freelnessis and a&yogh;ens the now seid synnes. Forwhi the remembraunce and mynde taking upon these vij. maters is so necessarie a meene into the loue and drede of God, that withoute meditacioun and mynde vpon hem or upon summe of hem no man schal loue God and drede God in eny while with al his herte, soule, and strengthe. And ferthermore, sithen this mynde, remembraunce, and meditacioun mai not be had upon these seid maters withoute summe of these weies or meenes, that is to seie, reding or heering of Holi Scripture and of othere writingis, heering of sermons prechid, biholding upon picturis or purtraturis or graued werk or coruun werk, visiting and going into the placis in whiche holi men han lyued, or in whiche holi men dwellen, or in whiche the relifis or the re|likis of hem abiden; as bi whiche meenis alle or

This firste conclusioun folewith openli out of the iij. seid suppo|siciouns and reulis, and out of the ensaumpling bifore upon hem. Wherfore, if thei be trewe, this firste conclusioun muste nedis be trewe.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. conclusioun is this: Thilk xj. gouernauncis whiche y schal susteyne, meyntene, iustifie, and de|fende aftir in this present book, ben bede or counseilid or witnessid bi Holi Scripture to be doon. This conclusioun y proue thus. Ech gouernaunce which is expresseli bede, counseilid, or witnessid bi Holi Scrip|ture to be doon, or is includingli or closingli in eny of the now biforeseid maners bede, counseilid, or witnessid bi Holi Scripture to be doon, is bede or counseilid or witnessid [by] Holi Scripture to be doon; but so it is that ech of thilk now spokun xj. gouer|nauncis, which after in this present book y schal defende and susteyne, is a gouernaunce expresseli bede or counseilid or witnessid bi Holi Scripture to be doon, or is includingli or closingli bede, counseilid, or witnessid in summe of the maners now bifore seid in a gouernaunce bede, counseilid, or witnessid expresseli bi Holi Scripture to be doon, as schal be openli at ful proued after in this book.

<P>CONFIRMACIOUN to the i<SUP>e</SUP>. and ij<SUP>e</SUP>. of these iiij. now putt conclusiouns is this. Who euer for deuocioun and loue which he hath to Holi Scripture wole holde that ech gouernaunce of Goddis moral lawe and ser|uice is groundid in the Newe Testament, (as summen holden,) or in the hool Bible, (as summe othere hol|dun,) and ellis it is not to be take for a point and deede or gouernaunce of Goddis lawe and of Goddis seruice, &yogh;it he mai not holde and seie that needis ech gouernaunce of Goddis seid lawe and seruise muste be groundid expresseli in Holi Scripture, as anoon aftir schal be proued.

And if he muste so graunte, certis thanne if it be schewid to him that ech of the xj. gouernauncis whiche y schal aftir in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>., iij<SUP>e</SUP>., iv<SUP>e</SUP>., and v<SUP>e</SUP>. parties of this book defende and iustifie, (of which oon is setting up of ymagis in chirchis, and an othir is pilgrymage vnto the memorialis or mynde placis of Seintis,) is in|cludingli or closingli groundid or witnessid in Holi Scripture bi eny of the maners bifore seid in the iij. reulis, (as aftir in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti of this book it schal be schewid,) he muste needis lijk weel graunte that ech of tho xj. gouernauncis is groundid or witnessid in Holi Scripture.</P>

And &yogh;it ech of these deedis mowe be doon and ben doon vertuoseli and merytorili.</P>
<P>Also where in Holi Scripture is it grondid that men my&yogh;ten or schulden singe, saue oonli where yn thei preisiden God, as aungelis diden in erthe whanne Crist was born? And so for esement of a man him silf, and for esement of his nei&yogh;bour, it is not expressid in Holi Scripture that a man schulde singe. And &yogh;it Goddis forbode, but that into esement of him silf and also of his nei&yogh;bour, a man mai singe, pleie, and lau&yogh;e ver|tuoseli, and therfore merytorili; and if he mai do it merytorili, certis thanne thilk deede is Goddis seruice; and if it be Goddis seruice, it is needis a deede of Goddis lawe.</P>
<P>Where is it expressid bi word or bi eny persoonys ensaumpling in Holi Scripture that men schulden make 
<PB REF="00000231.tif" N="121"> ale or beer, of whiche so myche horrible synne cometh, myche more than of setting up of ymagis, or of pil|grymagis; and the defautis doon aboute ymagis and pilgrimagis ben myche li&yogh;ter and esier to be amendid, than the defautis comyng bi making of ale and of beer.

<P>That in Holi Scripture is noon of these now rehercid gouernauncis groundid or witnessid or ensaumplid bi eny persoon expresseli, lo, y proue thus: No thing is expresseli spoken of in Scripture, which is not there in special openli named; but so it is,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>is</I> is interlineated in a later hand, which has also made some erasures.</NOTE> that neither breche of lay man, neither gown, neither cloke, neither wommanis lynnen or silken couercheef, neither clock, neither Englisch tunge or langage,<NOTE PLACE="foot">After this follows, <I>neither Latyn tunge or langage</I>, but a later (?) hand has drawn a pen through it; rightly. See Luke xxiii. 38. But very possibly Pecock wrote it, since he was capable of making such a blunder as to say that a cloak is not mentioned in Scripture.</NOTE> neither ale, neither bere is spokun of there in special and bi name. Wher|fore the vce of these thingis, as to be doon bi tho thingis, is not there expressid. Also thus: No gouer|naunce or treuthe is expresseli groundid or witnessid in Holi Scripture, which mai not be knowen<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>knowe</I>, MS.

<PB REF="00000232.tif" N="122"> in the resoun of him which redith and vndir|stondith there the Scripture. Forwhi in this case thilk gouernaunce schulde be grondid or witnessid sumwhat and in parcel bi tho proposiciouns caste to Scripture, as it is groundid and witnessid sumwhat and in parcel bi the Scripture; but so it is, that noon of these now bifore spokun and rehercid gouernauncis may be knowe to be trewe, iust, and ri&yogh;tful bi eny text or processe in Scripture aloone, whilis no more at al in resoun is sett to the same Scripture, for to conclude the seid gouernance bi the Scripture and bi resoun to gidere. Wherfore noon of alle these seid gouernauncis is groundid or witnessid expresseli in Holi Scripture.</P>
<P>Confirmacioun herto is this: No thing is expressid or expresseli witnessid or groundid in Holi Scripture, which is not rehercid in Holi Scripture; but so it is, that noon of these gouernauncis is rehercid in Holi Scripture: wherfore noon of hem is expressid in Holi Scripture. And if noon of hem is there expressid, certis noon of hem is there expresseli groundid, wit|nessid, or denouncid, or tau&yogh;t.

<P>Now, Sir, to thee thus: In caas that y wolde holde a&yogh;ens thee, and seie that it is not to be do, that ale and beer be mad and drunke; or that wommen weere couerchefis of lynnen or of silk, of whiche so miche synne cometh; or if y wolde holde that it were not Goddis seruice forto at sum while lau&yogh;e or make

<P>Also thus: Whanne Poul seith that wommen schul|den haue couenable habit, he pointith not to hem which habit is couenable to hem and which is not couenable to hem; neither he pointith more speciali that for to were lynnen or silken couercheefis is co|uenable; or that it is not couenable. Wherfore forto haue al this pointid he remittith and sendith us sum|where ellis, and wole that we seche and fynde sum where ellis than in Holi Scripture which habit is couenable, and which is not couenable; but so it is, that into nowhere ellis he remittith us or sendith us or ou&yogh;te sende us for this purpos, saue in to doom of resoun and into lawe of kinde and moral philso|phie. Forwhi nowhere in Holi Scripture this mater is pointid and tau&yogh;t expresseli. Wherfore it was the entent of Poul in the seid proces, i<SUP>e</SUP>. Thim. ij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., that forto fynde, know, and iuge expresseli which habit is couenable, and whether forto were lynnen or silken couercheefis is couenable, we schulden go to doom of resoun and lawe of kinde.

Forwhi whanne Holi Scripture remittith from him or leueth to an other thing or sendith into an other thing eny certeyn kunnyng or knowing to be had, Holi Scripture not groundith, namelich not expresseli, thilk kunnyng and knowing; but the thing, into

Wherfore needis if it be leeful wommen forto were lynnen and silken couercheefis, doom of resoun muste expresseli grounde thilk wering; and Holi Scripture not so it groundith. Ensaumple for this purpos is this: If the king sende his epistle to alle peintouris, that thei peinte alle crucifixis with couenable colouris; certis it mai not be seid as here that thilk epistle groundith this, that whijt colour schal be leid in oon certein parti of the crucifix and reed in an other parti, and so forth of othere colouris; but the craft of peinting muste it grounde; and as for the grounding therof, the king in his epistle leueth hem to her owne craft. In lijk maner it were if the king bi his epistle wolde comaunde to goldsmythis, that whanne euer thei schulden enamele eny cuppe or other iewel, thei schulden enamele it couenabili; certis herbi the king schulde not grounde to hem, that there in such a place of the iewel thei schulden leie rather blew ena|meling than reed or whijt, and that in this place thei schulden<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>schulde</I>, MS.

For to conuicte and ouercome tho erring

<P>That this conclusioun is trewe y proue thus: For|to conuicte and ouercome tho seid erring persoones of the lay peple, and for to make hem leue her errouris, an excellent remedie is the dryuyng of hem into sure knowing or into weenyng or opinioun, that thei neden miche more to leerne and knowe into the profit and sure leernyng and knowing of Goddis lawe and seruice, than what thei mowe leerne and knowe bi her reed|ing and studiyng in the Bible oonli; but so it is, that forto dryue hem into the now seid knowing, trowing, or opinioun seruen at ful in an excellent maner the writing of this present firste parti in her modris lan|gage, with lijk writing of the book clepid <I>Iust ap|prising of Holi Scripture;</I> and bi so miche the better, if therto be sett the othere bokis named in these ij.

Wherfore for to conuicte the seid persoones and forto make hem leue her errouris is an excellent remedie, (&yogh;he, and as it were an vnlackeable remedie,) the seid writing of the now spoken bokis and the bitaking of tho seid bokis into the reeding and studi|yng of the same persoones.</P>
<P>The firste premisse of this proof and argument is trewe. Forwhi, if tho persoones were dryue into sure

<PB REF="00000248.tif" N="138"></P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: Numeri xxj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. it is writun, that God bade the peple of Israel forto make a brasen ymage of a serpent as for a signe, and forto sette him up an hi&yogh;e in the eend of a long pole for to be biholde of alle the peple: Wher|fore it mai not be that God, bi tho wordis seide to the same peple, <I>Thou schalt not make to thee eny graued thing</I>, that is to seie, not eny graued ymage, that bi tho wordis he vndirstode noon graued ymage to be mad. Forwhi thanne God had be contrarie to him silf; but if thou woldist seie that God wole now weel allowe the clergie forto haue and vse ymagis y&yogh;utte of gold and siluer and bras and of othere me|tallis, and noone ymagis graued of tre or of stoon: which seiyng is not but a feyned trifle. Forwhi in kinde of ymagis no difference the grauyng makith fro the &yogh;utting, or the &yogh;utting fro the grauyng, neither the peinting fro the grauyng; and also this seiyng lettith not what the lay partie is aboute forto lette in the clergie, that noon ymagis of God or of Seintis be in chirchis: and therfore this seiyng is to be cast aside as a iaperi.</P>
<P>Also iij<SUP>e</SUP>. Regum vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. it is writun, that Salomon made in the temple ij. ymagis of cherubyn of tree. Therfore open it is that thei were graued, and hem he couered and clothid al-aboute<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>alaboute</I>, MS.</NOTE> with plate of gold. And also he ordeyned the wallis of the temple to be graued with diuerse grauyngis, and he ordeyned to be graued ther yn ymagis of cherubyn and ymagis of palme trees and othere ymagis boocing and seem|yng as thou&yogh; thei were going and passing out of the wal. Also in the dooris of the temple he graued in a greet out-boocing<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>out boocing</I>, MS.</NOTE> ymagis of cherubyn and yma|gis of palme trees.

<P>And ferthermore, if to the peple of Israel it was leeful forto make and rere up an hi&yogh;e a brasen ymage of a serpent, forto biholde it; wondir it were but that it were leeful to Cristen men forto make and rere up an y&yogh;e an ymage of Crist crucified, forto biholde into it; and if it was leeful to the seid oold peple forto haue xij. ymagis of oxen bering vp the brasen see, forto biholde hem, wonder it were whi it schulde be vnleeful to Cristen peple forto haue xij. ymagis of the xij.

<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: It is writun in the Newe Testament, Matheu xxij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., whanne the Iewis askiden of Crist "whether it was leeful or no forto 
<PB REF="00000250.tif" N="140"> paie tribute to Cesar the Emperour of Rome," Crist answerid and seide, <I>Schewe &yogh;e to me the koyne of the money</I>, and thei offriden to him a denarie.

Thanne seid Crist: <I>&YOGH;elde &yogh;e therfore to the Emperour that that is his, and &yogh;elde &yogh;e to God what is Goddis</I>. Lo how Crist approued weel hem forto &yogh;elde to the Emperour the denarie, in which the ymage of the Emperour was graued; and alle men witen weel that thei my&yogh;ten not &yogh;elde to the Emperour such money so koyned, but if thei schulden haue and vse the ymage of the Emperour graued in thilk money. Wherfore nedis folewith that Crist approued weel hem forto haue and vce a graued ymage of the Emperour, as of her souereyn lord in erthe. An whi not thanne Crist schulde allowe and approue men forto haue and vse a grauen ymage of the Emperour in heuene, as of her Souereyn Lord in heuene?

<P>The iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal argument is this: If in sum other place of Holi Scripture than in the bifore alleg|gid text Exodi xx<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. and Deut. v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. it is founde that bi this word "graued thing" is signified no thing ellis than a graued God or a mawmet, certis no man mai cleyme and avowe and stonde bi vttirli, that in the bifore rehercid text Exodi xx<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. and Deut. v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. this word "graued thing" schulde needis bitokene a graued ymage dyuers fro a mawmet and fro a graued feyned God.

<P>Lo y rede Abacuk ij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. thus: <I>Lo, what profitith the graued thing, for his maker graued it; a wellid thing to gidere and a fals ymage, for the maker therof hopid in making, that he made doumbe symy|lacris?

Forwhi this word "graued thing" bitokeneth the thing into which men hopiden, and to which men spaken and seiden, <I>Rise thou</I>, and which men weeneden to haue be quyk; and therfore nedis "graued thing" in this place is take not for an ymage of God, but for an ymage pretendid to be God.

<P>THE ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: Doom of naturali weel disposid resoun weerneth not and re|proueth not ymagis to be had and to be vsid as rememoratijf and mynding signes. That this con|clusioun is trewe y proue thus: If eny doom of re|soun schulde weerne and reproue ymagis to be thus had and vsid, thilk doom of resoun schulde be oon of these iij. doomys, of whiche the firste is this: That peple doon ydolatrie bi and with tho ymagis. The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. is this: That the peple trowen or bileeuen summe wrong and vntrewe opiniouns bi occasioun of ymagis, as that sum godli vertu is in tho ymagis, or that tho ymagis doon myraclis, or that thei ben quyk and seen, heeren,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>and heere</I>, MS.

And therfore as for drede of ydolatrie, that is to seie, lest peple be ydolatreris in having and vsing ymagis, doom of resoun hath not forto weerne and reproue ymagis to be had and vsid.</P>
<P>The strengthe of this argument stondith vpon the very knowing what ydolatrie is.

<P>Also noman<NOTE PLACE="foot">The last three letters are written on an erasure in a later hand.

Wherfore Holi Scripture of the Newe Testament witnessith thus miche in this purpos, that forto haue and vse seable rememoratijf signes is leeful, expedient, and profitable; for ellis the sacramentis of Crist weren vnleeful, vnexpedient, and vnprofitable. And thanne her of ferther thus: If and whanne it is leeful and expe|dient forto haue and vse eny seable rememoratijf signes being lasse lijk to the thingis signified, it is leeful and expedient forto make, haue, and vse signes being more like to the same thingis signified. Forwhi the likenes of a signe to his significat, (that is to seie, to the thing signified bi him,) wole helpe the signe forto signifie and forto make remembraunce the bettir upon the thing signified; but so it is, that ymagis graued, coruun, or &yogh;ut ben more lijk to Crist and to his passioun, than ben the sacramentis whiche Crist ordeyned; thou&yogh; Crist hem ordeyned, (being so vnlike

Wherfore folewith, sithen bi Holi Scripture it is leeful and expedient for|to haue and vse the seable sacramentis, whiche Crist made as seable ymagis of Crist and of his passioun and deeth, it is ther yn impliedli bi Holi Scripture leeful and expedient for to haue seable ymagis graued, coruun, and &yogh;ut of Cristis persoon, figurid lijk to his persoon, with purtenauncis of his passioun and deeth, forto make us remembre upon him and his passioun and deeth. And in this wise mai be proued this pre|sent v<SUP>e</SUP>. conclusioun, that Holy Scripture wele<NOTE PLACE="foot">This word has been partly erased and retouched by a later (?) hand.

<P>The vj<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: Sufficient doom of weel disposid resoun allowith and approueth to haue and vse ymagis as rememoratijf signes in the maner after bifore seid. That this conclusioun is trewe y proue bi these folewing argumentis, of whiche the firste is this. Sufficient doom of resoun allowith and approueth us forto make and haue for us silf and for othere men ymagis of men and wommen, that tho men and wommen be therbi the oftir thou&yogh;t upon, and therfore be therbi the more loued and the better serued, and that the more be doon and suffrid of us and of othere biholders, for as miche as we bithenken

<P>Also thus: Whanne euer it is so, that we han in greet charge to performe and do eny dede or gouer|naunce, and we ben freel and redi to for&yogh;ete and to lete slippe out of mynde thilk deede or gouernaunce, it lijth in the doom of resoun ful weel that we take to us sum seable rememoratijf or mynding signes and tokenes forto therbi remembre us silf upon the deede or gouernaunce being to vs of so greet charge. For whi thus bi doom of resoun men doon anentis worldli deedis of charge, wher ynne lijth oonli worldli wynnyng or ascaping of worldli punysching; but so it is, that ech man hath in ful greet charge to loue God and drede God, that he mai therbi be hertid and strengthid in wil forto serue God; and he hath nede forto ofte thinke vpon tho thingis and meenis, whiche schulden stire him forto loue God and drede God, and forto haue wil to serue God and forto thenke vpon tho pointis in whiche he schulde serue to God.

Wherfore resoun wole weel iuge, allowe, and approue forto take, haue, and vse alle maners of suche deedis and thingis, whiche schulden remembre us myche upon the dignitees, benefetis, and punyschingis of God, and upon the pointis of his lawe. And among alle tho maners of thingis and deedis ben seable re|memoratijf thingis and deedis, as ben ymagis and the seid vsis of hem. Wherfore it folewith that doom of

<P>Confirmacioun herto is this: If a marchant or eny other man haue myche nede forto bithenke upon a certeine erand, it is weel allowid and approued in resoun that he take and vse sum seable rememoratijf signe and tokene forto mynde and remembre him upon the same erand; and it is weel allowid and approued bi resoun that he make a ring of a rische and putte it on his fynger, or that he write sum seable cros or mark<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I><ABBR EXPAN="mark">mk</ABBR></I>, MS.</NOTE> or carect with cole or chalk in the wal of his chaumbre or hal, or that he hange up bifore his si&yogh;t sum hood or girdil or staf or such other thing, or that he make a knot on his girdil or on his tipet, as alle men wolen herto consente. And if resoun schulde not as weel and as soone or miche more allowe and approue that a man make and vse seable rememoratijf signes (as ymagis and othere seable thingis or deedis,) into this eende, that he therbi the oftir thenke on Goddis worthinesse, Goddis benefetis, and hise punyschingis, and on vertues of hise lawis, ouermiche wondir it were.

<P>The vij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: It is leeful in properist maner of speking and taking leeful, (as it is take bifore in the ix<SUP>e</SUP>. reule or supposicioun sett bifore

<P>The viij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun schal be this: It is a point of Goddis moral lawe and of his plesaunt seruice for to haue and vse and sette up ymagis of God and of Seintis into vce of remembring therbi the better God, his passioun, and his othere benefetis, holi Seintis, and her holy lyues, and her suffringis.

<P>Also thus: Iudic. xvij<SUP>e</SUP>. and xviij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. is writun a long storie, how a womman vowid that of a summe

Aftir al this, the sones of Dan tooken awey bi strengthe these same ymagis and the seid preest which was bifore a deken oonli, and vsiden tho same ymagis, and ordeyneden that the same preest schulde office to God bifore tho ymagis in her tribu or kinred as he dide bifore in the hous of Miche.

<P>And as it was thanne there, that thilk riche and worthi man hadde in his hous such a chapel and such officiyng bifore ymagis of God, (which therfore

<P>THE secunde principal gouernaunce to be tretid in this present secunde partie, of which gouernaunce manye of the layfe ouer myche wijten the clergie, is this: That pilgrimagis to dyuerse bodies and bonys of Seintis be mad, and also ben mad to ymagis of Crist crucified and of Marie and of othere Seintis; and namelich for that pilgrimagis ben mad into summe placis more in which ben ymagis of the crucifix and of Marie and of Seintis, than into summe othere placis in whiche ben like ymagis of the crucifix and of Marie and of the same othere Seintis.
<PB REF="00000286.tif" N="176"></P>
<P>Into iustifiyng of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce y procede bi certein conclusiouns, of whiche the firste is this: Holi Scripture weerneth not and lettith not neither reproueth suche now seid pilgrymagis to be don. This conclusioun y proue thus: If eny place of Holy Scripture schulde so weerne, thilk place were this i<SUP>e</SUP>. Petri iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. where it is writun thus: <I>Moost dere britheren, nile &yogh;e go in pilgrimage in feruour which is maad to &yogh;ou to temptacioun:</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">This is Wiclif's rendering of the Vulgate, "Carissimi, nolite pe|regrinari in fervore, qui ad tenta|tionem vobis fit." Both here and elsewhere Pecock's citation agrees best with the later form of Wiclif's version. See Wycl. Bibl. vol. 4. p. 612.</NOTE> but so it is, that this now rehercid text of Scripture lettith not such bifore seid pilgrimage; and noon other place of Scripture is founde for to weerne suche seid pilgrimage. Wherfore noon place of Holy Scripture it weerneth, reproueth, or lettith.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of this argument mai be proued thus: The now rehercid proces of Petri (i<SUP>e</SUP>. Petri iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.) spekith not of pilgrimage which is a bodili going or a bodili remouyng fro oon place into an other, but he spekith of a variaunce and of a chaunging within|forth<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>with inforth</I>, MS., the hyphen at the end of the line being (acci|dentally?) omitted. It is distinctly written conjunctim just below.</NOTE> in mannis wil, bi which a man leueth and forsakith and passith withinforth fro that that he hath take upon him to kepe as lawe of God, and that for persecucioun which is don to him for the holding and keping of thilk lawe of God; which variaunce and awey going now seid Seint Peter clepith there pil|grimage bi a likenes to bodili pilgrimage and bi a figuratijf speche, which pilgrimage of the now seid variaunce he wolde that no Cristen man schude do. And this is al the meenyng of the now alleggid text. And if this be the meenyng ther of, certis he thanne 
<PB REF="00000287.tif" N="177"> lettith no thing bodili pilgrimage of which spekith the firste now bifore sett principal conclusion.</P>
<P>That this vnderstonding now bi me &yogh;ouun is the verry and dew litteral vndirstonding of the text i<SUP>e</SUP>. Petri iiij. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. it is open ynou&yogh; to alle hem, whiche wolen biholde al the hool proces fro thens into the eende of the chapiter. Forwhi euene immediatli at next to the now bifore alleggid text of Peter this proces folewith; <I>as if eny newe thing bifalle to &yogh;ou; but comune &yogh;e with the passiouns of Crist and haue &yogh;e ioie, that also &yogh;e be glad and haue ioie in the reuelacioun of his glorie. If &yogh;e ben dispisid for the name of Crist, &yogh;e schulen be blessid, forthat that is of the honour and of the glorie and of the vertu of God; and the Spirit that is his schal reste on &yogh;ou. But no man of &yogh;ou suffre as a mansleer, or a theef, or curser, or desirer of othere mennys goodis; but if as a Cristen man, schame he not; but glorifie he God in this name, et c&aelig;tera.</I> Lo hou open it is, (if these wordis of Peter be ioyned to the former wordis of Peter,) that Petir<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>that Petir</I> is interlineated by an early, but later hand.</NOTE> meeneth forto remove bi the for|mer wordis al vnstable vnconstaunce and variaunce and vnperseueraunce, which peple happili wolde haue in leuyng the lawe of God for persecucioun. Forwhi thoru&yogh; out al the wordis therto pertinentli ioyned and cleuyng Petir stireth tho same men for to haue pacience and perseueraunce in her persecucioun and abiding in the lawe of God, so that thei suffre thilk persecucioun for keping<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the keping</I>, MS. (first hand).</NOTE> of the lawe of God and not for her trespacis doon a&yogh;ens the lawe of God.</P>
<P>And therfore myn vndirstonding &yogh;ouun bifore to the former text of Petir is not feyned, but according to the hool al processe which Petir in the mater 
<PB REF="00000288.tif" N="178"> writith. And alle men musten<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>muste</I>, MS.

And so Austin knoulechid him silf hunte out the dew litteral vndirstonding of Holi Scripture.<NOTE PLACE="foot">It is not easy to say what pas|sage of Augustine Pecock may have had in view: the following remarks bear out, at all events, the assertion in the text. "Aut si et ipse (Adam sc.) figurate intelligendus est, quis genuit Cain et Abel et Seth? An et ipsi figurate tantum fuerunt, non etiam homines ex hominibus nati? De proximo ergo attendant istam pr&aelig;sumtionem quo tendat, et co|nentur nobiscum cuncta primitus qu&aelig; gesta narrantur in expres|sionem proprietatis accipere." S.

<P>Also thus: But if the seid vndirstonding were the trewe and dew litteral vndirstonding to the seid text, and if thilk text schulde weerne alle bodili pilgrimages, thanne thilk text were a&yogh;ens the doctrine of the Gospel and a&yogh;ens the doctrine of Crist.

<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: Doom of kindeli weel disposid resoun weerneth not and lettith not bodili pilgrymagis to be doon in the maner now bifore seid.

<P>The firste reule or supposicioun is this: The holi lijf and passioun of Iesus Crist was to alle Cristen a passing greet benefet: the &yogh;iftis of gracis, the glo|ries of heuen bihi&yogh;t ben to alle Cristene passyng greete benefetis: the holi lijf and conuersacioun of ech Seint is to alle Cristen a greet benefet of God &yogh;ouun to hem.

<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. reule or supposicioun is this: If God take upon him forto pointe and chese tho placis in whiche schulen be the noumbre of the seid ymagis in oon lond or cuntre, it is more according that we stonde to his pointing and chesing and assignyng, than that men bi her wittis oonli therto studie and devise forto make eny such pointing, chesing,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>or chesing</I>, MS.

<P>AFTIR al this what is tretid upon the firste and ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernauncis fro the bigynnyng of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti hidirto, (and that bi ix. conclusiouns seruyng to the firste gouernaunce, and bi othere ix. conclusiouns seruyng to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce,) y schal next now sette forth the argumentis and the obiecciouns, whiche the lay peple (being ouer myche wijters of the clergie) maken a&yogh;ens the seid firste and ij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernauncis.</P>
<P>Of whiche argumentis the firste is this: No cause can be assigned whi ymagis schulden be had and vsid and whi pilgrimagis schulden be doon saue this, that bi hem remembraunce and mynde schulde be maad vpon tho thingis whiche ben seid and rehercid bifore, (in the viij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie in the firste and ij<SUP>e</SUP>. reulis or supposicions,) that is to seie, the benefetis of God, his punyschingis, his holi lijf and passioun, the holi lyues of Seintis, and hi&yogh;e dig|nitees and worthinessis of God, and suche othere thingis, (certis if ymagis and pilgrimagis schulden not serue to suche now seid remembrauncis bi hem to be had, and folewingli to therbi the deuouter preiers to be had, ymagis and pilgrimagis weren in vein;) but so it is, that into suche now seid remembrauncis and myndingis to be gendrid and had, and folewingli therbi into ful deuout preiers to be had, mai and wole serue at ful<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>at the ful</I>, MS.

Wherfore the hauyng of ymagis and 
<PB REF="00000302.tif" N="192"> the doing of pilgrimagis mowe be weel forborn. And it is no nede that thei be.</P>
<P>Confirmacioun herof mai be this: Whanne euer eny thing is not good saue for a certein fruyt and good which schulde come therbi, thanne if thilk same fruyt and good mai be gete and had lijk wel or better bi an other meene than bi this thing, the hauing and vsing of this thing is not necessarie, (that is to seie, is not needisly to be had,) but mai ri&yogh;t weel be for|born. But so it is in this present purpos, that the hauing and vsing of ymagis and the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> doing of pil|grimagis ben idil and waastful, inlasse than thei be meenys into the seid remembrancis and preiers to be mad bi occasion of hem. And &yogh;it so it is, that therto writingis mowe serue better than thei. Wher|fore thei ben not necessarie, but thei mowe be ri&yogh;t weel lackid and not had and doon.</P>
<P>And if eny man wole be aboute forto answere herto and seie, that not alle men and wommen mowe come into this, that thei schulen kunne rede writingis in bokis; and therfore for suche vnlettrid men and wommen ymagis musten be had as bokis to hem, and of hem pilgrimagis musten be doon, and ellis the seid remembrauncis my&yogh;te not of hem be had: thanne the seid arguers wolen sette to and for|tofie her partie thus: It my&yogh;te be ordeyned that alle men and wommen in her &yogh;ongthe schulden leerne forto rede writingis in the langage in which thei schulden lyue and dwelle; and thanne therbi schulde come forth not oonli this seid good of remembrauncing, but myche othir good also ther with. And therfore thei setten litil bi the answere now maad.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: If bischopis, preestis, and clerkis foundun and endewid therto bi the lay 
<PB REF="00000303.tif" N="193"> peple wolden preche to the lay peple so ofte and so myche as thei ou&yogh;ten do bi her office, the seid thingis whiche mowe be remembrid to the lay peple bi ymagis and bi pilgrimagis, the lay peple schulde be so sufficientli remembrid upon tho thingis, that thei schulden haue no neede neither profit at al for to haue and vse ymagis, or<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>or</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> forto make pilgrimagis into the seid remembrauncis to be therbi gete and had. Wherfore it is not resonable neithir conueni|ent that the necligence of so weel wagid bischopis, preestis, and clerkis schulde be suffrid to be and con|tynue; and that the lay peple schulde be dryue bi thilk necligence of prelatis and preestis into cost and labour, and into purchasing to hem of new meenis into the same eende into whiche the diligence of preestis and clerkis bi hem costioseli founde schulde serue and strecche.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: Vein and waastful occu|pacioun it is forto make myche labour and cost forto haue and vse the sympler and vnperfiter and lasse representing ymage of a thing, whanne with lasse labour and cost mai be had the perfiter and fuller and better representing ymage of the same thing. But so it is, that ech lyuyng man is verier and per|fiter and fuller and better representing ymage of Crist and of ech Seint, than is eny vnquyk stok or stoon graued and ourned with gold and othere gay peinturis.<NOTE PLACE="foot">See <I>The Apology for the Lol|lards</I>, ascribed to Wiclif, p. 88.</NOTE> Wherfore it is vein and waast forto make such labour and cost into the making and hauyng of suche vnquyke gay ymagis.</P>
<P>The iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: God is lijk presentli euery where, and therfore he is lijk redi for to &yogh;eue hise gracis and &yogh;iftis euery where, where euer a man 
<PB REF="00000304.tif" N="194"> sechith after hem; and therfore no place in erthe is holier than an other<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>other</I>, MS.

Wherfore it is vein waast and idil forto trotte to Wasingam rather than to ech other place in which an ymage of Marie is, and to the rode of the north dore at London rather than to ech other roode in what euer place he be.</P>
<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: The feendis wijlis and deceitis ben forto be waarli considerid and forto be smertli fled, as Peter techith, (i<SUP>e</SUP>. Petri v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. in the eende): but so it is that the feend hath deceyued sli&yogh;li and wijlily men and wommen whiche han wor|schipid ymagis and han come to ymagis in pilgrimage, as it<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>it</I> is added by a later hand.</NOTE> is open ynou&yogh; in the lijf and legend of Seint Bartholome,<NOTE PLACE="foot">The legend (both in its Greek and Latin form) may be seen in Tischendorf's <I>Act.

<P>The ix<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is this: Iohun iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., whanne Crist saat at the welle of Iacob and talkid with the womman Samaritan, he excludid the vce of ymagis and the vce of pilgrimage.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>pilgrimagis</I>, MS.

Thus myche Crist seide there: wherbi is excludid and wilned of Crist to be removed, that eny man schulde worschipe God bi eny outward ymagis; in as miche as he wolde ech man aftir him comyng forto be so perfit that he wor|schipe God in spirit and in trouthe of Goddis being, and not in an ymage feyned to be in Goddis stide. Also Crist in the same chapiter, speking with the same womman removed pilgrimagis. Forwhi whanne the womman had seid to him thus: <I>I se that thou art a prophet.

<PB REF="00000307.tif" N="197"> (that is to seie, Iewis,) <I>worschipen what we knowen: for helthe is of the Iewis.</I> Thus miche there. Of which proces folewith that Crist excludid pilgrimage, whanne he seid that peple schulde frothens after wor|schipe neither in Ierusalem neither in the now seid hil; for the worschiping, which the peple made in tho ij. placis, was bi pilgrimage going into tho placis.

<P>Another confirmacioun into this same purpos is this: In Londoun sumtyme was a bischop whos name was Gravyseende,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Stephen Gravesend was Bishop of London from A.D. 1319-1338.</NOTE> and which lijth now buried in the chirche of Seint Poul at London in the plein pament of the chirche weel binethe the myddis of the chirche.

<P>FOR answere to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument it is to wite that bischopis and othere preestis and clerkis ben not bounde more or ferther for to preche or in other wise teche her peple vndir hem, than that therwith tho same bischopis and othere clerkis attende to hem silf

<P>Answere to the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument schal be this: The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument in which it is seid thus, "that ech Cristen man is a perfiter and a fuller and a spedier ymage of Crist than is eny stok or stoon graued," is vntrewe; and therfore the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. ar|gument bildid ther upon lackith strengthe for to proue his entent. That this now rehercid ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse is vntrewe, y schewe thus: Thre condiciouns muste be had in a thing, that he be a perfit and a ful and a spedy ymage or representer or remembrer of another thing bi wey of ymage being of the same other thing.</P>
<P>Oon condicioun is, that he be lijk myche or sum|what to the othir thing, and the more lijk he be to

<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. condicioun is, that he be deputid or assigned forto represente and bringe into mynde the other thing. This condicioun dooth ful myche that a thing be ymage of an other thing. Forwhi whanne a thing is ful litil lijk to another thing, as the visible eukarist to the persoon of Crist, and the water of baptim to the sepulcre of Crist; &yogh;it the deputacioun and the assignyng bi which the visible eukarist is ordeyned and assigned forto represente the bodi of Crist and forto remembre vs upon the persoon of Crist and hise benefetis, (as it is open Luk xxij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. and i<SUP>e</SUP>.

<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. condicioun is, that the thing so deputid forto represente to us the othir thing, haue not (at leest for thilk while) eny plites or officis or deputaciouns or disposiciouns, wherbi we muste haue manye<NOTE PLACE="foot">Written on an erasure.

<P>Now, Sir, herbi it is open that no thing is so verrili an ymage of an other thing if he haue not these iij. condiciouns, as he schulde be if he haue these iij. now seid condiciouns. And thanne ferther thus: But so it is, that no Cristen man now lyuyng hath these iij. condicions anentis the persoon of Crist in his manhode, as hath a stok or a stoon graued into the likenes of Crist hanging on a cros nakid and woundid, with othere therto purtenauncis, (as it is open ynou&yogh; to euery man therto weel biholding and assaiyng thoru&yogh; alle these iij. condiciouns to gidere;) except whanne a quyk man is sett in a pley to be hangid nakid on a cros and to be in semyng woundid and scourgid. And this bifallith ful seelde and in fewe placis and cuntrees. Wherfore no man lyuyng and walking in erthe and occupiyng him silf and occupied of othere men, as othere men lyuen and walken and occupien and ben occupied, is so perfit and so ful an ymage of Crist crucified or of Crist doing this miracle or that myracle, as graued stok or stoon therto schapun is. And her bi it is open that the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument hath no quyk foot for to go. Fy! fy! fy! therfore vpon presumpcioun and obstynacie in the lay party, of whiche y herde summe seie with a strong herte, (as thou&yogh; he hadde be ful of kunnyng, whanne he was therof ful empti,) that a greet heresie it is for to 
<PB REF="00000332.tif" N="222"> holde that a stok or a stoon graued is a fuller and a perfiter ymage of Crist than is a Cristen man.

<P>THE iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument leeneth here to, that bi cause God is lijk weel in his substaunce and being euery where, ther fore God schulde be lijk redi forto &yogh;eue his gracis to askers and sechers euerywhere; and that also therfore no place in erthe is holier than an other place, and noon ymage of a thing is holier than an other ymage of the same thing. But certis al this is vntrewe and to be denyed. And cause whi God wole &yogh;eue hise gracis rather in oon place to sechers aftir hise gracis than in an other place, is this: God chesith therto, that is to seie, forto &yogh;eue hise gracis oon place bifore an other place, as it is bifore proued in the viij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter of this present ij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie. And if this be trewe, certis therof folewith that bi cause God chesith oon place bifore an other forto therinne wirche holi deedis of myraclis and of gracis more than in an othir<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>a othir,</I> MS.</NOTE> place, therfore the oon place is holier than the other place is.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>is</I> is interlineated by a later(?) hand.</NOTE> And if this be trewe, certis so bi lijk skile, bicause that God chesith oon ymage bifore an other forto wirche bi it or bifore it miraclis and gracis more than bi an other ymage or more than bifore another ymage, therfore it is ri&yogh;tli to be seid that oon ymage of Marie is holier than an other ymage of Marie is, and oon ymage of a crucifix is holier than an other ymage of 
<PB REF="00000333.tif" N="223"> the same crucifix is. And that God chesith (so as now is seid) oon place bifore an other and oon ymage bifore an other, it is vndoutabili schewid and proued bifore in the place now alleggid, that is to seie, in the viij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie and in therof the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>., v<SUP>e</SUP>., and vj<SUP>e</SUP>. reulis or supposiciouns, whiche wolden be rehercid to ech man which wole obiecte bi the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument. And herbi the strengthe of the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument is leid aside.</P>
<P>The conceit of the comoun peple which thei hadden, that no place is holier than an other place is, and in lijk maner that noon ymage is holier than an othir ymage is, and that God chesith not more oon place than an othir, neither oon ymage more than an othir, forto helpe mannis needis the rather, hath be a ful greet lett to the comoun peple<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>peple</I> is added by a later hand.</NOTE> forto allowe the hauyng and the vce of ymagis and the doing of pil|grimagis. But now sithen this conceit is vndoutabili schewid to be vntrewe, it is to hope that (as bi eny strengthe of the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument) thei schulen no lenger so erre, aftir this answere schal be cleerli opened to hem.</P>
<P>For the more cleering of this present answere, it is to wite that a thing is holi in three maners. In oon maner (which is propir maner of speking) a thing is holi, for that it doith good moral deedis; and in this maner God is holi, and aungel is holi, and mannys soul and man is holi, if and whanne he doith eny good moral deedis. And in this maner of holines no thing is holi saue it which worchith holili, that is to seie, which wirchith bi fre choise what resoun deemeth to be doon for God: and that is to wirche morali weel. And so in this maner no place is holi, neither eny ymage is holi, neither eny other thing than which 
<PB REF="00000334.tif" N="224"> hath fre wil to do moral yuel and good in the maner now seid. Of this maner of holynes spekith Holi Writt in manye placis, as Leuitic. v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.<NOTE PLACE="end">Probably Levit. xx.8 is the place intended.</NOTE> where God seith thus: <I>I am holi, which make &yogh;ou holi.</I> Also Leuit. the xj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. God seide: <I>Be &yogh;e holi, for y am holi.</I> Also Exodi xxij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. God seide thus: <I>&YOGH;e schulen be holi men to me.</I></P>
<P>In an other maner a thing is holi, for it is chosun that in it or bi it or with it or bifore it a persoon wirche such seid holi deedis; and that whethir the wircher be God, aungel, or man: for skile is ther noon that a man bi suche gode deedis schulde make a place to be holi, but that God and aungel bi her moraly vertuose wirching of miraclis schulde in lijk maner make a place to be holi. And in this maner oon place is holier than an other place is, and oon ymage is holier than an other ymage is, bi cause in oon place more grace and more other benefet into mannis profite is doon than in an other place, and bi oon ymage more grace and more other benefet into mannis profit is &yogh;ouun than bi an othir ymage or than bifore<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>bi,</I> MS. (first hand).</NOTE> an other ymage; and therto God chesith the place and the ymage. Wherto ful weel accordith Holi Scripture, Genes. xxviij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., where it is seid, that whanne Iacob wente forto seche to him a wijf, he came after the sunnys going doun into a place in which he leide him doun forto there slepe and reste in the ny&yogh;t folewing; and he in thilk reste hadde suche visiouns maad to him bi God, as it is seid there, that whanne he woke he seide these wordis: <I>Sotheli the Lord is in this place and y knewe not! And he dreding seide: Hou gastful is this place! here is noon other thing no but the hous of God, and the &yogh;ate of heuen!</I>
<PB REF="00000335.tif" N="225"></P>
<P>Also Exodi iij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., whanne Moyses kepte the schep of Ietro preest of Madian, he came with his scheep to the Mount of Oreb. <I>And God apperid to him in the flamme of fier fro the myddis of a busch, and he si&yogh; that the busch brent, and &yogh;it was not therbi waastid. Therfore Moises seide: I schal go and y schal se this greet si&yogh;t, whi the busch is not wastid. Sotheli the Lord sie that Moyses &yogh;ede to se, and he clepid Moyses fro the myddis of the busch, and seide: Nei&yogh;e thou not hidir, but vndo the scho of thi feet; for the place in which thou stondist is holi lond, et c&aelig;tera.</I> Certis no man may seie that this holines of place came yn bi sum cerimonie of Iewis lawe, for euereither of these stories were doon eer eny lawe was &yogh;ouun to the Iewis: and therfore this holynes of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner was neuere reuokid bi Cristis passioun.</P>
<P>In the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner a thing is holi, (thou&yogh; also in an vnpropir maner, in reward of the first maner;) whanne<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>whanne euere,</I> MS.

In this maner Seint Dionyse, the disciple of Seint Poul, in his book <I>Of the Chirchis Ierarchie</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">"<GAP DESC="Greek">." Dionys. Areop. <I>de Eccl. Hierarch.</I> c. 2. (Op. tom. 1. p. 255. Ed. Cord.)

And this is ynou&yogh; for answere to the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument.</P>
<P>That the v<SUP>e</SUP>. argument goith not forth y schewe thus: If the v<SUP>e</SUP>. argument were good, thanne this argument were good. The feendis wilis and hise deceitis ben fer awey to be fled; but so it is, that it hath ofte be knowun that feendis han spoke in men and wommen, as witness herof is had in the Gospelis in dyuerse placis, and Acts xvj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. of a &yogh;ong womman, which gate myche money to her maistris bi answeris which the feend &yogh;aue and spake in hir and bi hir.

Wherfore no man speke or entermete or haue to do with eny other man or womman, or bileeue and truste to eny man or womman; bi cause that it is founde that the feend hath spoke bi men and wom|men, euen as he hath spoke bi ymagis. Certis this argument is lijk to the v<SUP>e</SUP>. argument, as ech man mai soone se; and this argument is nau&yogh;t and hath no strengthe. Wherfore neither the v<SUP>e</SUP>. argument hath strengthe.</P>
<P>This therfore is the consideracioun and the obser|uaunce, awaite, and diligence which is to be had in such mater. It is diligentli to be awaitid whether the feend entermetith him with eny thing, (as ymage

Therfore the first proces, which the ix<SUP>e</SUP>. argument alleggith, Iohun iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., lettith no thing the hauyng and the vsing bifore seid of ymagis.</P>
<P>Ferthermore, that the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. processe of Iohun iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. alleggid in the ix<SUP>e</SUP>. argument lettith not pilgrimage to be doon, y proue thus: The wordis therto allegged ben these: <I>Womman, bileue thou to me for the hour schal come, whanne neither in this hil,</I> (that is to seie, of Garizim,) <I>neither in Ierusalem &yogh;e schulen worschipe the Fadir, et c&aelig;tera.</I> Thanne thus: Bi these wordis can not be more or other had, than that Crist prophecied the seid hil and Ierusalem to be distruyed; and so myche to be distroied, that ther schulde not be eny preier mad or eny pilgrimage maad in the seid hil or in the temple of Ierusalem. And this distruc|cioun was maad bi Vaspacian and Tite, Emperouris of Rome, the xlij<SUP>e</SUP>. &yogh;eer aftir Cristis passion; but open it is, that herof may not be take that Crist therbi schulde seie or teche pilgrimage to be vnleeful, no more than if he had seid, that the hour schal come in 
<PB REF="00000345.tif" N="235"> which neither in thilk hil neither in Ierusalem schal eny preching of Goddis lawe be, schulde folewe that therbi Crist schulde teche preching of Goddis lawe to be vnleeful. Wherfore open it is, that of the seid and alleggid ij<SUP>e</SUP>. processe of Ioon the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. in the ix<SUP>e</SUP>, argument can not be had in eny wise, that Crist schulde therbi reproue pilgrimagis, that thei be not leefulli to be doon. And this is ynou&yogh; for answere to the ix<SUP>e</SUP>. argument.</P>
<P>For answere to the x<SUP>e</SUP>. argument it is to wite, that vndir thre ententis and purposis a man mai go in pilgrimage; and ech of tho iij. ententis is leeful, honest, and expedient. The firste is forto be quykli and deuoutli remembrid in the place of pilgrimage upon Goddis worthinessis, hise benefetis, and punysch|ingis, his holi lijf and passioun, or upon summe Seintis holi conuersacioun, or forto haue quietnes and sool|nes to preie to God or to a Seint; and al this forto do there, bi cause that bothe he schal be there fer fro his owne hous, (and therfore fer fro thou&yogh;tis whiche wolde come into him, if he were in his owne hous and with his owne meyne,) and also for that God hath chose thilk place in which he wole do and wirche and &yogh;eue singulerli bifore that he wole do &yogh;eue and wirche in manie othere placis; as it is bifore schewid, that he wole in summe placis bifore othere placis so do. And if a man go in pilgrimage to a place for this entent oonli, which is for his owne edi|ficacioun oonli, he mai go priueli thider as weel as openli, and aboute mydny&yogh;t as wel as about myddai; for he entendith not to ensaumple his deede of vertu to eny othir persoon.</P>
<P>But ferthermore, for as miche as we han teching of Crist, Mat. v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., that we mowe leefulli and merytorili do oure vertuose deedis openli bifore othere men, vndir this entent that thei be moued forto do in lijk maner vertuoseli, therfore vndir an other entent, which 
<PB REF="00000346.tif" N="236"> is the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. entent, a man mai vertuoseli, honestli, and expedientli go in pilgrimage in such maner that ther|bi he ensaumple his dede of pilgrimage to be folewid of othere men, that thei go in pilgrimage thanne or in sum other leiser which thei wolen<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>wole,</I> MS. (first hand).</NOTE> to hem silf point forto edifie hem silf, as he goith thidir for to edifie him silf. And open ynow it is, that who euer wole go in pilgrimage vnder this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. entent, he muste do it openli and not priueli; and ellis he failith in his pil|grimage. Forwhi ellis his deede answerith not to his entent, as it is open ynou&yogh;.</P>
<P>In the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner a man mai go in pilgrimage vndir entent forto supporte and menteyne that the mynde of the Seint and the mynde of his lyuyng and the mynde of the benefet, which God hath &yogh;ouun to us, bi that thilk Seint lyued so weel; or ellis for|to supporte and menteyne the mynde herof, that God hath chose thilk place and thilk memorial, (whether it be an ymage or a relik,) that thilk mynde die not and falle not into for&yogh;eting. For thou&yogh; it be suffi|cientli in Goddis power forto menteyne the fame of thilk place and of the ymage and of the seid chesing and of her holynes, &yogh;it men ou&yogh;ten do her part bi kindenes and gentilnes for to bi her power menteyne the same, and that bi word and bi deede of haunting and comyng thidir. And this supporting and meyn|tenaunce of this fame of the place of the ymage and of the Seint and of the seid chesing, which God hath maad there to be doon bi pilgrimage, cannot be do anentis othere folk, but if the pilgrimage be don openli, as it is open ynou&yogh; to ech mannys resoun.</P>
<P>And sithen it is<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>is</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> openli schewid that a man may leefully and expedientli and honestli do a pilgrimage, not oonli in the firste maner but also in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>.

<P>FOR answere to the xij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument y graunte the i<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of the argument, and y denye the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. pre|mysse of it; which ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse is this: That bothe Iewis and hethen men worschipiden ymagis for Goddis, whiche thei wisten be<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>ben,</I> MS.

For that this is vntrewe y schal schewe bi witnessing of Holi Scripture, and bi witnessing of him which was an ydolatrer and a greet clerk among hethen men, (whos name is Hermes Tris|megistus,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>Trimegistus,</I> MS., and so also below.</NOTE>) and also bi doom of resoun. First, bi tes|timonye of Holi Scripture thus. It is writun in the lxxxxv<SUP>e</SUP>. Psalme thus: <I>Alle goddis of hethen men ben feendis, forsothe God made heuenes.</I> But so it is, that noon ymagis maad bi mennys hondis ben feendis or weren euere feendis. Wherfore no Goddis of hethen men ben or weren oonli ymagis mad bi mennys hondis. Certis this argument is so formal a sillogisme that no man may denye his forme in proceding: and the firste premysse is witnessid pleinli bi Holi Scripture in lxxxxv<SUP>e</SUP>.

<P>Also Hermes Trismegistus in his book, (as Austyn rehercid, [Lib.] viij. <I>De Civ.

And no man couthe &yogh;eue to us surer and sikerer and trewer instruccioun how ydolatrers diden, than he which was an ydolatrer in him silf, and was a greet clerk among hem, and was a greet defender of ydolatrie bi hise writingis.</P>

<P>What thanne was the hool thing which thei wor|schipiden for eny God, good it were forto here leerne and knowe. And forto here the treuthe herof this muste be seid in this mater. Soone aftir the bigyn|nyng of the world, bisidis hem that lyueden in doom of resoun and therwith recuyueden bileeue fro God and aungelis, summe othere and manye lyueden in doom of resoun oonli and receyueden not such now seid bileeue delyuered to the world bi God and bi aungelis.

And ferthermore, for as myche as these men aspieden weel bi greet witt, that the seid parties of heuen reuliden ful myche the worchingis of bodies here binethe in the lou&yogh;er world, and thei couthen not come ferther forto wite what was doon in eny bodi here binethe which deede was not reulid bi hem aboue, therfore thei helden and trowiden that the bodili heuen and hise seid parties reuliden al that was reuleable here bynethe among men and among othere bodies and thingis; and folew|ingli herof thei helden and trowiden that heuen and

And thanne ferther, sithen him thou&yogh;te in his resoun that forto cleue to a thing as to his Souereyn Lord, whom he wolde worschipe, loue, and serue, and &yogh;it for to haue noon homelynes with the same thing were an vnchereful thing to the same man, and it were damageful to the Lord so chosun, (in as myche as in this straungenes the lasse worschip and the lasse loue and seruice this man schulde do to him,) and her with al him thou&yogh;te that thilk Lord was resonable, was curteis, was gentil, and louyng, and also wijs forto consente into a purpos strecching in to his more worschiping and seruyng; therfore thilk man deemed in his resoun that if he wolde make an honest, fair, riche, and preciose ymage vndir this entent, that oon such seid hi&yogh; spirit schulde vouche saaf forto ali&yogh;te and descende into it, thilk spirit wolde al redi conforme him to the seid entent of the man. And ferthermore, sithen men knewen weel the power of spiritis to be ful grete and to be gretter than men my&yogh;ten comprehende, men trowiden that tho spiritis wolden so ioyne hem silf with tho 
<PB REF="00000355.tif" N="245"> ymagis in so curiose and hi&yogh;e and incomprehensible maner aboue mannys witt, that of the spirit and of the ymage to gidere in an vndeclarable maner schulde be maad a sensible God; sumwhat lijk to the maner in which we Cristen men bileeuen that God descen|did into mankinde and couplid so to him a singuler mankinde, that he which was bifore pure God invisi|bili was aftirward sensible visibil man, and wolde so be and lyue among men for loue which he hadde to men and for nede which men hadden therto. And her upon men maden suche seid ymagis and assaieden forto stire and prouoke suche seid spiritis forto de|scende and come into tho maad ymagis, and where and whanne thei weeneden and trowiden gode spiritis forto haue come into tho ymagis, badde spiritis en|triden into tho ymagis; and bi certein whilis wolden moue and speke and wirche sensibili in tho ymagis, and bi manye othere whilis thei wolden<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>wolde,</I> MS.

And so, forto come into the point for which y write this processe, these hethen men worschipiden not the pure ymage in it silf as for her God, (no more than Cristen men worschipen now the singuler&middot; manhede of Crist as for Crist and as for God,) and &yogh;it the hethen men helden her God to be bodili and bodied in a maner which thei couthen not at fulle vndirstonde, euen as we Cristen men holden now oure God to be bodili and to be bodied in a maner which no Cristen man kan at the ful com|prehende and vndirstonde. And as it is trewe that Cristen men worschipen a man and a born man in this world for her God, but thei worschipen not so 
<PB REF="00000356.tif" N="246"> the pure manhode in him silf with oute more therto sett; so the hethen men worschipiden an ymage and a bodili graued thing for her God, but not the pure bodili graued ymage in him silf with oute more for her God. And so these ij. thingis whiche Scripture seith of ydolatrers stonden to gidere and ben trewe: <I>that alle Goddis of hethen men ben feendis;</I> and also in the cxxxiiij<SUP>e</SUP>.

Thus miche is ynou&yogh;, as for now and here, forto knowe how ydolatrie came vp.</P>
<P>And that this conceit of ydolatrie is not feyned, it is open. Forwhi ellis Holi Scripture herto bifore alleggid mai not conuenientli and likely be saued, nei|ther the testimonye of Hermes mai ellis weel stonde, neither resoun mai consent how ydolatrie in so wise persoones schulde in other wise bigynne and be doon. Ferthermore, for as myche as the seide hethen men trowiden the seid ymagis to haue be quyke continueli with the seid spiritis whom thei trowiden to haue be Goddis, therfore tho hethen men trowiden tho ymagis to haue alwey herd what men spaken to hem and haue seen what was doon to hem; thou&yogh; for hi&yogh; dig|nite thei wolden not at alle tymes &yogh;eue answeris, nei|ther at alle tymes schewe that thei herden and sawen and my&yogh;ten move hem silf, into tyme thei weren myche preied and weel serued and plesid of men.

<P>FORTO make bi al this proces an answere to the xij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument it is to be seid thus: The hethen men, of which it is now seid that thei worschipiden ymagis for her Goddis, diden so and camen into thilk greet synne of ydolatrie, bi cause thei neuer receyueden the feith which othere men (not being ydolatrers) in tho same daies receyueden: but tho hethen men trustiden as into al her reule to the doom of resoun, and wolden not seche aftir forto attende to the euydencis whiche thei my&yogh;ten bi doom of re|soun 
<PB REF="00000358.tif" N="248"> haue had for the feith, which othere men in tho daies hadden and to whiche thei attendiden. And therfore the principal clerkis and grettist and wor|thiest reulers of tho hethen men fillen into idolatrie bi the now discriued and tau&yogh;t maner, and the sympler partie of hem folewiden the worthier and the more wijs partie, as hem thou&yogh;te it was conuenient forto do; and thus al the greet multitude fil into ydolatrie and continueden therin.</P>
<P>Manye also of the Iewis, whiche weren<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>were,</I> MS.

And therfore and therbi manie of the Iewis at dyuerse tymes fillen into ydolatrie and continueden therinne.</P>
<P>But now sumwhat bifore the birthe of Crist alle Iewis camen into so greet attendaunce to the euydencis of verry feith teching oon God to be, and also aftir the passioun of Crist hider to in this<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>inthis,</I> MS.</NOTE> present day so gret doom of resoun hath be founde bothe of hethen men and of Iewis and of Cristen men, and herwith also so grete evidencis of the feith teching oon God to be aloon ben hadde in so greet haunt and vce and in so long confermed continuaunce, that a this side the passioun of Crist was not into this present dai eny ydolatrie among Iewis neither among hethen men, whiche lyuen in eny notable famose sect; or, if among hethen men be eny ydolatrie, it is in ful fewe placis among wrecchid persoones not sett bi of othere hethen men. And sithen al this is trewe, (as 
<PB REF="00000359.tif" N="249"> ech wijs man can it recorde to be trewe,) herof it muste nedis folewe that now adaies it is not perel to Cristen men neithir to the Iewis neither to hethen men forto haue and entermete with ymagis of God, as it was in the daies fer bifore going the incarna|cioun of Crist. And the cause herof is now next bifore seid, that the knowing of oon verri God is more substanciali and more sureli and confermedli had now than it was bifore in tho eeldist daies. Neither it is to be drad that eny Cristen men ben priueli ydolatrers bi occasioun of ymagis. And the cause is now bifore seid, which [is] that the feith of oon God is so weel attendid to and so weel confer|med, and doom of resoun longing therto is so miche hi&yogh;ed aboue that it was in eeldist daies, that noon such drede is to be had now of ydolatrie as was longe bifore in eeldist daies to be drad.

<P>If eny man wole obiecte a&yogh;ens my conceit now bifore sett vpon the bigynnyng and cause of idolatrie, and wole allegge a&yogh;ens me what is writen in Sa|pience xiiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. of the bigynnyng and the cause of ydolatrie thus: <I>Forsothe idolis weren</I><NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>were,</I> MS.

Aftirward in the tyme comyng bitwixe, whanne the wickid custom was strong, this errour was kept as a lawe, and ymagis

<P>The vij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule or supposicioun myche lijk to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is this: Whanne a man doith or suffrith a deede bi eny thing which is a meene prouoking or stiring notabili the doer or suffrer for to it do or suffre, or which is in eny other wise a notable meene therto, it is woned be seid that thilk meene dooth the deede; in this vnderstonding, that thilk meene helpith and fortherith in meenyng that the deede be don of his veri doer: as, if Iohun be a prouoking meene that the King &yogh;eue<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>&yogh;eueth,</I> MS.

<PB REF="00000374.tif" N="264"> that the same &yogh;euyng be doon. This reule is open bi experience. Also in Holi Writt the colour of this present vij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is ensaumplid and vsid. Forwhi, Iames the v<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter, it is seid thus: <I>If eny of &yogh;ou is sijk, lede he in preestis of the chirche, and preie thei for him, and anointe thei in the name of the Lord: and the preier of feith schal saue the sijk man.</I> Lo how Holi Writt seith that the preier schal saue the sijk man, not withstonding that in very trouthe of propre speche neither the preier neither he that preieth dooth thilk deede of sauyng, but God aloone doith<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>doith</I> is interlineated in a later (?) hand.</NOTE> thilk deede of sauyng; and the preier wirchith oonli as a meene in prouoking ther to, and the man preiying wirchith also oonli as a meene pro|uoking in to the saaf sauyng. Thus it is open that the vij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is witnessid bi Holi Scripture to be trewe.</P>
<P>And if this reule be trewe, certis thanne folewith ther of that the viij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule or supposicioun is trewe, which is this: It is allowable that y seie thus: "I preie Iohun forto &yogh;eue to me the seid fee;" and it is allowable that y seie thus: "I preie the seid preier of Iohun to be maad to the King, that thilk preier &yogh;eue to me the same fee of xx<SUP>ti</SUP>. pound." For whi, if this speche is alloweable: "Iohun &yogh;euyth<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>&yogh;euyth</I> and <I>&yogh;euith</I> (as well as <I>prouid</I> below) are not forms used in the body of the MS.: they occur in the midst of words written on erasures, which are very extensive throughout this paragraph, two|thirds of which have been re-written in a very similar style, but not by the same hand as the rest.

And that the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse is trewe, it may be prouid thus: To this speche, "Iohun &yogh;eueth to me this seid fee "of xx<SUP>ti</SUP>. pound," and to this speche, "His preier &yogh;eueth to me the same xx<SUP>ti</SUP>. pound," the dewe vn|dirstondingis ben these: "Iohun is meene that the seied fee be &yogh;ouun to me, and his preier is also meene that the same seid fee is &yogh;ouun to me," as schewith the vij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule. And open it is bi the v<SUP>e</SUP>. rewle that this vndirstonding is allowable and con|venient ynou&yogh;. Wherfore the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse is trewe. And so nedis the conclusioun of the bothe premyssis is trewe, namelich sithen in lijk maner lijk verrili the dewe vndirstonding of this speche: "Y preie Iohun that he &yogh;eue to me the seid fee, and y preie his preier forto &yogh;eue to me the same fee," is this: "I preie Iohun that he be meene into the &yogh;euyng of the seid fee, and y preie Iohun that he make the preier of him to be also meene into the same &yogh;euing of the same fee," as it is open bi the vj<SUP>e</SUP>. and bi the vij<SUP>e</SUP>. reulis. And this vndirstonding is allowable and conuenient ynou&yogh;. Wherfore nedis folewith that the seid conclusioun is trewe.</P>

<P>FOR answere to the xiiij<SUP>e</SUP>. and xv<SUP>e</SUP>. argumentis to gidere vndir oon, y sende bifore these iij. reulis or supposicions.</P>
<P>Oon is: That a man schal haue more feruentli hise affecciouns and loues anentis his loued freend, whanne and whilis thilk freend is at sumwhile present per|sonali with him and bisidis him, than he schal haue, if the freend be absent alwey and not personali pre|sent with him. This reule is openli trewe bi expe|rience. Forwhi, (not withstonding a man talke and speke of his freend at the mete table or in sum other place, and haue as good affeccioun as he can haue upon the same freend in such absence,) &yogh;it if in the meene while the freend come into him personali and sitte doun with him, he schal haue miche gretter af|feccioun vpon the seid freend than he hadde in the freendis absence. Wherfore this firste reule is trewe.
<PB REF="00000378.tif" N="268"></P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is this: If a man wole encrese his gode affecciouns anentis his absent freend, whilis he mai not haue the same freend visibili present, it is profitable to him that he ymagine thilk freend to be with him present bodili. This is euydentli trewe bi assay of experience to alle hem whiche &yogh;euen hem wijsly to the bisynes of contemplacioun, namelich in the bigynnyng of her contemplatijf lijf. Wherfore this reule is trewe.</P>
<P>Also thus: If the freend were bodili visibili pre|sent, thilk presence were best forto gendre the seid affeccioun. Wherfore the other next present being of his freend, which is next aftir his bodili present visible being, is the next grettist meene aftir his bodili visible presence into the gendring of the seid affeccioun. And thanne ferther thus: But so it is, that thilk present beyng of the freend, grettist aftir his bodili visible presence, is his presence in ymagi|nacioun. Wherfore this present ij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is trewe: That it is ful profitable into gendring of affecciouns upon the absent freend, that the desirer of the affec|cioun haue ymaginacioun that thilk freend is in<NOTE PLACE="foot">The preposition <I>in</I> (occurring at the end of the line in the MS.) is joined by a hyphen to its sub|stantive, thus showing that in|stances of apparent junction of prepositions to their substantives are not purely accidental.</NOTE> bodili maner present.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. reule is this: It is esier forto ymagyne a thing absent to be present in an other thing lijk therto, than withoute eny other thing lijk therto. Forwhi euery thing lijk to an othir thing bringith into ymaginacioun and into mynde better and li&yogh;tir and esier the thing to him lijk, than the thing to him lasse lijk or vnlijk. And herfore it is that miche esier men schulen ymagine the dai of Cristis birthe to be present in the dai as lijk therto markid in the 
<PB REF="00000379.tif" N="269"> &yogh;eer, than in an other dai not so lijk therto; and men schulen esier ymagine the dai of Cristis resurrec|cioun and the dai of Pentecost in the daies therto assigned bi more lijknes in the &yogh;eer, than in othere daies lasse therto like.</P>
<P>Now after these thre reulis and vpon hem y pro|cede thus: Ech man hath nede forto haue gode affec|ciouns anentis Crist, as upon his best freend; and this freend &yogh;eueth not to us his presence visibili; wherfore it is profitable to ech man for to ymagine this freend be present to us bodili and in a maner visibili. And sithen herto serueth ful weel and ful myche the ymage of Crist crucified, whilis and if the biholder ymagineth Crist to be strei&yogh;t abrode bodili thoru&yogh; the bodi of the same ymage, heed to heed, hond to hond, breste to breste, foot to foot,&mdash;therfore the oolde practik of deuoute Cristen men was forto so ymagyne; thou&yogh; thei knewen and bileeueden weel ynou&yogh;, that it was not so in deede as thei deuoutli ymagineden. In this ymaginacioun thei helden hem silf forto meete bodili and presentli with Crist in Palme-Sunday, in which dai &yogh;eerli thei ymagineden the same firste dai be in which Crist came visibli riding into Ierusalem and was mett of the Iewis singing to him: <I>Osanna to the sone of Dauith.</I> And so al what in suche proces|siouns was seid and sungun toward the crosse in eelde daies of the chirche in Palme-Sundai was seid of Crist and to Crist ymagined to be bodili present with and in the crucifix or crosse, which the peple in proces|sioun bihelden.</P>
<P>And herbi &yogh;it into ferther encrecing of deuocioun and good affeccioun to be gendrid upon Crist, thei crepiden to ward and to such an ymage of the crucifix in Good Fridai; not as thou&yogh; thei crepiden thanne and there to noon other thing saue to the ymage, but that thei aftir her ymaginacioun crepiden to the persoon of Crist, which bi her ymaginacioun was 
<PB REF="00000380.tif" N="270"> bodili strei&yogh;t forth with the bodi of the ymage. And &yogh;it ferther into more loue and good affeccioun to be gendrid, thei kessiden the feet of the ymage; not as that the feet of the ymage weren al that thei there kissiden, but that ther with thei kessiden the feet of Crist whom thei ymagineden to be there in bodili maner present.

And so it mai be seid that no thing is seid and sungun to the nakid and bare crosse in processioun of Palme-Sundai, nei|ther eny creping or offring or kissing is maad to the crosse in Good Fridai; but al this is doon to Cristis persoon in his manhede, which is ymagined there to be in and with the ymage crucified and strei&yogh;t thoru&yogh; the ymage crucified, heed to heed, hond to hond, foot to foot; thou&yogh; it be not trowid so to be, but thou&yogh; the contrarie is trowid to be.

<P>But so it is, that these now rehercid textis and processis meenen not ferther than that the preestis and dekenes of the Oold Testament schulden not haue part and lott in the firste parting of the lond of Iewry to the children and kinredis comyng out of Iacob, as it is open ynou&yogh; to ech man diligentli reding the placis out of whiche the now alleggid textis ben drawe.

For her of the pleyner vndirstonding it is to wite that Iacob hadde xij. sones, out of which xij. sones camen xij. large kinredis of peplis; of whiche xij. sones the names were these: Ruben, Symeon, Leuy, Iudas, Isa|char, Zabulon, Ioseph, Beniamyn, Dan, Neptalim, Gad, and Aser; and the oon of these xij. sones and the kinrede which came out of him, (that is to seie, Leuy and hise children or kinrede,) God chase to be preestis and dekenis as for the tyme of the Oold Testament. And for the reuerence which God wolde be &yogh;ouun to Ioseph, being oon of the xij. seid sones, God wolde that hise children and kinrede comyng out of him schulde be rekened and be takun for ij. kinredis vnder the names of hise ij. sones, whiche weren clepid Effraym and Manasses; and so God wolde that xij. kinredis of Iacobis children schulde be bisidis the kinrede of Leuy, which God chase into his clergie for thilk tyme of the Oold Testament, not withstonding that Iacob had not but xj. sones bisidis his seid sone Leuy. To whiche now seid xij. kinredis God bade that al the lond, (which was afterward clepid lond of Iewis, and into which thei schulden entre bi con|quest for special graunte mad ther upon to hem fro God,) schulde be departid bi lott, whanne thei schulde firste entre into it after her comyng out of Egipt; and the kinrede of Leuy, which God chase in to his clergie, schulde haue no part in this firste departing and lotting; for God wole purueie in othere wisis for hem, as sumwhat is open bi the textis bifore alleggid, and sumwhat more ther of schal anoon aftir here be seid.

<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument to the same purpos is this: Thou&yogh; God forbade that the kinrede of Leuy, being as for thanne his clergie, schulde haue part in the seid firste departing and lotting of the al hool lond, as is open bi the textis bifore sett in this i<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter, &yogh;it God purueied for hem in other wise; and bade, Numeri xxxv<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., to al the hool multitude of the seid xij. kinredis receyuyng the al hool lond bi the seid departing and lotting, that after the seid depart|ing and lotting mad to hem of al the hool lond, they schulden &yogh;eue to the kinrede of Leuy, being the clergie of preestis and dekenis, certein citees bi lott of her al hool receit with the suburbis of pasturis ligging to the same citees, that in tho citees the peple of clerkis my&yogh;ten sufficientli ynou&yogh; dwelle, and that in the seid pasturis of suburbis the same clerkis my&yogh;te sufficientli pasture her beestis.

<P>THE ij<SUP>e</SUP>. answere which may be mad to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. bifore going argument sett in the firste chapiter of this iij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti mai be this: Thou&yogh; bi the bidding of God the preestis and dekenys hadden in her verri lordschip 
<PB REF="00000398.tif" N="288"> tho xlviij. citees with the suburbis of the same citees; &yogh;it herbi rose not this, that thei hadden eny more of immouable godis in her lordschip and possessioun than was nedeful hem to vse and occupie in her owne de|menyng. And therto sownen tho wordis, Numeri xxxv<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., whiche ben bifore rehercid in the firste colour to the firste answere, whanne God seid thus, <I>&YOGH;eue &yogh;e to the dekenis citees forto dwelle in hem:</I> wherbi it wolde seme folewe ferther, that mo citees or othere citees than in whiche the preestis and de|kenys hadde nede to dwelle yn, was not Goddis wil that schulden be &yogh;oue to hem; and thanne folewith ferther, that it was not leeful thanne preestis and dekenys forto haue so manye housis and feeldis, that thei my&yogh;ten sette hem out to ferme and receyue &yogh;eerli rentis for hem.</P>
<P>To this answere muste be seid thus: This answere seith sooth in this, that it is likeli to be trewe that, in the firste endewing of the preestis and dekenys bi the xlviij. citees with her suburbis, thei receyueden no more of immouable godis than was necessarie hem silf to occupie in her owne demenyng; but whanne it is concludid forto folewe herof, that it was Goddis wil that the same preestis and dekenys schulden neuer aftirward receyue and haue into her lordschip eny immouable godis, whiche thei hadden no nede bi hem silf occupie bi her owne indwelling or tiling: certis it is to be seid, that this folewith not in fourme of gode argument. And also the contrarie ther of folewith of it which was ordeyned of God him silf to be doon, Leuyticus the laste chapiter. Forwhi it was ordeyned of God him silf, that if a lay persoon wolde offre and &yogh;eue an hous or a feeld to the clergie in the next &yogh;eer bifore the iubile &yogh;eer, (&yogh;he, thou&yogh; it were so ny&yogh; to the iubile &yogh;eer, that it were not but iiij. or v. daies bifore the iubile &yogh;eer,) the clergye my&yogh;te sille this hous or 
<PB REF="00000399.tif" N="289"> feeld to an other persoon than to him which &yogh;aue it to hem. And thanne anoon aftir, as soone as the iubile &yogh;eer were come, the same hous or feeld schulde turne a&yogh;en into the lordschip of the clergie for euer|more, as it is open, Leuytik the last chapiter. And as oon lay man my&yogh;te in this maner offre an hous or a feeld to the clergie, so ij. lay men or iij. lay men or xx. or an hundrid my&yogh;ten so do, that ech of hem schulde offre and &yogh;eue to the clergie an hous or a feeld; &yogh;he, and oon man my&yogh;te offre and &yogh;eue ij. or iij. housis and ij. or iij. feeldis, as is open ynou&yogh; to folewe of the proces there, which &yogh;eueth such licence in general withoute eny restreynyng.</P>
<P>Here upon y argue thus: In the next &yogh;eer going bifore the iubile &yogh;eer, (&yogh;he, in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. day bifore the iubile &yogh;eer,) whanne the clergie was endewid with immouable godis sufficientli forto exclude al nede to haue more of immouable godis, the clergie mi&yogh;te receyue an hous or a feeld &yogh;ouun to hem of the laife; (and bi lijk skile iiij. housis and iiij. feeldis &yogh;ouun to hem of the layfe;) and the clergie my&yogh;te thanne anoon forth with sille hem to lay persoonis othere and dyuerse fro the &yogh;euers.

Forwhi if this seiyng were trewe, thanne the clergie schulde not and ou&yogh;te not sille anoon forth with eny hous or feeld, which the lay peple hadde &yogh;eue to hem; and &yogh;it pleinli in the laste chapiter of Leuitik it is licencid to preestis and dekenis for to sille the hous or feeld which a lay persoon schal &yogh;eue to hem; &yogh;he, forto sille it anoon aftir the &yogh;ifte maad to hem; &yogh;he, and forto sille anoon forthwith to hem that &yogh;auen the hous and the feeld or to othere per|soones whiche &yogh;auen<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>&yogh;aue,</I> MS.

And so bi al this processe now bifore going (fro the bigynnyng of the firste argument markid in the firste chapiter of this present iij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti hiderto) it is weel proued, that to preestis and to othere clerkis of the Oold Testament it was not forbodun bi the lawe of God forto haue lordschip and in possessioun immouable godis; but it was licencid and grauntid to hem bi the lawe of God for to haue in lordschip and in possessioun citees, housis, and feeldis, and pasturis,&mdash;not oonli tho whiche thei helden in her owne demenys, but also mo othere<NOTE PLACE="foot">Perhaps we should read <I>othere mo.</I></NOTE> whiche thei my&yogh;ten sette forth to ferme and rente.

And so thilk peple my&yogh;te not iustli (as for thanne) haue chose Iesus or eny other persoon forto be her king; for thanne in that thei hadden be trai|touris to the Emperour and to Heroude, and thei hadden do wrong to him a&yogh;ens doom of resoun: which doom of resoun Crist him silf allowid; for he seide, (Math. xxij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., Mark xij<SUP>e</SUP>.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>xv</I><SUP>e</SUP>., MS.</NOTE> <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., and Luk xx<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.,) <I>&YOGH;elde &yogh;e to Cesar tho thingis that ben of Cesar, and to God tho thingis that ben of God.</I> And so, if Crist wolde haue consentid to the peple willing forto chese him her king, he had in that consentid to her wrongful doing. And therfore al the ensaumpling which Crist schewid, as in that, was no more than this: that ech man schulde fle, that he consente not to eny wrong|ful eleccioun or chesing mad vpon him.

<P>Also anoon aftir that thilk seid Cristen multitude biganne in Ierusalem, so greet persecucioun was maad vpon hem and upon the dekenes and the Apostilis, that alle the Cristen persoones whiche weren in Ieru|salem fledden out of Ierusalem, and weren disperclid abrode into othere dyuerse coostis and cuntrees, excepte oonli the Apostilis; as herof open storie is had, Acts viij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. in the bigynnyng.

<P>THE ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun is this: Doom of cleerli in kinde disposid resoun werneth not and let|tith not the seid thridde principal gouernaunce sett in the bigynnyng of the firste chapiter of this present iij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie. That this conclusion is trewe y proue thus: If eny such now seid doom of resoun schulde weerne and lette the seid iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce, thilk doom of resoun schulde be oon of these domes now suyngli to be rehercid. But so it is, that noon of hem so weerneth and lettith; but ech of hem is as semyng colour oonli and not a very prouyng doom, as in processe suyng schal be schewid. Wherfore doom of cleerli disposid resoun in kinde weerneth not and lettith not the seid iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premisse of this argument schal be proued bi long processe thus. The firste semyng colour in doom of resoun is this: Aftir the sentence of Crist, (Math. vij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. and Luk vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.,) <I>Such is the tre, which is the fruyt of the same tree;</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">This is not an exact quotation. See Matth. vii. 20; Luke vi. 44.</NOTE> so that bi the fruyt of the tree the same tree is knowun, whether he be good or bad. But so it is, that the fruyt of the chirchis riche endewing is synne of pride, of glotenye, of sy|monye, and so forth of manye othere. Wherfore the tree of hem is nau&yogh;t, which is the seid riche endewing.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng [colour] is this: If riche endewing hadde be profitable to the clergie and to al the hool chirche of God, Crist him silf bi his owne persoon 
<PB REF="00000432.tif" N="322"> hadde endewid richeli the clergie of the chirche in hise daies, and hadde bede that aftir his passing out of this lijf men schulden make suche endewingis. But Christ not so endewid his chirche in hise daies, nei|ther bede the clergie aftir hise daies in this lijf forto be richeli endewid. Forwhi therof is no mensioun in al the Newe Testament. Wherfore such riche en|dewing of the clergie is not profitable to the clergie, neither to the other partie of the chirche.</P>
<P>The first premisse of this argument muste needis be grauntid, as it wolde seeme. Forwhi<NOTE PLACE="foot">Perhaps <I>sithen</I> should be in|serted.</NOTE> Crist loued his chirche and the clergie therof more than eny creature of this world can loue the chirche and the clergie; and the proof of loue is execucioun of werk and of deede; it seemeth folewe, that sithen othere persoones for loue which thei hadden to the clergie endewiden the clergie, miche rather Crist for loue wolde haue endewid the clergie, or wolde haue mad special ordinaunce therfore bi deede, or at the leest bi word, if he hadde knowe that such riche endew|ing hadde be to his clergie necessarie or profitable. And so the firste premysse of this ij<SUP>e</SUP>. argument semeth to be trewe. The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of the argu|ment is also openli trewe. Wherfore the conclusioun concludid bi tho ij. premyssis in the same argument is also trewe.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. is this: Seint Ierom in writing the lijf of Malk the monk seith, that <I>sithen the chirche wexid in dignitees, he decrecid in vertues.</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">"Scribere disposui . . . . . ab adventu Salvatoris usque ad nos|tram &aelig;tatem, id est, ab apostolis usque ad nostri temporis f&aelig;cem, quomodo et per quos Christi ecclesia nata sit et adulta, persecutionibus creverit, et martyriis coronata sit; et postquam ad Christianos principes venerit, potentia quidem et divitiis major sed virtutibus minor facta sit."

<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile is this: It is not semeli, honeste, conuenient, and according, that bischopis and abbotis (whiche schulden be grete sterers to the lay partie into deedis of pitee, and schulde be bridelis or refreynyng meenys to the lay parti fro deedis of cruelte and of vnpitee, and that bi deede in ensaum|pling and bi word in preching, counceiling, and ex|orting) schulden do and vse deedis strecching and disposing and abling into the grettist vnpitee and grettist cruelnes that mai be; but so doon summe bischopis and abbotis bi sum of her temperal vnmou|able endewing. Forwhi bi summe of her endewingis summe bischopis and abbotis han and holden courtis, in whiche iugementis ben &yogh;ouun in her name, aucto|rite, and power into hangement and into deeth.

<P>For answere and assoiling to these semyng skilis and colouris, and first for answere to the first of hem y graunte weel that "such is the tree which is the fruyt of the tree;" that is to seie, if the fruyt of a tree be badde, the tree is badde; and if the fruyt of a tree is good, the tree is good. Forwhi the tree is not oonli an occasioun of the fruyt, but he is the cause<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>is cause,</I> MS.

But certis so is it not bitwixe ricchessis and the synnes whiche comen fro out and bi tho ricchessis. For tho ricchessis ben not causis of tho synnes, but ben oonli occasiouns of tho synnes; and that oonli to the freel and culpable wil 
<PB REF="00000436.tif" N="326"> of men, which is the verri cause wirching tho synnes. And therfore, bitwixe the hauyng, bi which a tree hath him silf anentis his fruyt, and the hauyng, bi which ricches hath him silf anentis the synnes com|yng fro, out, and bi him,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>bihim,</I> MS.</NOTE> is a greet dyuersite. Cer|tis, if the synnes comyng forth fro and bi ricches weren causid of the ricches, and the ricches were cause of tho synnes and made tho synnes, as the tree makith the fruyt, the now first mad skile and argument schulde procede weel, and schulde proue sufficientli his entent. But sithen it is so, that ricchessis ben not causis of the vicis whiche comen fro and bi hem, but the freel wil of the man which vsith tho ricchessis is the making cause of tho synnes, and the ricches is not more than an occasioun of hem oonli, therfore the firste argument and skile is not worth. What difference is bitwixe a cause of a thing and an occasioun of the same thing schal be tau&yogh;t aftir in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti of this present book the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter, where more is seid perteynyng to this present answere.</P>
<P>That ricches is not cause of eny synne mai be proued thus: Thou canst not seie whi and wherfore ricches schulde be cause of synne, saue for that fro, out, and bi ricches synne cometh.

<P>And thanne ferther: If this were to be holde trewe, that for this that ricches is occasioun of al the synne which out, fro, and bi him cometh, ricches were badde and ou&yogh;te not be had; but that the hauying of it were viciose and vnleeful, and that for this that yuel cometh ther fro and ther bi:&mdash;certis thanne for lijk skile, sithen fro and bi the greet ricches in which the aungel Lucifer was sett and putt, came his synne and the synne of manie othere aungelis and her per|petuel dampnacioun, it wolde folewe that thilk riching of the aungel was vicioseli doon of God; and so God ther yn was viciose. And sithen this folewith not, as ech man muste needis graunte, it folewith that ech man muste also lijk weel graunte, that thou&yogh; out and fro and bi temperal ricches (as out, fro, and bi an oc|casioun oonli) cometh myche synne and other yuel, therof folewith not neithir is concludid and proued the hauying of the same ricches to be yuel.</P>
<P>Also thus: Other wise cometh not yuel and good out, fro, and bi ricchessis which preestis and other men holden and vsen, than as out, fro, and bi her tungis comen forth bothe yuel spechis and gode spechis, preisingis to God and dispreisingis to God, profitable teching to the vnkunnyng and vnprofitable speche to the vnkunnyng, and so forth of manye miche neces|sarie deedis doable bi mennys tungis and of manye ful wickid and ful miche noiose deedis comyng forth bi mennys tungis. Forwhi tungis be not but the in|strumentis of the fre wil, bi and with which the free wil of man wirchith sumwhile good sumwhile yuel; and so richessis ben not but instrumentis of and to the fre<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>to fre,</I> MS.

<P>What schal therfore be doon to her tungis? Schulen thei be kutt of, for that thei ben founde occasions of yuel? Certis, nay; for thanne bi thilk kutting of schulde also ther with be kutt of alle the godis, whiche bi tho tungis mowe also be doon and had.

<P>FOR answere to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile, the first pre|mysse is to be denied, which is this: "If riche en|dewing had be profitable to the clergie and to al the hool chirche of God, Crist him silf bi his owne persoon hadde endewid richeli the clergie of the chirche in hise daies," <I>et c&aelig;tera.</I> Forwhi if this premysse now denyed were trewe, certis, bi lijk skile 
<PB REF="00000442.tif" N="332"> Crist in his owne persoon hadde ordeyned dekenes to be in his clergie; sithen it was profitable dekenes to be in the clergie of his chirche, as it is open, Acts vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. at the bigynnyng. And &yogh;it Crist bi him silf not so ordeyned, but the Apostlis and the peple to gidere hem chosen and ordeyneden, as it is open there, Acts vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. And therfore the now rehercid firste premysse of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile is to be denyed.</P>
<P>Also into this same purpos thus: The rehercid firste premisse my&yogh;te not be trewe, but if he schulde meene and vndirstonde that Crist ou&yogh;te and wolde haue ordeyned bi him silf and in his owne persoon al that is nedeful to his clergie of his chirche, as is open ynow. But this meenyng is vntrewe. Forwhi breed and wijn and ale and housing and clothing and manie othere thingis maad bi mennys craftis ben necessarie to be had in persoones of his clergie, and &yogh;it Crist in his owne persoon and bi him silf ordeyned not and &yogh;eueth not to eny man breed or wyin or gowne or hood or hous; but he &yogh;eueth bi him silf and in his persoon maters of which breed and wijn and housis and clothis ben to be mad, and therwith he &yogh;eueth to men hondis and feet and membris of the bodi and inward and outward sensityue wittis and resoun and wil and moving powers, bi whiche alle applied to gidere men mowen make breed, wijn, housis, and clothis. And in lijk maner Crist &yogh;af to the Apostlis witt of resoun for to knowe that dekenhode was pro|fitable to his clergie, and Crist &yogh;af to hise Apostlis wil for to chese tho dekenes; and so in that Crist &yogh;aue to hem dekenes mediatli, that is to seie, bi meenis bifore &yogh;ouun to the Apostlis. And if this be trewe, whi not in lijk maner, for lijk skile, it is to be seid, that Crist &yogh;af mediatli, (that is to seie, bi meene &yogh;iftis to his clergie,) the endewing of immouable godis, which the clergie now hath: for as miche as Crist &yogh;aue to the clergie witt and wisdom forto knowe 
<PB REF="00000443.tif" N="333"> thilk endewing be profitable to the clergie, and also wil forto aske and receyue the same endewing; thou&yogh; Crist &yogh;aue not to his clergie thilk same endewing bi him silf immediatli, (that is to seie, withoute eny bi|fore &yogh;ouun meenys,) ri&yogh;t euen as he &yogh;aue dekenhode to his clergie mediatli, thou&yogh; he &yogh;aue not the same dekenhode to his clergie immediatli? And so open it is herbi, that the firste premisse of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile is to be denied.</P>
<P>And whanne it is argued ferther, that thilk first premisse muste be trewe, for ellis God loued not so miche his clergie as men endewing his clergie loueden his clergie, certis this folewith not. Forwhi at sum while it mai so be, that the &yogh;euer or benefeter forto &yogh;eue mediatli, (that is to seie bi a meene to the re|ceyuer,) schal be more profitable to the receyuer than schulde be, if the &yogh;euer schulde &yogh;eue the same &yogh;ifte or benefet immediatli bi him silf to the same receyuer. Also at sumwhile it mai be so, that more good and more honeste or more preising and worschip schal come, (alle thingis considerid and biholdun,) to the &yogh;euer, if the &yogh;euer &yogh;eue mediatly his &yogh;ifte or benefete, than schulde come if he &yogh;af the same &yogh;ifte or benefet immediatli bi him silf. And so it mai be ful weel, that not for defaut of loue had to the receyuer, neither for the lasse loue as in that and for that born anentis the receyuer, the &yogh;euer &yogh;eueth his &yogh;ifte or benefet to the receyuer, but for the more loue had and born bi the &yogh;euer anentis the receyuer.</P>
<P>Also it mai be ful ofte, that for the more good to be doon al abou&yogh;te, (thou&yogh; not al to the receyuer,) it bisemeth and it is sitting, and therfore it is to be doon, that the &yogh;euer &yogh;eue his &yogh;ifte and benefet medi|atli and not immediatli: and &yogh;it this doing is not so 
<PB REF="00000444.tif" N="334"> maad for the lasse loue to the receyuer, than schulde be if he &yogh;af it immediatli.

And herbi it is to be feelid and seid, that in this wirching of Crist, bi which he wrou&yogh;t medi|atli into the endewing of his clergie, was as greet or gretter schewyng of his loue toward his clergie, thanne was the schewing of loue which peple mad to his clergie bi that that thei wrou&yogh;ten immediatli into the same endewing.

<P>To the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile y answere thus: I graunte that Ierom seide tho wordis, <I>Sithen the chirche wexid in dignitees or in possessiouns, he decrecid in ver|tues:</I> as thou&yogh; his meenyng had be this, "Euer and alwey sithen the chirche wexid in possessiouns, he decrecid in vertues." But what here of, thou&yogh; he 
<PB REF="00000445.tif" N="335"> so seide? Certis his tunge was not the key of heuen or of erthe, neither had power to make eny thing to be trewe or fals, or other wise to be than he couthe fynde bifore it to be trewe or fals in doom of resoun or in Holi Scripture.

<P>First that tho wordis weren not trewe, it semeth herbi. How euer kunnyng and weel leerned preestis and prelatis a this<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>athis,</I> MS.</NOTE> side of the Apostlis weren to gidere in<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>in</I> is interlineated, perhaps by a later hand.</NOTE> eny tyme in the clergie of<NOTE PLACE="foot">So the original scribe, rightly: but a later hand has made an erasure and changed <I>of</I> into <I>or.</I></NOTE> the chirche bifore his endewing in riche possessiouns, so kunnyng and weel leerned preestis and prelatis han ben to gidere sithen and aftir that the chirche was endewid bi vnmouable possessions; &yogh;he, and myche kun|nynger and better leerned; and also therwith mo suche han be<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>ben,</I> MS.

For, who euer can schewe that bifore the daies of Hillari, Ambrose, Ierom, and Aus|tyn, and Gregori weren in the Latyn chirche so worthi techers with holi lyuyng to gidere as thei weren and as her successouris weren, y schal &yogh;eue to him myn arme.</P>
<P>Ferthermore, how euer goostli almysful preestis and prelatis in preching and in writing profitable bokis weren to gidere in eny tyme bifore the seid endew|ing, so almysful in the seid goostli almes han ben to gidere sithen<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>sithen</I> is interlineated in a later (?) hand.</NOTE>; &yogh;he, and miche more almysful, bi

<P>Ferthermore, as holi confessouris and as manie in the same lengthe of tyme han be of preestis and pre|latis sithen the seid endewing, as were bifore the seid endewing a this<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>athis,</I> MS., and similarly a little below.</NOTE> side the Apostlis; and as holi and as manye and mo of martiris bi deeth, (and other wise troublid bi exile and bi prisonyng,) hanbe<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>hanben,</I> MS.

Forwhi alle the bischopis and othere preestis, that weren in tho daies thoru&yogh; manie &yogh;eeris to gidere, weren ful fewe. And also thou&yogh; it hadde be so, that mo bischopis and preestis hadden be martiris in the daies of tho princis than in the daies of princis a this side the Emperour Con|stantyn, &yogh;it it was oonli for this, that persecucioun of tirantis was redier in tho daies than was sithen in the daies of Constantyn and aftir hise daies; and it

For y dare weel seie that Ierom, Ambrose, Austin, and Gregori weren as redi in wil forto haue suffrid marterdom, if it hadde be putt to hem, as euer was eny othir preest or bischop which bifore the endewing of the chirche was martirid a this side<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>seide,</I> MS.

For in the bigynnyng of the seid endewing and bi long tyme aftir, al the while that weel leerned men and weel proued men in lyuyng were takun into prelacie, the chirche grewe vpward bothe in kunnyng and in lyuyng, as therto ful miche the seid riche endewing helpid; and ther|fore this, that the chirche or the clergie sithen the seid endewing hath decrecid in vertues, came bi an other thing yn and bi an other wey than bi the seid riche endewing; which other thing and wey, if it were kutt awey, the riche endewing schulde do ful miche good and lette miche yuel.

In lijk maner al the hool chirche of God is of such kinde that, namelich after a certeyn tyme of his age, he appeirid, and schal appeire contynueli; as Crist ther of prophecied, Math. xxiiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., and Mark xiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., and Poul, first Thim. iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., and ij<SUP>e</SUP>.

Weel thanne, sithen this is the cause whi out of the briggis contynuel appeiring sithen he was en|dewid folewith not thilk endewing forto be to him yuel, bi the same or lijk skile, thou&yogh; the chirche bothe in the laife and in the clergie kepe his nature of contynuel appeiring aftir the tyme in which riche en|dewing was &yogh;euun therto into his supporting, therof folewith not that the endewing mad to the clergie is vnprofitable to the chirche and is synful and vnleeful; no more than that the endewing &yogh;ouun to the brigge of Londoun into the supporting of his contynuel ap|peiring is to the same brigge harmeful. The seid Fadir <I>In vitas Patrum</I> schulde therfore haue seid more 
<PB REF="00000449.tif" N="339"> than he seide in the bifore rehercid wordis, if bi hise wordis he wolde haue meened that the endewing of the clergie hadde be yuel doon. For he muste haue seid thus miche: "Alwey and euer sithen the chirche wexid in possessiouns he decrecid in vertues, and thilk wexing in possessiouns was cause or occasioun of thilk decrecing in vertues; therefore this endew|ing of the chirche in possessiouns was yuel doon." And if thou bere him an hond that he meened so myche bi hise bifore rehercid wordis, thou&yogh; he not alle hem out spake, certis &yogh;it y schal proue that of al this meenyng, thus largeli born an hond to him, folewith not the seid endewing to be yuel doon and to be vnleeful. Forwhi, if he meened that the seid endewing was cause of the seid chirchis decrecing in vertues, he seide not ther yn trewe; sithen it is proued bifore in the viij<SUP>e</SUP>.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>vij</I><SUP>e</SUP>., MS.</NOTE> chapiter, and schal more be proued aftir in the <NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the number.

<P>FERTHERMORE for to trete upon this Fadris seiyng, thou&yogh; this what is now seid and proued, (that the 
<PB REF="00000450.tif" N="340"> seid endewing to be oonli an occasioun of yuel, and not to be cause of yuel,) is ynou&yogh; forto lette of the oold Fadris seid wordis folewe the riche endewing of the clergie be yuel doon; &yogh;it more than this mai be sett therto into the same purpos, and in this maner; that, thou&yogh; a gouernance be an occasioun of yuel, it is to be considerid ferther of how miche good the same gouernaunce is occasioun and of how myche yuelis letting and forbaring the same gouernaunce is an occasioun, with this, that the same gouernaunce is an occasioun of sum yuel, thou&yogh; not of ri&yogh;t myche yuel. And if of al the yuel, which cometh bi the gouernaunce, the same gouernaunce is not but an oc|casioun and not cause; and therwith the same gouer|naunce is occasion of myche good, and is occasioun of letting miche yuel; and herwith it is not knowun whethir the yuel comyng bi the seid gouernaunce is more than the yuel which is lettid bi the same gouernaunce;&mdash;certis no man ou&yogh;te thilk while iuge that thilk gouernaunce ou&yogh;te be leid awey. But so it is in this present purpos, that thou&yogh; the riche endew|ing of the clergie be an occasioun of myche yuel, &yogh;it it is an occasioun of myche good; and it is also occasioun of a&yogh;en putting miche synful yuel, which ellis schulde falle; and no man can iuge pleinli and sureli, that the yuel which cometh bi the seid riche endewing is gretter than is the yuel which is lettid to be bi the same endewyng; as y commytte to the discrecioun of wise men for to it ouerse and iuge. And her with it is trewe, that the seid riche endew|ing is not cause of the yuelis which comen occa|sionarili oonli bi it, as it is bifore proued in the [viij<SUP>e</SUP>.]<NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the number.</NOTE> chapiter of this present iij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie. Wherfore no wise man neither eny other man without ouer greet booldnes of presumpcioun ou&yogh;te iuge and seie, 
<PB REF="00000451.tif" N="341"> that the seid riche endewing ou&yogh;te be kutt awey for the yuel of which the same endewing is occasioun.</P>
<P>&YOGH;it ferther, not withstonding al this, it mai seme bothe bi reson and bi Holi Scripture, that the yuel which is lettid bi the seid riche endewing is gretter than the yuel which is comyng out ther of and ther bi. And forto proue this first bi resoun y procede in this wise: It is miche harder forto suffre peyne of fleisch in this lijf than it is forto forgo and forbere lustis of fleisch in this lijf, as ech man may soone aspie in experience: and also bi resoun, for bi suffring of peyne bodili deeth cometh miche sooner than bi forbering of delectaciouns oonli. And if this be trewe, thanne it is more perel to a man for to bere him weel in suffring of peyne, than is forto bere him weel in forbering of delectaciouns and lustis. But so it is, that al the perel which is in hauyng of grete ricch|essis is, lest a man bere him not weel in forbering lustis; and the perel which is in lacking richessis is, lest a man bere him not weel and strongli in suffring of peyne. Wherfore nedis folewith, that more perel is to a man,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>a man,</I> MS. (first hand, a cor|rector having wrongly erased the article).</NOTE> whanne he is sett in to suffring of peyn, than whanne he is sett into forbering of lustis. And thanne ferther thus: But so it is, that whanne a man is sett forto reioice grete ricchessis, he is sett forto forbere lustis strongli and manli; and whanne he [is] sette forto lacke tho ricchessis, he is sett forto suffre peynes strongli and manli. Wherfore folewith needis, that gretter perel is in lacking of ricchessis than in the hauyng of hem; and gretter perel nou&yogh;where is,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>is</I> is interlineated by a later (?) hand.</NOTE> saue where grettir yuel is likeli to come: wherefore gretter yuel were likeli to come in the clergie, if thei hadden lak of plenteuose ricchessis, than if thei hadden plenteuose ricchessis.

<P>For to proue the same bi Holi Scripture y procede thus: Frowhens schule we trowe this came, that so manye pseudo or false Apostlis preching for lucre weren in the chirche in tyme of the Apostlis, as of such spekith Poul and Peter and Iohun and Iudas in her Epistilis, than fro this now to be seid?

<P>For more pleyner vndirstonding to be had upon the now bifore rehercid wordis of Salamon, Prouerb. xxx<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., and forto wite what Salamon meened in hem, and forto therbi se how it is trewe that greeter yuel cometh bi lak of ricches than bi the hauyng of ricches, it is to vndirstonde and to holde that Salamon in the now seid text meened bi "sufficience" not oonli the hauour which fillith or remedieth al his lak and nede now had, but which is ther with so abiding that it schal not lasse; or ellis not so myche lasse, but that it schal alwey aftir<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>aftir</I> is added in a later hand, which has made erasures in the text.</NOTE> be able to fille and remedie al his lak and nede, which is for eny tyme likeli to falle.

<P>THE iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. resoun is this: If suche as is bifore seid a voice was spokun in the eir, whanne Constantyn had maad at Rome the endewing which he made, thilk voice was so maad and spoken in the eir for this, that thanne first endewing by immovable pos|sessiouns entride into the chirche; or ellis for this, that thanne first greet habundaunt endewing bi im|movable possessiouns entride into the chirche.</P>

And so fynali folewith that for no cause thilk voice was maad, and therefore no such voice at al was in the eir than mad, thou&yogh; bi sum corrupcioun of leesing the fame of thilk voice hath long tyme be had and contynued.</P>
<P>That this is trewe what is now bifore seid, that the First Constantyn Emperour endewid not Pope Siluester neither eny oon chirche in Rome with eny greetly habundant and riche vnmouable possessiouns, y mai proue bi manie euydencis; of whiche oon is this: If the seid Constantyn had mad such greet habundaunt riche endewing to Siluester and to the chirche in which Siluester sate, Damasus Pope had mad mensioun of thilk same endewing in the storie which he writith to Ierom, and that for dyuerse 
<PB REF="00000470.tif" N="360"> skilis now anoon aftir to be rehercid; but not with|stonding this the seid Damasus makith no mensioun of the seid greet endewing born an hond to Con|stantin, that he schulde it make to Siluester Pope. Wherfore treuthe is, that thilk greet endewing so born an hond was not maad.</P>
<P>The skilis ben these: Damasus was preied of Ierom, that Damasus schulde write to Ierom as miche as Damasus couthe fynde in Rome what was doon fro Petir into the dai of Damasus Pope; as the epistle of Ierom sent to Damasus and the epistle of Damasus to Ierom beren witnes. And Damasus writith a&yogh;en to Ierom the now seid storie, and seith that al what he couthe and my&yogh;te wite, encerche, fynde, and knowe what was doon fro Seint Petris daies into hise owne daies thanne lyuyng he hadde write in the now seid storie, which he sende to Ierom. Wherfore sithen it is not likeli that such a notable deede of endewing, if it hadde be doon bi Constantyn, schulde haue be vnknowe to Damasus succeding to Siluester withinne an hundrid of &yogh;eeris, more than othere smale endew|ingis doon bi Constantyn to diuerse chirchis of which Damasus makith mensioun alredi, it folewith that if thilk greet endewing of the Pope hadde be doon bi Constantyn, Damasus wolde haue write of it, as weel as of othere smaler and lasse endewingis mad to<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>to the,</I> MS. (first hand).</NOTE> chirchis in Rome bi Constantyn.</P>
<P>An other skile is: If thilk greet endewing hadde be mad to Siluester, Damasus schulde haue be in posses|sioun of the same endewing in the same tyme in which he wroot to Ierom; and of no thing Damasus my&yogh;te bettir knowe than of the same thing which he helde in possessioun. Wherfore more sureli than of eny other thing, which Damasus wroot to Ierom in 
<PB REF="00000471.tif" N="361"> the seid story, he wolde haue write of thilk greet; endewing, if eny such greet endewing hadde thanne be: and sithen Damasus not so wroot, it folewith that noon such greet endewing was bi Constantyn doon.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal euydence is this: If eny such now seid endewing was mad bi Constantyn, sum mensioun schulde haue be mad therof in sum funda|mental and credible stori or cronicle. But so it is, that of thilk endewing no stori or cronicle makith mensioun, saue the legende or storie of Siluestris gestis and the oon bifore seid epistle putt and ascryued vn|likeli to Constantyn, and tho stories and cronicles which taken of it and folewen it; and neither thilk storiyng of Siluestris gestis neither the seid epistle is not credible neithir worthi be allowid, as it is schewid bifore in the next chapiter, and as schal better be cleer aftir in this present chapiter. Wherfore it is not to be takun and to be trowid as a trouthe, that Constantyn made eny such seid so<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>so</I> is interlineated in a later hand.</NOTE> greet endewing.</P>
<P>The iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal euidence is this: The worthi and famose and credible stori clepid <I>Thre departid storie</I> (mad of thre moost famose and credible storiers in Greek lond in the daies of Theodosie not long after Constantyn) makith mensioun in the laste chapiter of the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. book, and in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter and vj<SUP>e</SUP>.<NOTE PLACE="foot">The last reference is wrong; perhaps c. 35 is the place intended.</NOTE> chapiter of the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. book, and bi manye othere chapitris in the hool book, that the greet Constantyn in hise laste daies, whanne he trowid be ny&yogh;e his deeth, made his testament and departid his hool empire into thre par|ties, and tho thre parties he biquathe to hise thre sones, Constantinus, Constancius, and Constans; and in special he assigned and biquathe the lordschip of the west parti, which was Rome, with al the cuntrey

But this schulde not haue be trewe, if the first grete Constantyn had maad the seid greet habundaunt upon him born an hond endew|ing. Forwhi thanne the sones of the same Constantyn my&yogh;ten not haue regned vpon Romayns and upon peple of al the cuntre ligging west fro Greek cuntre. Wherfore thilk seid greet endewing born upon the First Constantyn was neuere doon: and therfore the seid epistle ascriued to Costantyn,<NOTE PLACE="foot">So the MS., perhaps by a clerical error, but?</NOTE> and also the storie of Siluestris gestis ben not but vntrewe apocrifis.</P>
<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP>. principal euydence is this: After the deeth of Siluester Pope bi ccl. &yogh;eer, Boneface the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. and Pope of Rome, willing forto halewe the hous in Rome clepid Panteon, and forto make it<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>it</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> a temple of alle martris, askide of Focas, being emperour bothe of the Eest and of the West, (that is to seie, of Greke lond and of the cuntrey ligging in west fro Greek lond,) leue forto so do; and he askid of Focas, that Focas schulde &yogh;eue to him thilk hous Panteon, that he my&yogh;te ther of make a temple of alle martris, which was bifore a temple of alle ydolis.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Bed. <I>Eccl.

<PB REF="00000473.tif" N="363"> hadde not be lord therof. Wherfore the seid large endewing born upon Constantyn to be mad to Sil|uester Pope was neuere doon. An so eftsoone it is open that the seid epistle ascryued to Constantyn and the storie of Siluestris gestis ben not but vntrewe apocrifes.</P>
<P>The vj<SUP>e</SUP>. principal evidence is this: In alle the daies fro the deeth of the Firste Constantyn in to the daies of the Firste Charlis (being king of Fraunce and em|perour of Rome to gidere bi v. C. &yogh;eer aftir the deeth of Siluester) regniden in successioun euermore oon em|perour after an other pesibili to gidere and at oonys upon the eest cuntrey of Greek lond, and upon the west cuntre of Rome, and bi west Rome, as is open ynou&yogh; in cronicles; and how and whi fro thens<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>frothens,</I> MS., and similarly below, p. 366.</NOTE> weren ij. emperouris oon in the West vpon Germanie and an other upon the Eest in Greek lond the cro|nicles declaren pleinli.

But this my&yogh;te not haue be trewe, if the seid greet endewing born upon Constantyn hadde be doon. Wherfore truthe is that it was neuere doon.</P>
<P>Neuertheles a&yogh;ens thilk endewing which the seid Damasus Pope spekith in his storie writun to Ierom, and which endewing Damasus berith upon the First Constantyn to be mad to chirchis in Rome and to mynystrie in hem, y wole not replie, neither argue, neither holde and trowe, bi cause that forto ther a&yogh;ens holde y haue noon euydence: but certis thilk endewing maad bi Constantyn in vnmouable godis to dyuerse chirchis in Rome, of which endewing so spekith

<P>The vij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal evidence in to the same purpos is this: Bi manye hundrid &yogh;eeris after the deeth of Pope Siluester the eleccioun of the pope mad at Rome was sende into Greke lond, where the emperour was oftir<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>aftir,</I> MS.</NOTE> and lenger to gidere than at Rome, forto be confermed or admittid of the emperour; as can be proued bi sufficient credible cronicles and stories, and in special forto seie in the cronicle of Martyn, where he spekith of Pope Vitilian.<NOTE PLACE="foot">"Hic (Vitalianus) nuncios suos direxit ad imperatorem juxta con|suetudinem significans de sua ordi|natione.

But whanne it is so, that the king &yogh;eueth to a bischop or to an abbot into almes or into sum other good deede therbi to be doon the now seid avauntage, which may come honestli and iustli to the king, he comittith not to the same bischop or abbot power forto sitte and knowe and iuge in the court whos avauntage the king &yogh;eueth to the bischop or abbot; but the king comyttith the power forto sitte, knowe, and iuge to a stiward which in the kingis name schal sitte and iuge and condempne into deeth and execute the sentence or commytte ferther thilk execucioun to othere vndir him in the kingis name; thou&yogh; the king graunte and or|deyne that the stiward bringe to the bisschop or abbot al the avauntage of the court, which the same stiward schulde iustli bringe to the king him silf, if the king

<P>And ferther, euen as whanne a formali mad argument is mad of ij. premyssis concluding a conclusioun, if bothe premyssis ben trewe, the conclusioun needis is trewe; so whanne an argument is mad schortli, so that the oon premisse is expressid in which the gretter strengthe of the argument lithe, and the other pre|mysse is stille vnspokun for schortnes; &yogh;it, if thilk oon premysse expressid be trewe, needis muste the con|clusioun be trewe.

<P>The viij<SUP>e</SUP>. trouthe is this: If the lay peple &yogh;aue at eny tyme to her curatis and to the successouris of her curatis perpetuali this ri&yogh;t forto clayme, aske, and haue &yogh;eerli certein offringis to be doon and tithis going out fro her wynnyngis and renewyngis, as fyndingis of the same curatis and successouris into deedis of her cure to be doon, thilk ri&yogh;t so &yogh;ouun to the seid curatis and her successouris is lijk to the ri&yogh;t which my&yogh;te be &yogh;ouun to the same curatis or to othere curatis and her successouris forto cleyme, aske, and haue &yogh;eerly a free rente of money going out fro certeyn housis or londis, as a fynding to the same curatis forto do the deedis of her cure.

<P>Also thus: It is to be seid that summe temporal goodis weren &yogh;ouun to preestis being curatis into her lijflode in the first maner of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. trouthe, and that bi cause of Cristis speche, Luk x<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., in long proces, wheryn he seith, <I>The werkman is worthi his fynd|ing,</I> and bi cause of Poulis speche, i<SUP>e</SUP>.

<P>Forthermore, for more declaracioun to be had in this mater, it is to vndirstonde that a &yogh;ift mad in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner now bifore spokun muste needis be dyuers and othir than is the &yogh;ifte mad in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. or iij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner. Forwhi, whanne a &yogh;ifte is mad in the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner, how euer soone the condicioun is not fulfillid, the &yogh;ifte is voide and cesith, bi cause the condicioun is a parti of the forme of &yogh;euyng; but whanne a &yogh;ifte is maad vndir entent or hope, thilk entent or hope is not a condicion and a parti of the &yogh;euyng, but it is a circumstaunce of the &yogh;euyng, which is clepid eende or purpos of the &yogh;euer. For|whi, sithen euery vertuose &yogh;ift is doon for sum eende, (for no man mai eny deede do avisidli withoute sum eende and entent and purpos therto take, as y haue proued in othere placis,) it wolde ellis folewe needis, that euery &yogh;ifte maad bi delyberacioun were a &yogh;ifte

<P>Also the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner of &yogh;ift, which is a couenaunt, is a double &yogh;ifte of the principal &yogh;euer and of the re|ceyuer. Forwhi the principal &yogh;euer &yogh;eueth a thing or a dede, and the receyuer &yogh;eueth a&yogh;enward, as therto or therfore coupling an other thing or deede; and open it is, that the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner of &yogh;ifte is not but oon symple &yogh;ifte; and therfore the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner and the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner needis ben dyuerse, and not oon and the same.

<P>If thou seie the now rehercid opynyoun of the seid clerk to be groundid here on [this,] that sufficient mark and euydence may be take, that al my successouris schulen be viciose mys vsers of tho godis, bi cause that y and so manye of my predecessouris han be in habit and in custom mys vsers of the same godis, certis this ground is vntrewe.

<P>It is also a&yogh;ens the witnes of Holi Scripture.

<P>Also a&yogh;ens the seid opinioun may be argued thus: If the seid opinioun be trewe, thanne sithen the en|dewing of princis is mad to hem for that thei schulden weel vse hem in spending hem vertuoseli aboute the good temporal reuling of her peplis, (namelich where that princis ben endewid bi the comounte,) it wolde folewe, if princis weren customabili mys vsers of tho godis, that the comoun peple schulden take fro hem tho godis hem abiding in her statis of princehode. And if this schulde be doon, manye myscheefis wolden therof folewe. Wherfore the seid opinioun is not to be holde no more for the seid habituacioun and cus|tom, than if the mys vce be withoute the seid habi|tuacioun or custom; for in euer either caas lijk wrong schulde be doon to the successouris. And open it is, that of what euer gouernaunce or deede folewith and cometh bi his strengthe vnri&yogh;t or wrong, thilk deede or gouernaunce in him silf is vnri&yogh;t and wrong; and so thilk opinioun taken upon the seid habituacioun was take childeli and lewidli.<NOTE PLACE="end"><I>Thus y make an eende of the iij</I><SUP>e</SUP>. <I>parti of this present book.</I></NOTE>

<P>But that this bering an hond upon the clergie and that this blamyng doon to the clergie is vniust and vntrewe, y schal proue in this present iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti bi fyue conclusiouns, of which the first is this: Holi Scripture weerneth not and lettith not the now re|hercid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce. That this conclu|sioun is trewe y proue thus: If eny text of Scripture schulde lette and weerne the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal go|uernaunce, it schulde be oon of these textis whiche schulen now suyngli be tretid in this present chapiter. But so it is, that noon of hem so werneth and lettith, as anoon suyngli schal be schewid. Wherfore Holi Scripture lettith not and werneth not the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce.</P>
<P>A&yogh;ens the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce mai be argued bi textis of Holi Scripture in the Newe Testament, whiche sownen sumwhat (thou&yogh; litle) a&yogh;ens the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. go|uernaunce, 
<PB REF="00000528.tif" N="418"> of whiche textis tweyne ben these. It is writun, Math. xxiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., thus: <I>Nile &yogh;e be clepid maister, for oon is &yogh;oure maystir, and alle &yogh;e ben britheren; and nyle &yogh;e clepe to &yogh;ou a fader on erthe, for oon is &yogh;oure Fader in heuens.</I> Also Iames, iij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.: <I>Nile &yogh;e manye be mad maistris, witing that &yogh;e taken the more doom, for alle we offenden in manye thingis: if eny man not offendith in word, this is a perfit man.</I> Wher of semeth folewe this, that it is for|bodun bi these textis eny man wilne or suffre him silf be clepid maister. But open it is, that noman can take upon him to be in eny state or degre of the seid politik iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce, but if he theryn and therbi take upon him a thing wherbi he is verili and trewli maister to hise netherers; and therfore mai verili, truli, and iustli be clepid maister of hem. Wherfore it is not leeful eny such state, dignite, or degree be in the clergie, sithen it is not leeful eny man be clepid maister.</P>
<P>Answere herto is this: Certis if the arguyng fourmed vpon these ij. now rehercid textis were worth, therbi wolde folewe that it were not leeful eny preesthode to be. Forwhi ech preest is ouer and aboue a deken, as it is open, Acts vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>.; and ech deken is ouer and aboue a lay persoon, euen as a bischop is aboue a preest and an archibischop aboue an other bischop, as it is here aftir open in the next chapiter by Dynys in his epistle to the monk Demophil.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>Domophil,</I> MS.

<P>If the first of tho ij. textis were so streiteli to be vndirstonde, that it were vnleeful eny man be clepid maister, thanne for the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti of thilk same hool text sownyng in lijk wise it schulde be vnleeful eny man to<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>to</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> be clepid fadir, sithen in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. party of the same text it is writun, Math. xxiij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., thus: <I>Nile &yogh;e calle to &yogh;ou fadris vpon erthe, for oon is &yogh;oure Fader which is in heuen.</I> And &yogh;it thera&yogh;ens meetith the wordis of Crist in an other place, Mark, x<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., where he seith thus: <I>Worschipe thou thi fader and thi modir;</I> and Effecies, vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., Poul seith thus: <I>Honoure thou thi fadir and thi modir.</I> How euer wolden Crist and Poul calle persoones fadir and modir to me, but if tho persoones weren verrili fader and modir to me, and but if it were also leeful to me forto calle hem fadir and modir to me, as thei ben verili fadir and modir to me? And so open it is herbi, that the firste parti of the first text, which i<SUP>e</SUP>. parti is this, <I>Nile &yogh;e be clepid maistris,</I> is not to be vnder|stonde so streitly as he sowneth, no more<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>nomore,</I> MS.

<P>The dew vnderstonding of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. text takun into the same obieccioun, whanne it is seid, <I>Nile &yogh;e manye be mad maistris,</I> is this: Iames seiyng and knowing weel that it is hard forto execute perfitli and dewli eny office or state or degre of ouerte, and therfore perilose it is to ful manye that eny of hem be take into such office, state, or degre, (namelich sithen Scrip|ture ther upon, Sapience vj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., seith ful gastfulli thus: <I>Men of power schulen my&yogh;tili suffre tormentis;</I> and sithen also "ech of us alle offenden in ful manye thingis" of lasse hardnes to performe than ben the deedis dew to suche statis or officis, in so myche that no man kan kepe him fro yuel speche and "reule his owne tunge," as Iames seith, and experience it schew|ith, and therfore miche hardir it schulde be<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>be</I> is interlineated in a later hand.

<P>THE ij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusion concernyng and bihold|ing the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce is this: Doom of cleerli disposid resoun in kinde weerneth not and lettith not the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce sett bifore in the bigynnyng of this present iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie. That this conclusioun is trewe, y proue thus: If eny doom of kindeli cleer resoun schulde weerne and lette 
<PB REF="00000538.tif" N="428"> the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce, thilk doom of resoun schulde be oon of these ij. whiche now next suyngli schulen be here rehercid. But so it is, that noon of these ij. doomes of resoun weerneth and lettith. Wher|fore no doom of cleer resoun it lettith and warneth.</P>
<P>Moche synne and harme cometh into the clergie and into the layfe fro and bi the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. politik gouernaunce had and vsid in the clergie: wherfore it is not worthi neither leeful it to be had and vsid. Certis this skile and argument is not worth, as ech man mai soone wite, but if he take withinne him and meene openli or priueli that ech gouernaunce and al thing, fro and bi whiche greet synne and harme comen, is<NOTE PLACE="foot">See p. 337, note.</NOTE> vnleeful and not worthi be had and vsid: for out of this now rehercid sentence or proposicioun the argument muste take his strengthe and proof, if he eny such strengthe schulde haue. But so it is, that this now last rehercid sentence or proposicioun is not trewe. Wherfore the now mad skile and argu|ment is not worth. Forwhi if the argument were worth, thanne bi lijk argument and skile ech gouer|naunce and ech thing fro which and bi which synne and harme comen weren vnleeful and vnworthi to be had and vsid; and so therbi wolde folewe, that forto haue dekenes ouer the lay peple and forto haue preestis ouere dekenys and ouer the lay peple were vnleeful and not worthi be had and vsid; sithen open ynou&yogh; it is, that in the maner in which synne and yuel cometh fro and bi bischophode and popehode synne and yuel cometh fro and bi bischophode and dekenhode, as pride and extorcioun<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>synne</I> . . . <I>extorcioun</I> are added in the margin by a later hand, which has made erasures in the text.</NOTE> and coueitise and ambicioun and symonie and suche othere. And &yogh;it, who euere wole or nyle, Holi Scripture wole that preesthode and 
<PB REF="00000539.tif" N="429"> dekenhode be had and vsid; and therfore the skile assigned for ri&yogh;t doom of resoun, that bischophode and archibischopode and popehode schulden not be, is not ri&yogh;t doom of resoun.</P>
<P>Also if thilk doom were a ri&yogh;t doom of resoun and thilk assigned argument were good, certis bi like skile and bi lijk doom it wolde folewe that it is vnleeful princehode and duchehode and othere statis vndir hem to be, sithen ful myche synne of pride of coueitise, of ravein, of manslau&yogh;ter, of leccherie, of glotenie, of periurie, and manie suche othere synnes comen therbi and therfro, in the maner in which this seid skile and doom takith synne and harme come<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>came,</I> MS.</NOTE> bi and fro the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal politik gouernaunce had and vsid in the clergie. And &yogh;it, who euer wole the contrarie, Holi Scripture approueth weel princehode and duche|hode and othere officis vndir hem to be ouer and aboue the comoun peple, as it is open bi what is bifore alleggid in the i<SUP>e</SUP>. chapiter of this present iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. partie. Wherfore needis it is open, that the seid pre|tendid skile and doom of resoun is no<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>not,</I> MS. (first hand).</NOTE> ri&yogh;t doom of resoun.</P>
<P>Also of and out and bi this, that God made Lucifer so fair an aungel; and of this, that God &yogh;aue to him knouwing of his owne fairnes, came ful miche synne and other harme of greet peyne and losse of good in the now supposid maner of speche; also fro and bi this, that God ordeynede Adam and Eue to not ete of a certein tre in Paradise, came in like maner of speche ful myche synne and othir yuel of peyne and losse of good. And of this, that God &yogh;aue a lawe to the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the</I> is interlineated by a later (?) hand.</NOTE> Iewis, came myche synne, as Poul witnessith, Rom. v<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., seiyng thus: <I>The lawe entrid that gilt schulde

And of this, that Crist chase Iudas to be his disciple came miche synne. And if alle thes deedis and ordinauncis of God weren therfore vnleeful and vnworthi to be doon, God schulde ther yn be accusid of ful greet defaut, &yogh;he, of<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>&yogh;he and of,</I> MS.

<P>What thing or deede is ther in this world tretid and vsid bi men, but that ther of mai come, &yogh;he, and cometh synne and yuel?

And thus miche is ynow&yogh; for vnprouyng of the seid skile pretendid to be good and ri&yogh;t doom of resoun.</P>
<P>Neuertheles here it is vndirstonde, that out and fro and bi a thing or a gouernaunce yuel mai come in ij. wisis. In oon wise, that thilk thing or gouernaunce be cause of the yuel, for as miche as thilk thing or gouernaunce wirchith bi his kinde into the seid yuel: and thanne the yuel cometh out, fro, and bi the seid thing as bi a cause of the same yuel. In an othir wise out, fro, and bi a thing or a gouernaunce yuel mai come, not so that the thing or gouernaunce<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the gouernaunce,</I> MS. (first hand.)</NOTE> 
<PB REF="00000541.tif" N="431"> wirchith or makith bi his kinde eny strecching into the yuel, but that sum othir thing, as the freelnes of a mannys wil vsing and entirmeting with the seid gouernaunce, is the wircher and causer of the yuel whilis he entirmetith with the seid gouernaunce.

And al herfore, for the thing which is the cause of the verry yuel schulde not cause thilk yuel, saue whanne and but if he entermete with the seid gouernaunce. So that the cause of a thing is it that wirchith into the thing, that the thing be mad or doon; and the occa|sioun of a thing is a thing withoute which the cause of the thing wirchith not into the thing, thou&yogh; it in it silf wirchith not into the same thing.</P>
<P>Thanne ferther thus: Thou&yogh; in the ij. now bifore seid dyuerse wisis out, fro, and bi euereither of hem, that is to seie, cause and occasioun, yuel mai be seid come; &yogh;it verili and in propirist and in trewist maner of speking forto speke in this mater, which maner is the first maner now rehercid, the synne and the yuel cometh not fro and bi the seid politik iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouer|naunce had and vsid in the clergie, but fro and bi mannys natural passiouns and freelnessis and fre wil, a&yogh;ens which is not mad sufficient fi&yogh;t and bateil: and fro and bi this as cause, that men for like passiouns and freelnessis not dewli a&yogh;enstondun setten into the state of preesthode, of bischophode, of archibischophode, and of popehode, suche persoones whiche ben not weel proued to be worthi therto, and setten suche persoones as ben vnkunnyng and vnvsid in vertues and suche as ben ouer &yogh;onge, and that for fleischli loue born toward suche persoones and for worldli mede &yogh;ouun for the avauncing of suche persoones.

<P>Also thus: If eny man is aboute forto proue a certein gouernaunce to be vnleeful and not to be had and vsid, by cause that therof in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner cometh synne and other harme, he muste therwith se whether of and bi the same gouernaunce cometh in the first or ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner eny vertuose good and other good or no; and whethir al thilk good so comyng fro and bi the seid gouernaunce be more or lasse than is al the yuel comyng bi the same gouernaunce: and but if he can schewe sureli or miche likeli, that al the now seid good so comyng fro and bi the seid gouernaunce, is lasse than is al the now seid yuel comyng oonli in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner fro and bi the same gouernaunce, ellis his proof can haue no colur.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Probably a clerical error for <I>colour.</I></NOTE> But so it is, that out, fro, and bi the bifore seid politik gouernaunce of ouerte and netherte had and vsid in the clergie cometh in the firste maner and also in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner miche good of vertu, of pees, and of grace, and of blisse, and myche forbarring of synnes, which ellis wolde come forth; as it is open ynow to ech mannys resoun: and no man can make him sure and siker, that fro and bi the seid politik gouernaunce cometh oonli in the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner more yuel than is the good comyng bi the same gouernaunce, and than is the yuel which schulde come fro and bi the noun hauyng of the same seid gouernaunce.

<P>Not withstonding that aftir the trewe speche which in proprist wise ou&yogh;te be here in this mater spokun, that is to seie, in the firste maner, no synne or yuel cometh fro and bi the seid politik iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce, but fro and bi mennys freelnessis, as is now bifore sumwhat declarid; and ful myche good cometh fro and bi the seid politik gouernaunce in trewist and proprist maner of speche bi these wordis "comyng fro and bi:" certis if out, fro, and bi eny gouernaunce cometh nedis synne in the firste maner, that is to seie, if thilk gouernaunce schal needis be cause of synne whanne he is had and vsid, sotheli y can not se but that thilk gouernaunce is vnleeful and not to be had and vsid, how euer miche goostli or worldli good schal come in the first or ij<SUP>e</SUP>. maner bi the same gouernaunce.

And thus myche as here for answere and assoiling to the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng doom of resoun a&yogh;ens the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun concernyng and bi|holding the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce is this: The seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce spokun in the bigynnyng of this present iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. parti is leeful. That this present conclusioun is trewe y proue this: Ech gouernaunce or conuersacioun or policie, which Holi Scripture werneth not and forbedith not, doom of cleer and weel disposid natural resoun weerneth not and forbedith not, mannys lawe weerneth not and forbedith not, is leeful and not worthi be vndirnome and blamed. But so it is, that the now bifore rehercid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. gouernaunce, conuersacioun, and policie vsid in the clergie is not weerned and forbodun bi Holi Scrip|ture, neither bi doom of resoun, neither bi mannys lawe.

The firste premysse of this argument muste needis be grauntid. Forwhi al forbodun thing is forbodun bi Holy Scrip|ture, or by doom of resoun, or bi mannys lawe; for as myche as we kunnen fynde no mo autentik forbeders. But so it is, that al vnleeful thing is forbodun. Wherfore al vnleeful thing is forbodun bi Holi Scrip|ture, or bi doom of resoun, or bi mannys lawe. And thanne ferther thus, al vnleeful thing is forbodun of Holi Scripture, or bi doom of resoun, or by mannys lawe. Wherfore al not forbodun bi Holi Scripture, bi resoun, or bi mannis lawe, is not vnleeful. And so the firste premysse of the principal argument is weel and sufficientli proued.

<P>THE iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal conclusioun concernyng and bi|holding the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce is this: Holi Scripture bothe in the Oold Testament and in the Newe allowith<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>allowith and approueth,</I> MS. first hand).</NOTE> the seid iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce. That this conclusioun is trewe, y may proue bi ij. principal argumentis, of which oon is this: In the Oold Testament God ordeyned oon bischop to be aboue in reule and iurisdiccion to alle the preestis and dekenis, and so to alle the clergie in Goddis chirche being thanne; euen as the pope is now oon persoon aboue in reule and<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>and</I> is interlineated in a later hand.</NOTE> in iurisdiccioun to alle preestis and dekenys and to al the clergie in the chirche of God being now, as it is open.

<P>Which thing thus concludid and proued had and grauntid, it is to be argued ferther therof thus: Peter was heed of the chirche of God in erthe, for ellis the bifore sett wordis of Crist seid to Peter, Iohun i<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., hadden not be trewe.

<P>The firste premysse of this argument is openli ynou&yogh; trewe; and as for treuthe of the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse y make this proof: Neither Seint Dynys neither eny other worthi bischop and reuler, which was maad in the chirche of God bi eny Apostle, wolde haue mad or ordeyned, whilis the Apostlis lyueden, eny gouer|naunce to be had in the chirche of God, but if the Apostlis hadden therto consentid; neither aftir the deeth of the Apostlis, but if thilk makers and ordyners hadden bifore knowe that the Apostlis consentiden it in tyme aftir to be mad and ordeyned,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>ordeyned&emacr;,</I> MS., the stroke above being in a later (?) hand.

<P>But &yogh;it ouer al what in this<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>this</I> is interlineated by a later hand.</NOTE> wise goith bifore, y sette therto this now to be fourmed argument into stable confirmacioun of al it which is now bifore argued bi Scripture into this present purpos: Holi Scripture, i<SUP>e</SUP>. Cor. xj<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>., makith open mensioun that Poul made an ordynaunce to the men of Corinthe, that thei schulde not take her hosil, (that is to seie, the holi eukarist,) at ny&yogh;t tyme aftir her soper, (or in sum other special maner thanne vsid, not now sureli knowen,) forto therbi contirfete Cristis doing at his soper and forto remembre therbi his soper, not withstonding thei hadden vsid thilk maner bi long tyme afore.

Forwhi ellis Seint Poul hadde do amys, which made this now re|hercid lawe and settide it to be had in vce with the comoun lawe of God thanne had and bifore vsid.

Wherfore bi Holi Writt it is open and cleer, that mannys lawis mowen be maad and be sett into vse for to renne with Goddis lawe.</P>
<P>And so fynali and eendli y mai conclude as weel proued, that religiouns and mannys lawis and tradi|ciouns to be mad and be vsid and be set to the comoun lawe of Crist, which is mad of lawe of kinde and of hise sacramentis, is not blameable and reprou|able as for this oonli that thei ben religiouns or mennys lawis and mennys tradiciouns.

<P>The secunde semyng skile into the same purpos is this: Thilk thing or gouernaunce not being necessarie into oure saluacioun, as for that it is the comaunde|ment of God, what euer he be, is to be kutt awey and to be leid aside and to be not had and vsid, of which miche goostli harme and synne comen; for that that he is the occasioun that thilk goostly harme [and synne] comen; forwhi into the meenyng of this now rehercid proposicioun or sentence the Gospel seith thus: <I>If thi ri&yogh;t i&yogh;e or thi ri&yogh;t hond</I><NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>ri&yogh;thond,</I> MS.

<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile is this: If suche now spo|kun lawis and tradiciouns ben gode and profitable to Cristen men, as it is pretendid hem to be, whi or|deyned not Crist tho same lawis and tradiciouns to be had and vsid; sithen he couthe haue ordeyned tho lawis and tradiciouns, as weel as men couthen fynde hem and deuise hem; and sithen he loueth us and wilneth oure goostli profit more than we us silf willen, forwhi for oure goostli good and profite he sore laborid, suffrid, and died? Wher upon it my&yogh;t be argued in forme thus: Crist, which was oure grettist louer and oure beest prower, ordeyned al that was best for us to haue and al that is notabili better to be had than to not be had, for ellis he hadde not be anentis us

<P>Oon is: That Crist blamed ij. tradicions of the Iewis there rehercid; oon bi which it was ordeyned, that a man schulde rather offre vp his money in the temple, than he schulde with the same money releeue his fadir or modir hauyng nede to be releeued therbi, and whiche my&yogh;ten not be releeued saue therbi: an other tradicioun was, bi which it was ordeyned that no man schulde take mete, but that he anoon bifore waischid him, and as soone as eny man were come and turned hoom fro the market or the cheping, that he waische him silf; wherby it is open that the opi|nioun of the Iewis was this, that the bodili waisching with water schulde clense the soule fro moral vnclen|nessis drawun and takun in biyng and silling. Forwhi it nedith not neither folewith, that bi biyng and sil|ling

<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. point is: That Crist blamed there the firste now rehercid tradicioun, for that he was euen a&yogh;ens the commaundement of God, which is the comaunde|ment of lawe of kinde; and he blamed there the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. now rehercid tradicioun, for that he was vein and waast and conteyned an vntrouthe of opinioun, thou&yogh; he were not contrarie to eny comaundement of God.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. point is this: That of and bi thilk ij. long processis of Matheu and of Mark kunne not be had that Crist blamed alle the tradiciouns which Iewis<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the Iewis,</I> MS.

<P>The iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. point is this: That Crist blamed not tho ij. tradiciouns now rehercid for that<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>forthat,</I> MS. (accidentally?)</NOTE> thei weren mennis tradiciouns, but for that thei weren yuel; so that this was not the caus of the blamyng, for that men made tho tradiciouns; but this was al the cause and ground of the blamyng, for that thei weren yuel and badde: and therbi folewith not, that alle othere mennys tra|diciouns not being yuel schulden be worthi be blamed.</P>
<P>Now ferther for answere in special to be mad it is to be seid thus: If Crist hadde there blamed alle tra|diciouns 
<PB REF="00000580.tif" N="470"> of Iewis mad bi hem, or if he hadde blamed the seid ij. tradiciouns for that that thei weren mennys tradiciouns, sotheli thilk ij. long processis, (oon of Ma|theu, an other of Mark) hadden proued weel the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of the principal argument sett bifore in the bigynnyng of the next chapiter. But for as miche as it can not be had bi the ij. processis of Matheu and of Mark, that Crist blamed there alle tradiciouns mad bi the Iewis, saue oonli tho tradiciouns whiche weren a&yogh;ens Goddis comaundement or in eny other wise yuel, neither that he blamed there the ij. there spokun tradiciouns, for that thei weren mennys tradiciouns oonli, saue for that thei weren badde tradiciouns, (as it is open ynou&yogh;, if the wordis of Mark be weel markid and set forto expowne the wordis of Matheu upon the firste there spokun tradicioun)&mdash;therfore it is open ynow, that tho ij. long processis of Matheu and of Mark prouen not it what that thei ben brou&yogh;t forth to proue, that is, the seid ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse. And therfore the seid argument hath not wherbi he mai haue his entent proued. Ferthermore, alle Cristen peple (name|lich, al tho lay persoonys which wolen nedis entermete with reding in the Newe Testament) y biseche for to attende into these thingis or notabilitees,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>natabilitees,</I> MS.</NOTE> whiche y schal now reherce as into thingis ful miche profitable to hem, and whos vnattendaunce hath causid ful myche yuel, namelich in tho lay persoones whiche entermeten miche with reding in the Newe Testament.</P>
<P>The firste ys: That ful ofte oure Lord Iesus for|bedith or weerneth certeyn gouernauncis, and &yogh;it he expressith tho gouernauncis not oonli in the maners and circumstauncis in whiche he hem forbedith and weerneth and in which thei ben forbedable or weern|able, but he expressith hem in a forme comoun to the maners and circumstauncis in whiche thei ben

En|saumple herof is this: Crist weerneth men to clepe to hem a fader upon erthe in sum certeyn maner and forme oonli which is worthi to be<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>be</I> is interlineated in a later hand. Perhaps we should read <I>worthi be weerned.</I></NOTE> weerned, and &yogh;it this thing so as now is seid weerned Crist expressith and outrith in a larger and generaler fourme comoun to the maner and circumstauncis in which it is weern|able and to the maner and circumstauncis in which it is not worthi be weerned. For whi he seith in this large and general fourme, <I>Nile &yogh;e clepe to &yogh;ou a fadir on erthe;</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 9.</NOTE> and therfore this thing so weerned as in general maner of the wordis is to be specified and to be restreyned [and] to be narowid and to be vndirstonde and drawe as it accordith oonli with the maner and circumstauncis in which it is worthi the same thing bi resoun to be forbodun or weerned. And so this that vndir so large and so general a fourme is weerned, <I>Nile &yogh;e clepe to &yogh;ou a fadir on erthe,</I> is to be take and vndirstonde in this wise: "Nile &yogh;e clepe to &yogh;ou a principal or a cheef fadir on erthe, for thilk cheef fadir is in heuen."</P>
<P>And that this notabilite is trewe, it mai be proued thus: For ellis God schulde weerne in oure doable conuersacioun other thing or other wise than resoun 
<PB REF="00000582.tif" N="472"> wolde it schulde be weerned, and so God ther yn were vnresonable; which is not to be grauntid, sithen he comaundith us to be resonable and to be not vnresonable thoru&yogh; al oure moral conuersacioun.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Perhaps Pecock may have Rom. xii. 1-2 in his eye.</NOTE> For if it my&yogh;te be allowid us to bere us vnresonabili, y woot not what lawe schulde lette us fro eny synne.

And therfore this notabilite is trewe. And bi this notabilite is a wey &yogh;ouun forto vndirstonde in ri&yogh;t and iust maner this, that Crist in so general fourme vttrith and expressith, <I>Nile &yogh;e swere alwise;</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 34.</NOTE> and so forth of manye othere forbodis and weernyngis doon toward us vpon oure moral conuersacioun, whiche alle schulen be drawe to be vndirstonde as doom of resoun iugith hem to be vnderstonde, as herof ful rial processis and proofs ben mad in the book clepid <I>Iust apprising of Holi Scripture</I> in ther of the firste partie, and in the firste party of <I>Cristen religioun,</I> the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. trety, bi dyuerse chapitres.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. notabilite is this: That in lijk maner Crist ofte blameth and rehercith as blamable certeyn gouer|nauncis, and &yogh;it he expressith tho gouernauncis not oonli in the maners and circumstauncis in whiche thei ben worthi be blamed, but he expressith hem in a fourme comoun to the maners and circumstancis in which thei ben blame worthi and to the maners and circumstauncis in whiche thei ben not blame worthi; and therfore tho deedis or gouernancis so in general 
<PB REF="00000583.tif" N="473"> or in a comoun and large fourme bi him expressid ben to be vndirstonde and ben to be specified and to be drawe into the maners and circumstauncis in which oonli thei ben bi doom of resoun worthi be blamed.

<P>And &yogh;it ferther the iij<SUP>e</SUP>. notabilite is this: That in lijk maner it is that Crist biddith and counseilith ofte certein deedis and gouernauncis, and &yogh;it he expressith tho deedis and gouernauncis in maners and circum|stauncis oonli in whiche tho deedis and gouernauncis ben comoun and general to be gode and to be badde morali; and therfore tho deedis and gouernauncis ben to be vndirstonde, that Crist biddith or counseilith or willith hem to be doon in the maners and circum|stauncis in which thei ben bi doom of resoun gode oonli. In this maner Crist bade, counseilid, or willed, Luk xij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. thus: <I>Sille &yogh;e the thingis whiche &yogh;e han in possessioun, and &yogh;eue &yogh;e almes.</I> Whether not this is trewe, that summan ou&yogh;te bi doom of resoun and bi the wil of God for to not sille enything which he

Forwhi what euer moral vertu a man wole take and vse, al the while that he is is werking thilk vertu he is therbi lettid, forbarrid, and weerned forto wirche an other moral vertu of Goddis lawe; as, whilis a man is weddid and wole bigete children, he is therbi lettid and weerned to be chaast, and whilis a man wole do almes deedes in Ynglond he is lettid and weerned therbi for to do almesdeedis in Fraunce, and whilis a man rideth in a iorney for a good cause he is therbi lettid and weerned for to heere a preching; &yogh;he, and if the wirching of thilk vertu first takun schulde stonde stille perpetuely, he schulde lette and weerne perpetuely the wirching of the other vertu which my&yogh;te ellis be taken; and so, if the seid premysse were trewe, the vertu which is first takun of a man is euermore vn|leeful.

Wherfore noon of alle these textis berith in him silf eny colour forto smyte or reproue or blame eny sect or religion now had and vsid in the chirche, saue oonli the firste text ij<SUP>e</SUP>. Pet. ij<SUP>e</SUP>. <ABBR EXPAN="capitulum">c</ABBR>. And sithen the sectis of which Peter there prophecied he in tho wordis prophecied, that "sectis of perdicion schulden be denying the Lord which bou&yogh;te hem," no man mai in eny colour afferme that thilk wordis of pro|phecie of Peter fallith vpon the sectis or religiouns now had and vsid in the chirche, but if he afore proue and schewe that these now had and vsid religiouns in the chirche ben sectis of perdicioun and denyen him which bou&yogh;te hem. And therfore proue he firste and bifore that these now seid religiouns ben sectis of perdicioun, and that thei ben denying Crist, and bi|leeuen not into Crist; and thanne lete him haue the maistrie, that Petir in the wordis of his bifore allegid text prophecied or spake of the religiouns now had and vsid in the chirche. And certis open ynou&yogh; it is, that ellis he mai not haue euydence as bi thilk text that Peter meened or thou&yogh;te on hem. Forwhi this folewith not in eny good argument: Petir seide that sectis of perdicioun denying Crist schulden come, therfore these now had religiouns ben tho sectis. A lewder and febler skile or argument can noman make; forwhi bi this argument, if he were au&yogh;t, schulde be proued that ech sect or religioun mad, or which 
<PB REF="00000599.tif" N="489"> my&yogh;te be mad, were or schulde be vnleeful and a sect of perdicioun, how euer good and profitable and leeful he were or schulde be mad; and so the same secte schulde be good and badde, leeful and vnleeful, which is repungnaunce. And therto to this bad argument muste be sett more, if he schulde eny thing proue and conclude, as is forto seie and argue thus: Petir seide that sectis of perdicioun denying Crist schulden come; and so it is, that these religiouns now had and &middot; vsid in the chirche ben sectis of perdicioun denying Crist; therfore of hem spake or meened Petir. Or ellis thus: Of hem is the prophecie of Peter verified and vpon hem fallith thilk prophecie of Petir; and but if the arguer can proue the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of this argument, and eer than he proue thilk ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of this ar|gument, that is to seie, that these now had and vsid religiouns in the chirche ben sectis of perdicioun deny|ing Crist, certis he may not waite aftir that the con|clusioun of this argument be proued or be trewe, that is to seie, that the seid prophecie of Petir fille upon the religiouns now had and vsid in the chirche. And thanne ferther, forto proue that these religiouns ben sectis of perdicioun, he muste take his euydencis and hise motyues in othir place out and fro the seid text of Peter; forwhi it muste be proued that the now had religiouns ben sectis of perdicioun, eer and bifore we wite what and of whom the seid text of Peter meeneth.

<P>And thanne ferthermore thus: Alle the othere textis in the same now seid noumbre speken of persoones tech|ing vntreuli and lyuying viciosely, whether thei lyue in eny religiose sect or out of religiose sect; for of alle suche viciose persoones, whether thei lyuen in sect of religioun or out of sect of religioun, tho textis mowen be verified ri&yogh;t weel, as is open ynou&yogh; bi the general

I aske of thee in lijk wise, "Whi ordeyned not and made not Crist to us who schal be meyr in London in the next &yogh;eer, and who schal be bischop of London aftir the deceesse of the bischop of Londoun now

And thus miche is ynou&yogh; for answere to the questioun askid in thi iij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile and to the argument there maad in forme; forwhi the firste premysse of the argument is to be denyed; and whi he is to be denyed, it is open bi this processe in this answere now maad.</P>
<P>And &yogh;it, (if y schulde ferther seie,) y woot ri&yogh;t weel, that if thou &yogh;auest to thi man hors and sadil, armour and spere, and schuldist bidde him ride into a certeyn feelde, and take to him a prisoner worthi in raunsum of an hundrid pound; and if her with thou my&yogh;tist and schuldist like verili &yogh;eue to him his boldenes, his strengthe, his inward and outward wittis, and his resoun and wil forto reule him in the taking of this prisoner, thou woldist seie that thou &yogh;auest to him this prisoner; for this that thou &yogh;auest to him alle the meenys bi which and with whiche he schulde take this prisoner, not withstonding that he him silf withoute thee takith this prisoner bi and with the meenys and helpis whiche bi caas thou hast &yogh;ouun to him:&mdash;wherfore, sithen God &yogh;eueth to men inward and outward sensytyue wittis and resoun and wil and moving power to make speking and othere bodili movingis and alle othere meenys, wherbi and wherwith men mowen bi hem silf suf|ficientli knowe that suche religiouns ben profitable to hem, and make and ordeyne religiouns now had

<P>In ij. therfore maners God dooth dedis<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>dedis</I> is added by a later hand.</NOTE> in erthe. Oon is of immediat doing, and that is whanne he bi him silf at next withoute meene or his assignee dooth the deede, and thus it is doon whanne he dooth eny myracle aboue the power of creature. An other maner is of mediat doing, and that is whanne he not bi him silf oonli, but bi his assignees dooth it, as bi an aungel or bi the sunne or the moone or sum othir creature; and this dede is doon of God mediatli or with meene; and in this maner he &yogh;eueth to man the ricches which he wynneth bi bisynes of his witt and bi labour of his bodi; and in this maner it is trewe that God made, ordeyned, and &yogh;aue the religiouns whiche now ben had and vsid in the chirche.</P>
<P>Answere to the iiij<SUP>e</SUP>. semyng skile schal be this: Whanne thou askist of me, "Whi ben ther so manye dyuerse religiouns in the chirche, and whi not bi fewer religiouns mai be performed al the good which cometh forth bi so manye religiouns had and vsid in the chirche?" I aske of thee, "Whi in a town which is a thoru&yogh; faar toward Londoun ben so manye ostries clepid innes forto logge gistis, thou&yogh; in fewer of hem alle gestis my&yogh;ten be loggid? Is not this the cause, for that bi the mo dyuersitees whiche schulen be had in the more multitude of ynnes the peple schal be the more prouokid and stirid for to logge hem in tho ynnes, than if ther were fewer ynnes?" Thou muste nedis seie, &yogh;his. Forwhi what point in chaumbring, stabiling, gardeins, beddis, seruicis of the ostiler, (and so in othere thingis) 
<PB REF="00000632.tif" N="522"> plesith oon gist, plesith not an other; and what point in these thingis offendith oon, plesith weel an other; and therfore where that the more such dy|uersyte is had and founde, the more stiring therbi is had to plese manye gistis; and therbi folewingli the mo gistis wolen haue wil forto logge hem in thilk town, more than if ther were fewer dyuersytees, whiche schulde needis be in fewer ynnes. Thanne if this be trewe, and if thou answere to me thus; y an|swere to thee bi lijk skile, that therfore God purueied manye dyuerse religiouns to be in the chirche, for that bi so greet a dyuersite had in so manye reli|giouns (what for dyuersite of outward habit and of inward wering, and of diet, and of waking, and of officiyng, and of sitis, or of placing, and of bilding, and of othere suche manie,) the mo of the peple schulde be prouokid and stirid therbi into religioun, than if ther were fewer religiouns. Forwhi ij. gouer|nauncis ben comounli kept in hem whiche ben moved toward religioun: Oon is, that thei encerchen dili|gentli what pointis and thingis schulden greeue hem, and what pointis schulden plese hem in the place and in the ordre into which thei ben stirid, and what euere pointis thei fynden forto be to hem greuose thei dreden, and what pointis or thingis thei fynden forto be to hem plesaunt thei louen. An other is, that in multitude of men is so greet a dyuersite in affectis and passiouns, that thilk same point or thing which is ple|saunt to oon man is displesaunt to an other man, and what is displesaunt to oon is pleasunt to the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the</I> is added by a later hand.</NOTE> other. Wherfore ther mai not so greet a multitude be weel willi to religioun, if in religioun be litil dyuersite of pointis, as if in religioun be gretter dyuersite of pointis. And gretter dyuersite of suche pointis ben in 
<PB REF="00000633.tif" N="523"> multitude of religiouns, rather than in fewer religiouns. Wherfore needis folewith that by multitude of reli|giouns men schulen be more stirid forto chese and take religioun, than bi fewer. And sithen religiouns ben profitable to Cristen peple, as it is bifore schewid in the [vj<SUP>e</SUP>.]<NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the number.</NOTE> chapiter of this present v<SUP>e</SUP>. parti, it folew|ith that it is profitable such multitude and diversite of religiouns to be, and so that God wolde haue men in the more noumbre and in the more affect be stirid toward religioun forto logge hem ther ynne, sithen it is bifore proued religiouns to be good. Therfore he ordeyned and purveied into thilk entent so manye dyuerse religiouns in the chirche. And &yogh;it herwith weelny&yogh; of ech religioun he ordeyned or purueied to be manye dyuerse housis and placis, as thou&yogh; thei weren dyuerse ostries or herbouris forto logge the more multitude at her liking and plesaunt choise ther yn; and so, thou&yogh; the good of iij. principal vowis be lijke and oon in ech and alle religiouns, &yogh;it the othere plesauntis<NOTE PLACE="foot">Perhaps we should read <I>ple|sauncis.</I></NOTE> and eesis of the religiosis persoones, whiche schulde tolle hem into religioun and whiche also schulde make hem the perfitlier and the stablier per|foorme her othere substancial vowis, ben not like and the same in alle religiouns and neither in alle housis of oon religioun.</P>

And in this maner and for such pretendid and weel proued causis religiose persoones ben licencid forto leue perpetuali her pro|fessid religiouns; as that nunnys han be takun out of her cloistris, and han be weddid to princis; and monkis han be take out of her cloistris, and han be weddid and mad kingis;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>and mad kingis</I> is interlineated in a later hand.</NOTE> namelich whanne therupon hangith ceesing of greet werre and making of greet pees or othere causis like grete weel and surely proued to be trewe; and claustral monkis han be

<P>And so, if alle thingis ben aboute wel considerid longing to the religiouns now vsid in the chirche, noon of hem alle is chalengeable and blameable to be, for that eny point of his fundacioun is meened to be a&yogh;ens the comaundement of lawe of kinde or of Cristis sacramentis, how euer it be with the badde dis|posiciouns and the badde lyuyng of summe persoones in tho religiouns; whos badde lyuyngis is no cause forto therbi proue the religiouns to be badde. For no wey is forto proue that eny of tho religiouns is badde, saue these ij. now bifore tretid; that is to seie, oon, that noon religioun ou&yogh;te be founde bi man forto be sett to the lawe divisid and ordeyned and assigned bi Crist; and the other is, that thou&yogh; it be leeful religioun to be founde and sett to the lawe of Crist, &yogh;it sum statute, rite, or obseruaunce of these religiouns ben a&yogh;ens the comaundement of Cristis lawe maad of lawe of kinde and of sacramentis. And sithen noon of these ij. weies mowe sufficientli be founde in eny of the religiouns now had and vsid, as is now openli and sureli proued, it folewith needis that noon of these religiouns mowe worthili be reproued and blamed to be, that is to seie, as an vnleeful thing.</P>
<P>Neuertheles this is open ynow, that not in alle religiouns the occupaciouns assigned and foundid bi the religioun ben like fruyteful with the occupaciouns of sum other religioun; and also in ech religioun now vsid the occupaciouns foundid and devisid bi the re|ligioun bisidis the thre principal vowis, (that is to seie, of chastite, of wilful and expropriat pouerte, and of obedience to the prelat, whanne he comaundith comaundementis of the religioun,) my&yogh;te be myche amendid, bothe the occupaciouns of her preiyng and officiyng and of her contemplacioun, and also the occu|paciouns

<P>Also in to proof of this present v<SUP>e</SUP>. principal con|clusioun y mai argue bi resoun and experience to gidere thus: Thilk gouernance is worthi be allowid and approued of resoun, which gouernaunce makith manye mo men in Cristendom to be morali vertuose and gode, or forto be myche lasse morali viciose and yuel, than thei schulden be, if thilk gouernaunce were not. But so it is, that religioun is thilk gouernaunce, bi which many hundrid thousind of soulis han lyued ful vertuoseli, which ellis wolden have lyued ful vicioseli; and also bi religioun manye hundrid thousindis han lyued miche lasse vicioseli in religioun, than thei schulden haue lyued, if religion hadde not be. Wher|fore that such religioun be, is alloweable and ap|prouable of ech cleerli in kinde disposid resoun.</P>
<P>The ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of this argument mai be proued thus: Take thou into mynde alle tho men, whiche han be in religioun sithen religioun biganne, and marke thou weel thanne how these men schulden haue lyued, if thei hadden not lyued in religioun; and certis thou schalt not fynde, as weel ny&yogh; for hem alle, that thei schulden haue lyued other wise than as now or than lyuen or lyueden gileful crafti men, or iurouris and questmongers, or pleders for mony, (thou&yogh; the causis of plee be wrong,) or as sowdiers forto fi&yogh;te and slee for spoile and money; &yogh;he, schortli to seie, or forto lyue as we now seen weel ny&yogh; alle worldli peple lyue bothe fleischli and coueitosli and 
<PB REF="00000651.tif" N="541"> vntreuli to God and to man. And bi cause thei han lyued in religioun thei han not lyued so as is now rehercid, but myche better. Wherfore the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. premysse of this present argument is trewe. And thou&yogh; it be so, that in religioun manye men han lyued louceli fro vertu, &yogh;it tho han be fewe in reward of the othere, which han ther yn lyued vertuoseli; &yogh;he, and thei han lyued in religioun more ver|tuoseli or lasse vicioseli, than if thei had lyued out of religioun. And thou&yogh; tho badde lyuers in religioun han lyued ther yn so vicioseli, &yogh;it myche more vi|cioseli thei wolden haue lyued, if thei hadden lyued out of religioun. And therfore, if it be weel and wijsly and treuli aboute considerid, it wole be seen that religioun is a ful noble hegge forto close yn him men and wommen, that tho whiche ben weel disposid schulen be kept from yuel, into which withoute thilk hegge thei schulden falle; and tho whiche ben yuel disposid schulen be kept that thei schulen falle not into so myche yuel, as thei schulden falle, if thei weren withoute hegge. This bifallith ofte and miche and for the more parti in noumbre of hem that lyuen in religioun, thou&yogh; y seie not that it so farith bi alle hem which lyuen in religioun. And herbi it is suf|ficientli proued, that religioun is bi doom of resoun allowable and approuable. And &yogh;it therwith stondith what y haue seid in the extract or outdrau&yogh;t of <I>The Donet,</I> that summe men ben so disposid that thei schulen lyue better out of religioun than in religioun, so that to suche summe persoones religioun schulde be an occasioun of her more goostli harme and hurt.

<P>FERTHERMORE it is to wite, that summe of the lay peple not oonli holden a&yogh;ens the substaunce of the seid religiouns now had and vsid in the chirche; but also thei holden a&yogh;ens the habitis, whiche bi tho religiouns ben assigned to be worn of the religiose persoones.

<P>Also summe of the lay peple blamen and scornen and holden a&yogh;ens this, that bi the religioun of Seint Fraunces the religiose persoones of thilk religion schulen not handle and touche with her hond neither bere aboute hem eny money, that is to seye, eny

<P>And therfore aftir that fro the bigynnyng of the [ix<SUP>e</SUP>.]<NOTE PLACE="foot">A space left in the MS. for the number.</NOTE> chapiter of this present v<SUP>e</SUP>. parti hidir to it is proued and stabilid, that it is leeful ynou&yogh; suche religiouns to be and to renne in vce with the comoun Cristen religioun, y schal now iustifie these here now rehercid thre gouernauncis so vniustli of the lay peple blamed; for y schal expresse and open how that ech of these thre now spokun gouernauncis mai be don and vsid vnder resonable and gode causis. And first into iustifiyng of the firste of these now rehercid gouernauncis, I procede bi iij. principal causis, of which the firste cause is this: Sithen it is sufficientli bifore<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>bifore</I> is added in the margin by a later hand.</NOTE> proued that such seid religiouns be in the chirche, it muste needis therwith [be] resonable, good, and profitable, that the religiose persoones of tho re|ligiouns haue a mark and a signe, wherbi thei mowen openli be knowe fro othere persoones being not in tho religiouns; ri&yogh;t as, sithen the ordris of dekenys and of preestis musten needis be, it is ful resonable and profitable that summe markis be had, wherbi de|kenys mowen openli be knowe fro preestis, and markis wherbi bothe dekenis and preestis mowen openli be knowe fro lay men. But so it is, that this open mark and signe may not be take sufficientli bi her persoones and her natural bodies, sithen her natural bodies ben like to the natural bodies of othere men. Wher fore 
<PB REF="00000655.tif" N="545"> thilk mark muste be take bi her clothing or bi sum mark or signe to be sett and fastned into her clothing. And thanne ferther thus: Sithen the al hool greet clothing is abler to &yogh;eue this now seid knowing, than schulde be eny lasse mark to be sett into the same clothing; it folewith that the al<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>al the,</I> MS. (first hand), the marks of transposition being pro|bably in another hand; but the correction is sanctioned by the analogy of other passages.</NOTE> hool outward seable habit schulde rather be ordeyned into this mark, than eny other lasse thing.</P>
<P>Confirmacioun herto may be this: Not withstonding that wommen mowen be knowe sumwhat fro men bi her natural visagis, &yogh;it it is resonable and profitable that thei be knowe asunder bi her outward habitis. Wherfore miche rather it is resonable, that a religiose persoon be knowe bi outward habit fro othere per|soones not religiose, sithen bi her natural bodies thei mowen not so<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>so</I> is added in a later hand.</NOTE> weel be knowe asundir as mowen be asunder knowe men and wommen. Also it is holde resonable, alloweable, and profitable, that oon temporal lordis meyne haue clothing dyuers fro the clothing of an other temporal lordis meyne; namelich, whanne thei schulen be medlid to gidere in sum oon citee or toun, that the seruauntis of the oon lord mai be knowe fro the seruauntis of the other lord. And in lijk maner in the citee of London it is holde for resonable and profitable, that the persoones of oon craft haue cloth|ing dyuers fro the persoones of an other craft. And al this is for lasse nede or for lasse good cause, than is the cause for whiche religiose persoones schulden be knowen openly fro persoones not religiose. Wherfore it is alloweable, good, resonable,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>good, resonable,</I> is added in the margin by a later hand.</NOTE> and profitable, that religiose persoones haue habit dyuers fro the habit of 
<PB REF="00000656.tif" N="546"> othere persoones not religiose. And if this be trewe, certis resonable and alloweable it is, that the habit of oon such religioun be dyuers fro the habit of an other such religioun; and that ech such religioun haue to him his propre assigned habit, namelich, sithen it is alloweable that multitude of suche religiouns be had and vsid in the chirche, as it is bifore in this v<SUP>e</SUP>. parti sufficientli proued.</P>
<P>The secunde cause into the iustifiyng of this same firste gouernaunce is this: Sithen it is so, that suche religiouns ben alloweable, (as it is bifore sufficientli proued),<NOTE PLACE="foot">The first lines of this paragraph (as far as <I>proued</I>) occur twice over in the MS.; the first attempt being full of mistakes is cancelled.</NOTE> it is alloweable and ful resonable and pro|fitable, that the religiose persoones in tho religiouns haue ofte in her si&yogh;t or feeling and therbi ofte in her mynde rememoratijf<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>remembratijf,</I> MS. originally, but the correction may have been made by the original scribe. As the form occurs twice below unaltered it has been retained in the text, but it is exceedingly suspicious.</NOTE> signes forto ofte and myche therbi be remembrid upon the chargis of the religioun, whiche thei han taken upon hem to kepe and ful|fille; ri&yogh;t as for such cause God wolde that the comoun peple of the Iewis schulde haue the comaunde|mentis of Moyses tablis writun in the wallis of her chambris biholding a&yogh;ens her beddis, and in the wallis of her hallis biholding a&yogh;ens her mete table. But so it is, that no more conuenient, redier, and ofter seen and feelid remembratijf signe into this seid purpos for re|ligiose persoones couthe be founde and assigned, than her outward habit. Wherfore it is resonable, allowe|able, and profitable, that her outward habit be mad to hem into such for hem a remembring signe forto hem remembre ofte and myche into the chargis of her religioun taken upon hem. And thus my&yogh;te not her habit be to hem such a remembring signe, but 
<PB REF="00000657.tif" N="547"> if it were dyuers fro the habit of othere persoones not religiose; neither the outward habit of oon religioun my&yogh;te so perfitli and so sufficientli move and remem|bre into the al hool charge of his religioun, if it were not sum what dyuers fro the outward habit of an other religioun, as it may, if it be sum what dyuers. Wherfore it is resonable, alloweable, and profitable for cause of remembring, that religiose persoones haue outward habitis dyuerse fro the outward habitis of lay men, and that the persoones of oon religioun haue her outward habit dyuers fro the outward habit of persoones in an other religion.</P>
<P>Also the outward habitis of religiose persoones mowen be remembratijf signes to the lay peple not religiose forto remembre hem silf therbi thus: Lo, these persoones thus clothid han forsake the greet en|termeting with the world and the greet felicite and prosperite of the world for the greet ioie, reward, and mede, which thei therfore abiden to haue in heuen; it is good therfore to us forto do in the same wise, or in sum other wise lijk<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>or in sum other wise lijk</I> is added in a later hand, and partly written on an erasure.</NOTE> good to us or more, ac|cording to oure abilte. Wherfore it muste needis be, that also into the remembring of persoones not being religiose as of persoones being religiose, it is allowe|able and profitable that religiose persoones haue ha|bitis propre to her religiouns.</P>
<P>The iij<SUP>e</SUP>. cause into iustifiyng of this same firste gouernance is this: Sithen suche religiouns ben al|loweable to be, (as it is bifore sufficientli proued,) and alle men bi her natural freelnes ben redi and prompte into gaynes of aray and into dyuerse fynd|ingis of schap in aray for vein glorie and for othere not gode causis, it is resonable, alloweable, and pro|fitable, 
<PB REF="00000658.tif" N="548"> if sum remedie be devisid, take, and vsid, wherbi refreinyng and lett mai be mad to this perel now rehercid. But so it is, that for to dyuyse, take, and vse stabili oon schap of outward habit, (namelich such a schap which is rather foul than gay, and which schulde rather lette fro glorie than tice into glorie,) and for to dyvise, take, and vse stabili oon colour of clooth in outward habit is a ful noble re|medie and a refreynyng a&yogh;ens the seid natural freel|nes, bi whiche religiose persoones my&yogh;ten and wolden ellis breke forth into nyce fyndingis of dyuerse schappis in her outward aray and into gay and riche blasing colour, and so ther yn synne bi manye wijsis.

But so it is, that no re|ligioun now had in the chirche now weerneth hise persoones forto purueie into suche bilding with the costis of the religioun and with the concent of the couent: as that this is trewe, the reulis of the same religiouns mowen be clepid into iugement.

Wherfore it semeth folewe, that tho goodis &yogh;ouun into religiouns bi lordis and ladies and the lou&yogh;er peple ou&yogh;ten not be expendid in to bilding and reparing of suche seid lordli dwellingis.</P>

<PB REF="00000665.tif" N="555"> to be forborn, it is preiseable forto forbere the ny&yogh;ing and the homeli cumpeniyng with hir; and in lijk maner, for that Adam and Eue ou&yogh;ten haue forborne the eting of the appil in Paradise, it hadde be good and preiseable if thei hadden forborn the entermeting which thei maden aboute the appil in it biholding, handling, taasting, ymagynyng, and questiouns ther|aboute moving. But so it is, that loue to money (and namelich greet loue to money) is worthi to be forborn, as experience weel schewith, for that it is moder of passing myche yuel, and, as Poul seith, it is "the roote of al yuel,"<NOTE PLACE="foot">See 1 Tim. vi. 10.</NOTE> and it is "seruice of ydol|atrie,"<NOTE PLACE="foot">See Ephes. v. 5.</NOTE> and the touching and handling and bering of it is a greet nei&yogh;ing and entermeting and a ful greet homelines therwith making. Wherfore it folewith that it is preiseable forto forbere the bare touching and handling of money, that bi this forbering sumwhat the more the seid ouer greet loue to money be lettid forto gendre or to growe or to contynue;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>to contynue,</I> MS.

But so it is, that freris of Seint Frauncessis religion ben bounde bi the reli|gioun forto forbere the ouer miche loue<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>loue</I> is interlineated in a later hand.</NOTE> to money: and herwith it is trewe, that the forbering<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>for bering,</I> MS.

<PB REF="00000667.tif" N="557"></P>
<P>To the firste of thes now mad obiecciouns and chalengis y may answere thus: For to handle or bere money is a more homely entermeting with the same money, than is forto telle it with a stik; and therfore the more homelynes is forborn, and the lasse homelynes is suffrid. To the ij<SUP>e</SUP>. obieccioun and chalenge y mai answere thus: Iewelis ben not in so manye kindis so redy and so ni&yogh;e to the vce in which the hauer mai delite him synfulli, as is money. Forwhi the hauer of iewelis may not delite him silf with iewelis fleischli neither worldli except veinglorioseli,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>vein glorioseli,</I> MS.</NOTE> eer than he haue turnede or chaungid the iewelis into money; and so into ful many synful vsis the money is ny&yogh;er and redier than ben iewelis; and therfore the more perel is forborn, whilis the lasse is suffrid to abide. And thou&yogh; it were so, that the telling of money with a stik were as greet a nei&yogh;ing in homelynes to money as is bare handling, and thou&yogh; the handling of iewelis were as perilose as is the handling of money; &yogh;it ther of not folewith, that if eny man for deuocioun wolde forbere the oon, that therfore he ou&yogh;te forbere the other; neither it were chalengeable, if he wolde forbere the oon and wolde not forbere the other. Forwhi it is fair, good, and preisable to forbere the oon, whilis he is not con|streyned to forbere of hem bothe eny oon; and it is preisable him to binde him silf in to the forbering of the oon, whilis othere men bynden not hem silf to of the same bothe eny oon. And in lijk maner y seie, thou&yogh; the forbering of mony tellyng with a stik were as good a remembrauncing meene in to the bifore seid effect, as is the forbering of money tellyng with bare hond; and thou&yogh; the forbering of iewelis touch|ing were as good a remembring meene into the

And thus y answere to the ij. now bifore going obiecciouns or chalengis.</P>
<P>Confirmaciouns to this answere mowen be mad ful weel bi ensaumplis thus: If a man wole for a iust cause faste ech Friday in the &yogh;eer as bi boond and not as bi fre deuocioun oonli, were this a iust chalenge thera&yogh;ens for to seie thus, "Whi fastith not he ther with also bi boond the Saturday or the Wednesday?"

Open ynow it is, that these chalengis weren not resonable. For bettir it is forto do oon good of the tweyne, into of whiche neuer neither he is bounde, than forto leue of hem the euereither vndoon. Ferthermore if eny man wolde chalenge a frere of Seint Frauncessis ordre, and seie to him thus, "Frere, thou louest money as myche as othere men<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>men</I> is added in the margin by a later hand.</NOTE> louen, and more than othere men louen; for ellis thou woldist not so bisili begge for to haue it: whi wolt not thou thanne handle money as othere men handlen?" the frere my&yogh;te weel answer thus, "Sir, if y loue money more than othere men louen, and more than y schulde loue; 
<PB REF="00000669.tif" N="559"> &yogh;it if ne were this forbering fro touche of money, y schulde loue money more than y loue now; and therfore this forbering fro touche is not in vein.

And if the chalenger wole contynue in his chalenging and seie thus, "It is better and more toward perfec|cioun for to not loue the money ouer myche, than forto absteyne fro touching it:" the frere my&yogh;te graunte it weel, and my&yogh;te seie setting therto this, "And for that the forbering of handling money is a good meene into the abstinence of louyng it, therfore y absteyne fro handling it; for that y wolde therbi come the sooner into the not louyng of it as into the better good, than is the not handling of it." And &yogh;it if<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>if</I> is added in the margin by a later hand.</NOTE> the chalenger wolde stryue ferther and seie thus, "Frere, it is bettir and neerer to perfec|cioun forto not loue money ouer myche and handle it, than forto not loue money and not handle it; and sithen the gretter perfeccioun or the thing neerer to perfeccioun is to be chosun, rather than the lasse perfeccioun or the thing romber fro per|feccioun, thou schuldist rather sette thee forto not loue money with the handling of money, than for to sette thee and wone thee to not loue money with the not handling of money:" herto the frere my&yogh;te answere thus, "Sir, y knouleche weel that it is better and hi&yogh;er gode and holynes forto not loue money with touching it, than to not loue money with the not touching of it; but a&yogh;enward to freel men, whiche han not &yogh;it gete the fulnes of perfeccioun, it is surer to not loue money with not

And therfore to me, (as man freel bi kinde and not hardi for to feele of my silf that y am in the fulnes of perfeccioun,) it is surer for to chese this parti which is for to not loue money with the not handling of it, than for to not loue money with the handling of it. And whanne &yogh;e seien ferther thus, that the more good and the perfi&yogh;ter good and the hi&yogh;er good and the neerer good to perfeccioun is alwey of ech man to be chose and executid bifore other lasse good and romber good fro perfeccioun, certis this is not trewe; for thou&yogh; ech man ou&yogh;te loue and desire such now seid gretter good bifore the lasse good, &yogh;it not ech man ou&yogh;te chese forto do and execute such more good bifore the lasse gode, but perfit men at fulle<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>the fulle,</I> MS.

<P>A&yogh;ens this now rehercid mys bering of tho men and a&yogh;ens this her foul faring with hem silf and her vniust bering an hond is maad a book bi him silf clepid <I>The book of feith</I> and an other <I>Of sacramentis;</I> and also ij. othere bokis, of whiche oon is clepid <I>The book of baptym,</I> the other <I>The book of eukarist,</I> in which book sufficientli and cleerli al this now re|hercid foule and mys bering and vniust chalenging and blamyng is reproued and vnproued. And ther|fore, sithen so long a werk is seid and doon there, it is no nede forto seie ther of eny thing vnperfitli and vnfully and therfore vnsauorili here; lest perauenture for the lak and the noun hauyng at hond here of al that ou&yogh;te be seid to gidere for strengthing of the treuthe, enemyes my&yogh;ten and wolden take colour that her parti is not so miche confoundid as it is, and that the contrarie partie to hem is not so weel proued as it is.</P>
<P>The x<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce a&yogh;ens which summe of the comoun peple erren is this: That the clergie in certein causis and maters swerith and makith othere persoones forto swere, and allowith weel that princis and her officers being vndir hem bothe swere and make othere men of the layfe forto swere.

<P>The xj<SUP>e</SUP>. principal gouernaunce, a&yogh;ens which summe of the lay peple erren, is vsid in the lay partie and not in the clergie and is this: That men for her trespacis ben doon into her deeth.
