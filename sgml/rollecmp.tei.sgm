   <EDITORIALDECL><P>This companion volume to <TITLE>The English Prose Works of Richard Rolle</TITLE> contains material from Carl Horstman's <TITLE>Yorkshire Writers: Richard Rolle of Hampole, An English Father of the Church, and His Followers</TITLE> (2 vols., London: Swan Sonnenschein, 1895-6) not currently regarded as part of the Rolle canon.  For this volume, Horstman's organization has largely been preserved.  The texts are grouped by MS at the div1 level (with two exceptions; see below), and presented in the order given by Horstman: Rawlinson C 285, Harley 1022, Cambridge Dd.V.55, and the Lincoln Thornton MS from <TITLE>Yorkshire Writers</TITLE>, vol. 1, and de Worde's early pseudo-Rolle editions, pieces from the Vernon MS, and a miscellaneous category, "Works Wrongly Attributed to R. Rolle," from vol. 2.  (The pb element indicates volume as well as page number for Horstman's edition throughout.)  Normally, individual texts are given at the div2 level; where Horstman prints variants from other MSS, each MS reading is given at the div3 level (base MS first, then variant[s]).  The source for each is marked with head tags and also appears as the value of the "n" attribute.  The genuine, or arguably genuine, Rolle material has been silently excised from this volume, as have all pieces in verse or Latin prose (Latin quotations and lines of poetry contained within English prose works are retained).  The material in Horstman's appendices to vol. 1, from MSS Thornton and Arundel 507, is also omitted.  As a result, gaps in Horstman's pagination are frequent.</P><P>Horstman's presentation has required a greater degree of editorial tinkering in the case of certain texts included in the Thornton MS section.  A lengthy passage from the Thornton copy of <TITLE>The Mirror of St. Edmund</TITLE> does not appear in the Vernon MS copy, and is marked here with seg tags (Horstman indicates the beginning and end of this passage with a large X).  As the Thornton copy of Walter Hilton's <TITLE>On the Mixed Life</TITLE> is deficient at the beginning, the Vernon copy is treated as the base text, with the Thornton following.  Additional opening and closing material from the printed editions, which Horstman prints concurrently with the opening and closing sections of the Vernon copy (1: 264-6, 292), has here been consolidated at the div3 level, and follows the Thornton text.  The policy of excising material possibly by Rolle from the present volume has been suspended in the case of the Thornton text of <TITLE>The Abbey of the Holy Ghost</TITLE>.  This work, given in the Rolle volume, is also reproduced here because Horstman prints its companion piece, <TITLE>The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost</TITLE> (definitely not by Rolle and so not included in the Rolle volume), as a continuation of <TITLE>The Abbey</TITLE>; however, as <TITLE>The Charter</TITLE> is absent from Thornton, he gives the text from Laud misc. 210.  In order to preserve Horstman's organization and to avoid the inelegance of including in the Thornton section a freestanding text from a different MS, <TITLE>Abbey</TITLE> and <TITLE>Charter</TITLE> are given here as divisions at the div3 level of a single text.  Horstman prints some additional English prose from the Thornton MS in an appendix (1: 377-9, 383-92); this is not included in the present volume.</P><P>The section Horstman designates "Early Editions of Works of R. Rolle" is here renamed "De Worde's Early Editions, Attributed to Rolle," in order to make clear the basis for relegating these texts to the companion volume.  Note that this section does not parallel the single-MS sections in that each edition occupies the div2 level, each text within it the div3.</P><P>The concluding section, "Works Wrongly Attributed to R. Rolle," comprises various pieces which were attributed to Rolle by Horstman's predecessors or contemporaries, or which bear Rolle's name in MS.  They are drawn from miscellaneous MSS otherwise unrepresented in <TITLE>Yorkshire Writers</TITLE>: Harley 1706, Royal 17.A.xxv, Rawlinson C 894, and Univ. Coll. Oxford 97.  The Rolle canon Horstman sought to rectify by assembling material under this rubric is by now so obsolete as to make the grouping seem rather arbitrary, but the category is still useful as a repository of leftover material.</P><P>Horstman regularly inserts bracketed (sometimes parenthetical) corrections in his text without indicating a source for the emendations.  It often appears that he is simply reconstructing what he takes, on no specific textual authority, to be the original reading.  His brackets and parentheses are here retained as data.  When a source is identified (e.g., when a  lacuna is filled from a different MS), the added text is enclosed in supplied tags, with the source given as the value of the "n" attribute.  Horstman also occasionally records his surprise at certain MS readings with an interjected (!), again retained as data.</P><P>Note as well the following differences between Horstman's printed text and the present edition: 1) Horstman's sections devoted to MSS Cambridge Dd.V.64 (1: 3-82) and Arundel 507 (1: 132-56) are omitted entirely, as all the English prose appearing in them is given in the Rolle volume.  2) To avoid confusion, the titles of individual works are given as they appear in the <TITLE>Manual of Writings in Middle English, 1050-1500</TITLE> (Ed. J. Burke Severs and Albert E. Hartung, New Haven, CT: Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1993).  Horstman's headings have been retained for pieces not specifically referred to in the Manual.  However, as the excision of certain pieces disrupts Horstman's practice of numbering consecutively each text he prints from a given MS, the numbers have been eliminated; texts identified by number alone have been given names derived from their incipits or opening lines.  3) Obsolete MS designations and shelf-marks have been updated.  4) Expansions marked with italics in Horstman's text are given silently in the present edition; Horstman's introduction, textual notes and other editorial commentary have been omitted.  New notes have been inserted when necessary to clarify relationships between texts, to identify sources, or to provide other useful information.</P><P>In addition to the English prose contents of the first appendix to vol. 1, the following texts have inadvertently evaded inclusion in the present volume: the <TITLE>Twelve Profits of Tribulation</TITLE>, the sermon <TITLE>"Of the Double Coming of Christ"</TITLE> and the brief <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Epistola ad simplices sacerdotes"</FOREIGN> from Royal 17.B.xvii (2: 45-63); and the prose version of <TITLE>The Gast of Gy</TITLE> in the Vernon MS, given by Horstman as a companion to the metrical version in Cotton Tiberius E.vii (2: 292-333).</P></EDITORIALDECL>

For qwyles Iudas had comyn wylle, na man did he dere: bot qwen hys wille

<P>AMonge all creatures that euer god of his endeles myght made / was there none &thorn;at he so loued as he dyd mankynde / whom he made [to reioyce] euerlastynge blysse in stede of aungels / whiche dyd fal from blysse downe in to helle. But that good god loued so man / that for as moche as man had forfeyted that blysse thorugh synne of Adam / he of his plenteuous charyte became man / to bye body and soule that was lost.  In what maner he bought vs / euery crysten man knoweth or sholde knowe: / that no lasse pryce / but suffred his owne precyous body to be all to-rente with bytter paynes of scorgynge.  He suffred also a garlonde of sharpe thornes pressyd to his heed / whiche percyd so the veynes that the blood ran doune in to his eyen / nose / mouth &amp; eeres.  Afterwarde vpon the crosse his bones were drawe out of Ioynte / the veynes &amp; the senewes were borsten for strayte drawynge / to &thorn;e crosse he was nayled honde &amp; foot / and so fayled the blood of kynd with bytter paynes of deth.  He betoke his spyryte to the fader of heuen / and than suffred at the last his gloryous herte to be thorugh-percyd with a sharpe spere for to gyue his herte-blood to bye man body and soule into Ioye without ende.  &para; Yf god of his grete goodnes loued thus man, gyuynge hym ouer this wytte and reason and all other thynge that hym nedeth: / kyndely a man sholde nyght and daye with all his wyttes loue hym, and feruentely desyre to conne loue suche a good god that all thynge made, all thynge gyueth and susteyneth.

<HEAD> B &para; How men somtyme loued god / &amp; how holy men somtyme were vysyted with swetenes in the loue of almyghty god.</HEAD>
<P>I Fynde &amp; rede of oure holy faders in olde tyme that for the loue of god they forsoke the worlde and all worldely thynges and lyued in wyldernes by grasse &amp; by rotes / suche men were feruent in the loue of god.  But I trowe there ben but fewe or elles none that folowen them now / for we fynde not by goddes lawe or heste that we sholde l[y]ue so.  For all-be-it they were kepte &amp; susteyned so moost by the myght and grace of god / as no goodnes may be without hym: yet I trowe they lyued so moche by &thorn;e strength of kynde that was in man tho dayes.  I wyll not counseyll the to lyue as they dyde / for thou mayst by other maner lyuynge come to the loue of god / as thou shalt se afterwarde.  &para; I fynde also furthermore of other ful holy men of ryght late tyme whiche lyueden a ful holy lyfe, and toke theyr lyuelode as feblenesse of man asketh now in our dayes.  Some of these men as I haue herde and redde were vysyted by the grace of god with a passynge swetenes of the loue of cryste / whiche swetenes for an example they shewed afterwarde by theyr wrytynge to other men folowynge / yf ony wolde trauayle to haue that hyghe desyre or degree of loue.  This loue whiche they haue wryten to other is departed in thre degrees of loue / whiche thre degrees they hadden one after an other, standynge stablysshed in theyr desyre / and suffrynge pacyently for the loue of god many trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons tyll they come by holy contemplacyon to &thorn;e hyghest degre of loue of tho thre.  By this I suppose he that hath grace to come to the fyrst may by goddes helpe come to the seconde / &amp; so with a feruent desyre &amp; good perseueraunce he may come to the thyrde.  Shortely I wyll shewe here these degrees of loue / for [percase] all men and women that sholde rede this haue not knowynge of theym / ne neuer herde speke of suche degrees of loue before-tyme.     &para; Degrees of hyghe loue.     .I.  &para; The fyrste loue is so feruent that no-thynge whiche is contrary to goddes wyll may ouercome that loue / welth ne wo, helthe ne sykenes; Also he &thorn;at hath this loue wyl not make god ones angry for all the worlde withoute ende / but rather suffre all the payne that myght come to ony creature than ones wylfully dysplease his god in thought or [in] dede. .II.  &para; The seconde loue is more feruent, for &thorn;at is so stronge / that what man loueth in that degre, all his thought, herte &amp; myght is so entyerly, so besely &amp; so perfyghtly stablysshed in Ihesu cryste that his thought cometh neuer from hym


<PB N="2: 75">

but [only] whan he slepeth.     .III.  &para; The thyrde degre of loue is hyghest and moost wonderfull / for what man cometh to that loue / all comforte and all solace is closed oute of his herte / but onely the Ioye of Ihesu cryste / Other Ioye may his herte not receyue, for swetnesse that he hath of the Ioye euermore lastynge.  This loue is so brennynge &amp; so gladynge that who so hath that loue may as well fele the fyer of brennynge loue in his soule / as an other man may fele his fynger brenne in erthely fyre.  This loue may well be called a brennynge loue.     And yf men had suche swetnesse in the loue of god of so late tyme, I suppose wel &thorn;at &thorn;e same we may haue now by the gyfte of god yf we were as feruent in loue as they were.  But these degrees of loue ben set vpon so hyghe loue to god / that what man sholde haue the fyrst of these thre / behoued that he were a sad contemplatyf man or woman, And by cause mankynde is now &amp; euermore the lenger the febler or perauenture more vnstable / therfore vnethes sholde we fynde now a sad contemplatyfe man or woman.  Men of relygyon haue taken dyuerse habytes of contemplatyf lyfe; Men &amp; women also that ben enclosed, as it semeth lyuen a contemplatyfe lyfe / &amp; so with goddes grace they do for the more partye: But for to speke of hyghe contemplatyfe lyfe as holy men lyued before this tyme, it semeth there ben ryght fewe.  Therfore I trowe that I may sykerly say that fewe there ben now that wyl or may trauayle now to haue suche hyghe degrees of loue as I haue reherced before.  Neuertheles what so euer thou be that redest or herest this / be neuer [&thorn;e] slower to trauayll. For yf thy desyre be sette feruently &amp; lowly, holdynge the vnworthy to haue so hyghe a ghoostly gyfte before an other man / &amp; puttest thy desyre to goddes dysposycyon trustyngly, he wyll dyspose that is best for the / whether thou haste thy desyre or haue it not.  But it is fyrst nedefull to &thorn;e that thou haue other thre degrees of loue that the same holy men wrote in theyr treatyse / whiche be not of so hyghe a degree as tho that be reherced before.     .I.  &para; The fyrst degree of these is / whan a man or a woman holdeth the commaundementes of god &amp; kepeth hym-selfe out of dedely synne / &amp; is stable in the fayth of holy chyrche.  Also whan a man wolde not for none erthely thynge dysplease god / but truly standeth in his degree whether he be religyous or seculer.  In this maner euery man behoueth to loue his god that wyll be saued: / therfore I counseyll the to haue &amp; kepe this loue or thou clymbe to ony hyer degree. .II.  &para; The seconde degree is whan a man forsaketh all the worlde for the loue of god / that is for to saye his fader, his moder &amp; all his kynred, &amp; foloweth cryst in pouerte.  Also studieth nyght &amp; daye / how clene he may be in herte, howe chaste in body / how meke &amp; buxom / howe clene in all vertues / &amp; hate all vyces / soo that all his lyfe be ghoostly &amp; none thynge flesshely.     .III.  &para; The thyrde degree is hyghest / for that is a ful contemplatyfe lyfe, as whan a man or a woman loueth for to be alone from all maner noyse.  And whan that he is saddely sette in this lyfe and in this loue, with his ghoostly eyen than may he se in to the blysse of heuen; And than his eyen be soo enlumyned and so clere lyghted with grace of ghoostly loue, and also thrugh-kyndeled with the gracyous fyre of crystes loue, that he shall haue a maner of brennynge loue in

his herte euermore lastynge, and his thought euermore vpwarde to god.  &para; Thus as I haue reherced god hath vysyted his seruauntes, gyuynge theym a specyall sauour to loue hym by theyr holy lyuynge.  Many other men and women there be whiche please god full well standynge truely in theyr degree as men &amp; women of the worlde / both lordes &amp; ladyes &amp; other husbonde men women &amp; wyues. For al be it they may not come to suche hye contemplatyfe lyfe, it suffyseth [to] them to haue the fyrst degree of these thre whiche I reherced last / for that euery man is bounde to kepe.  &para; &para; Yf thou desyre to haue an hygher degre of loue in to the worshyp of god / trauayle as other men dyde &amp; aske helpe and grace with good perseueraunce / yf it please god to performe thy wyll &amp; brynge the to thy purpose.  But for as moche as there be many that haue not a sadde grounde ne but lytell felynge how they sholde loue and drede god / whiche is spedefull &amp; nedefull for all men to knowe: Therfore to suche as be not knowynge I wyll shewe fyrste in what maner they sholde loue &amp; drede god / that they may be &thorn;e more stable in the loue of god.  After that I shall shewe by the grace of god foure degrees of loue / whiche euery crysten man relygyous &amp; seculer sholde holde and kepe, &amp; may performe for the more partye yf his wyll be feruently set to the loue of god.  &para; Now than as I sayd I shall in the begynnynge with the helpe of god wryte &amp; shewe somwhat of the drede of god / that shal be to his worshyp, &amp; proufyte to the reder.</P></DIV3><DIV3
TYPE="section">
<HEAD> C &para; What is drede / and how a man sholde drede god.</HEAD>
<P>I Rede that &thorn;e drede of god is begynnynge of wysedom.  &para; Drede, as clerkes haue wryten before this tyme, is in many maners.  But I suppose thre kyndes of drede ben moost nedefull for to knowe.  The fyrst is drede of man or drede of the worlde.  The seconde is called drede of seruage.  The thyrde is called a chaste drede or a frendely drede.     .I.  &para; The fyrst whiche is drede of man or of the worlde is / whan a man or woman dredeth more the punysshynge of the worlde, as betynge the body or prysonynge, than the punysshynge of the soule; Also whan a man dredeth more to lese his temporall goodes in this passynge worlde than to lese the blysse without ende.  / this drede is counted for nought / for god almyghty forbad this drede whan he sayd thus: Dredeth hym not that may slee &thorn;e body / but rather drede hym that may sende the body &amp; soule in to euerlastynge fyre.     .II.  &para; And the seconde drede whiche is the drede of seruage / is whan a man withdraweth hym or absteyneth hym fro synne / more for drede of the payne of helle than for loue that he sholde haue to god. Euery suche man what goodnes he doth it is not for drede to lese euerlastynge blysse whiche he desyred not / but for drede onely of suffrynge of grete paynes whiche he dreded sore.  this drede suffyseth not as thou shalt see afterwarde / but yet it may be good &amp; proufytable.     .III.  &para; The thyrde drede whiche is called a chaste or a frendely drede is / whan a man dredeth the longe abydynge here for grete desyre that he hath to be with god; Also whan he dredeth that god wyll go fro hym / as peraduenture he withdraweth his grace fro hym; Also whan he dredeth to dysplease god for the grete loue &amp; desyre &thorn;at he hath for to please god.  / suche drede cometh of loue &amp; that pleaseth moche god.  Take


<PB N="2: 77">

than hede how here be reherced thre maner degrees of drede: / fle the fyrst for it is not proufytable.  The seconde may be proufytable / for some men there be whiche drede god by cause they sholde not be sente into hell to brenne there with the deuyls in euerlastynge fyre.  This drede may be good, for by this waye they may come in to the loue of our lorde god, as by this waye that I shall shewe.  All be it that thou drede our lorde god onely for payne, yet louest thou not god whome &thorn;ou dredest / thou desyrest not yet goodnes of vertues / but thou withstandest &thorn;e wyckednes of vyces / whan thou withstandest the wyckednes thou begynnest to desyre goodnes.  Whan thou desyrest goodenes &amp; vertues / than cometh in to the the thyrde maner of drede / whiche is called as I sayd a chast or a frendely drede.  For than thou dredest to lese the goodnes &amp; grace that god hath put in &thorn;e / thou dredest than also to lese the blysse that is ordeyned for the / &amp; so by this thou shalt drede god that he forsake not the / whan thou dredest god in this maner thenne hast thou hym sykerly with the / &amp; so for his loue thou shalt desyre to be with hym.  Thus mayst thou well knowe how drede of god may brynge the in to the loue of god / yf thou loue god than thou hast wysedom / so thus the drede of god is the begynnynge of wysedom. Take hede than and drede god in the maner as I haue reherced / for yf thou drede wel god thou shalt not be slowe in his seruyce.  He that dredeth well god leueth no goodnes vndo whiche he may do to the pleasure of god.  Yf thou drede god thou wilt kepe his commaundementes / and the drede that thou hast to god shall brynge the in to euerlastynge sykernes where &thorn;ou shalt neuer drede. Of the drede of god wexeth a grete deuocyon and a maner sorowe with full contrycion for [thy] synnes / thrugh that deuocion and contrycion thou forsakest thy synnes / and perauenture somwhat of thy worldely goodes.  By that forsakynge thou lowest the to thy god &amp; comest in to mekenes / thorugh mekenes thy flesshely lustes ben destroyed / by &thorn;at destruccion all vyces be put out &amp; vanysshed awaye /by puttynge out of vyces than vertues begyn to wexe and sprynge.  Of the shynynge of vertues the clennes of the herte is purchased.  By clennesse of thy herte thou shalte come to full possessyon of the holy loue of Cryst.  By these wordes thou mayst knowe howe &thorn;ou shalte drede for loue / &amp; how thou mayst come to loue thrugh drede of god.  But the more [&thorn;at] loue encreaceth in the / the more drede gooth from the / so that yf thou haue grace to come to a feruent loue thou shalt but lytell thynke on drede for the swetnesse that thou shalt haue in the loue of god.  but yet be thou neuer so parfyte it is nedefull that thou drede discretely as longe as thou art in this worlde.  [And] for as moche as I sayd thou mayst come to loue yf thou drede god / see now furthermore what is charyte &amp; loue to god, How &amp; in what maner thou shalt loue hym / why thou shalt loue hym, How &thorn;ou shalt knowe whan god of his mercy graunteth the that grace to conne loue hym.</P></DIV3><DIV3

bour as our-selfe for god.  And these be two pryncypall commaundementes of god.  The fyrst longeth to &thorn;e loue of god / whiche is &thorn;e gretest commaundement of &thorn;e lawe of god; The seconde longeth to &thorn;e loue of thy neyghbour and this is lyke to the fyrst; / &amp; thus thou hast what is charyte and loue.  &para; See now how thou shalt loue god. / thou shalt loue god with all thy herte / all thy soule / &amp; with all vertue, as thus.  Whan &thorn;ou puttest away from the or withstandest with all thy power all thynge that is pleasynge or lykynge to thy flesshe for the loue of &thorn;e blessyd flesshe of cryste / than thou louest hym with al thy herte &amp; al thy soule.  Of this mater thou shalt her more afterwarde; / but se now ferthermore [why] thou shalt loue hym.  &para; The causes why thou shalt loue god ben without nombre hauynge rewarde to his benefaytes / but two causes we haue pryncypally aboue other.  One is for he loue[d] vs fyrst with all his herte and al his soule swetely &amp; strongely.  Swetely whan he toke flesshe &amp; blood &amp; became man for oure loue.  Strongly whan he suffred deth for loue of man.  The seconde cause is / for ther is no thynge that may be loued more ryghtfully ne more proufytable.  More ryghtfull is there none than the loue of hym that made man and deyed for man.  More proufytable thynge is there none that may be loued than almyghty god / for yf we loue hym as we be bounde / he wyll gyue vs Ioye and blysse without ende / where no thynge lacketh but all thynge is plenteuous and euerlastynge.  &para; Se now how thou shalt knowe whan god putteth grace in the for to knowe loue.  Whan the trauayle whiche thou hast for the loue of god is lyght &amp; lykynge to the / than thou begynnest to haue sauour in the loue of god.  For ther is no maner trauayle greuous ne trauaylous to hym &thorn;at loueth god feruently &amp; trauayleth wylfully for the loue of god.  &para; Also stedfast loue feleth no bytternesse / but all swetenesse / for ryght as bytternesse is syster to the vyce of hatred / right so swetnesse is syster to &thorn;e vertue of loue, so that in loue is all swetnesse.  &para; Also the trauayle of louers may be in no maner trauaylous ne greuous.  For ryght as hawkers &amp; hunters what euer trauayle they haue it greueth them not for the loue &amp; lykynge that they haue in theyr game / ryghth so what thynge it be that a man loueth &amp; taketh vpon hym a trauayle for that thynge that he loueth, [either] it is no trauayle [to hym] / [or elles] yf it be trauaylous it lyketh hym to haue trauayle for &thorn;at thynge whiche he loueth.  Take than good hede of these wordes / for yf thou loue god thou wylt gladly trauayle &amp; suffre for &thorn;e loue of god; yf thy trauayle semeth than lyght to the / or ellys yf thou louest or desyrest gladly to haue trauayle for the loue of god thou mayst wel knowe that god of his grace hath put in the a begynnynge to come to loue.  Whan thou hast suche a gracyous begynnynge withdrawe not &thorn;at loue from hym for no maner dysease that may fall to the.  For many men &amp; women there be that whyle they be in prosperyte / that is to say / whyle they be in welth &amp; in rest, gladly they wyll shewe loue to god suche as they can:  But yf god sendeth hym ony dysease or ony maner of chastysynge, anone her loue swageth; &amp; that is no sadde loue.  For who so loueth trustyngly &amp; sadly he loueth as well in his aduersyte as in prosperyte / for what god sendeth to vs it is for our proufyte / therfore be it helth be it wo &thorn;at he sendeth we sholde hertely thanke hym &

not withdrawe our loue from hym; for no nede that he hath to our loue / but for grete profyte that we sholde haue to loue hym / &amp; for his grete goodnes that he wyll chastyse vs here all for our better.</P><P>Thus than haue I shewed in fewe wordes what is charyte &amp; loue to thy god / howe thou shalt loue hym / why thou shalt loue hym / and how thou shalt knowe whan thou hast grace to conne loue hym.

</P><P>FOure degrees of loue there be / the fyrst is called an ordeyned loue or els ordynat loue / that is to saye a loue ordeyned to be knowen and kept of all maner men &amp; women of euery degree in the worlde.  To this degree of loue longen .v. poyntes to be kepte.  The fyrst is thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned.  The .II. is that thou loue the worlde to no superfluyte. The .III. is that thou loue thy neyghbour for god.  The .IIII. is that thou loue thy frende for his good lyuynge.  The .v. is to loue thyn enemye for the more mede of god.</P>
</DIV3><DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>E  &para; The fyrst is that thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned.</HEAD>
<P>THe fyrste poynte is as I sayd: thou shalt loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned, as thus.  Thou shalt take mete &amp; drynke, clothynge and al other thynge that is nedefull to thy body / in resonable maner, to kepe thy body in his estate, in comforte of thy soule, to trauayle &amp; contynue in the seruyce of god / &amp; not for to nourysshe thy flesshe in lust &amp; lykynge with dyuerse [&] delycate metes &amp; drynkes / for ther-of cometh foule stynkynge synne &amp; many bodyly sykenes / namely whan ther is to moche excesse.  This wytnesseth an holy clerke &amp; sayth / they that delyted them in lustes of the flesshe they haue ful often many dyseases in theyr flesshe.  &para; Also as I rede a soule that is wonte to delytes of the flesshe gadreth togyder many fylthes and wyckednes.  Thou mayst also do no exces / for yf thou vse the to excesse / thou fallest in to the vyce of glotonye / whiche [as] thou knowest well is dedely synne.  Of &thorn;at synne I rede thus: / where &thorn;e vyce


<PB N="2: 80">

of glotony reygneth in ony man he leseth &thorn;e ghoostly strength yf he had ony before; And but yf the wombe of glotonye be swaged all his vertues ben cast downe.  / therfore loue thy flesshe to [his] sustentacyon &amp; not to delytes &amp; to excesse / for here thou mayst well knowe &amp; se that it is good &amp; nedefull to flee delycacyes. But thou shalt vnderstande here &thorn;at I counseylle the not to forbere ony mete or drynke in specyall / for the vyce of delycacye is not in the mete / but in &thorn;e lust that thou hast in mete; / therfore sayth an holy clerke: Often we take deynte metes without blame / &amp; somtyme other metes and comyn to euery man not without gylte of conscyence.  So thus it semeth wel whan we take ony mete for delyte more than for sustenaunce we offende god / therfore flee delytes &amp; lustes of mete &amp; drynke and loue thy flesshe onely that it be susteyned / &amp; than thou hast the fyrst poynte of this degree of loue.</P></DIV3><DIV3
TYPE="section"> <HEAD>F  &para; The seconde is thou shalt loue the worlde to no superfluyte.</HEAD>
 <P>THe seconde poynte is thou shalt loue the worlde to no superfluyte.  As thus: Yf thou loue god thou shalt not desyre ne loue vanytees of the worlde / ne worldely goodes more than &thorn;e nedeth.  Yf god hath ordeyned the to an hyghe degree in the worlde / as for to be a lorde or a lady / or for to haue ony soueraynte ghoostly or worldely / by reason reuerence must be done to the more than to an other man or woman.  For after that the fyrst man Adam was inobedyent to goddes commaundement it was ordeyned by almyghty god that man sholde be subgect to man; Also for as moche as &thorn;e people must [nedes] haue gouernaunce / therfore it is reason to do reuerence to them that haue power &amp; gouernaunce aboue other.  But all be it &thorn;at &thorn;ou be grete &amp; worldely worshyp must be do to the / loue it not ne desyre it not but mekely yelde all &thorn;at worshyp to god whiche myght haue made the a subget there he hath ordeyned the a lorde or a souerayne / &amp; thrugh that lownes thou shalt haue some grace to withstande &thorn;e desyre of worldely vanytees.  I say[d]e ferthermore / yf thou loue the world to none superfluyte / &thorn;ou shalt not desyre ne loue worldely good more than the nedeth.  As thus: thou knowest well ynough in thy begynnynge whether thou art lord or subgect / poore or ryche / holde the apayde with thy degree so that thou haue thy sustenaunce / &amp; desyre to be no greter / but onely as goddes wyll is &amp; as he wyll dyspose for the.  Yf thou holde the not payde with that that god hath sente to the and to thyn a resonable lyuelode / but euer desyrest for to be greter and greter in the worlde, than thou louest the worlde to superfluyte for thou desyrest more than thou nedest, &amp; soo by that foule desyre thou fallest in to the vyce of couetyse whiche is repreued by [al] goddes lawe as a foule dedely synne.  This synne is full peryllous / for I rede where that the synne of couetyse is in a man, &thorn;at man is made subgect to all other vyces.  I fynde also that couetyse and pryde be as it were one vyce or one wyckednes / in so moche that yet where pryde reygneth there is couetyse / &amp; where couetyse reygneth there is pryde.  / this vyce is so wycked &amp; so greuous [&thorn;at] as longe as it reygneth in ony man he shal haue no grace for to drawe to god-warde.  This wytnesseth well a full holy clerke saynt Gregorye &amp; sayth thus in an Omelye: That in none other wyse we may ne can neuer come ne drawe to &thorn;e begynner &amp; maker of


<PB N="2: 81">

all goodnes / but that we caste awaye frome vs the synne of couetyse whiche is rote of all euylles.  Than it semeth well, yf thou wylt come to the loue of god thou must flee the synne of couetyse.  &para; Thre thynges there be in the worlde as I rede whiche men desyre aboue all other worldely thynges.  The fyrst is rychesse.  The seconde is lustes.  And &thorn;e thyrde is worshyp.  Of rychesse cometh wycked dedes.  Of lustes cometh foule dedes.  And of worshyp cometh vanytees. Ryches engendreth couetyse; lustes noryssheth glotonye &amp; lecherye / &amp; worshyp noryssheth boost &amp; pryde.  Thus thou mayst knowe what peryll it is to loue the worlde.  [Therfor yf thou wylt stande sikerly, loue not the worlde] more than nede is / &amp; than thou shalt kepe the seconde poynte of this degree [of loue]</P>

<HEAD> G &para; The thyrde is thou shalt loue thy neyghboure for god.</HEAD>
 <P>THe thyrde poynte is howe thou shalt loue thy neyghboure for god / to this thou arte bounde by the commaundement of god where he commaundeth &amp; sayth / thou shalt loue thy neyghboure as thy-selfe; / yf thou shalt loue hym as thy-selfe nedes thou must loue hym.  / thou shalt loue hym also for god.  Of this loue speketh saynt Austyn &amp; sayth / thou shalt loue god for hym-selfe with all thy herte / &amp; thy neyghboure for god as thy-selfe / that is to saye / loke where-to and for what thou louest thy-selfe so thou shalt loue thy neyghboure.  Thou shalt loue thy-selfe in all goodnesse &amp; for god / ryght so thou sha[l]t loue thy neyghboure for god &amp; in all goodnes, but in none euyll.  / therfore sayth the same clerke: He that loueth men &thorn;at is to saye his neyghbours, he loueth or sholde loue them for they ben good &amp; ryghtfull or els that they may be good &amp; ryghtfull / &amp; that is to saye thou shalt loue them in god or els for god / &amp; in this maner euery man sholde loue hymselfe.  Also of the loue of thy neyghbour I rede, whan thou forsakest a synguler prouffyte for &thorn;e loue of thy neyghbour than &thorn;ou louest thy neyghbour.  Also thou louest thy neyghbour as thy-selfe whan thou doost hym no harme but desyrest the same goodnes &amp; prouffyte ghoostly &amp; bodely to hym that &thorn;ou desyrest to thy-selfe.  Loue thus thy neyghbour or els &thorn;ou louest not god.  To this accordeth an holy clerke &amp; sayth: By the loue of god the loue of thy neyghbour is purchased / &amp; by &thorn;e loue of thy neyghbour the loue of god is nourysshed / for he &thorn;at taketh no hede to loue his neyghbour he can not loue his god.  But whan thou hast fyrste sauour in [&thorn;e] loue of thy neyghbour / than thou begynnest to entre in to &thorn;e loue of god.

For as I rede parfyte frendshyp is whan thou louest not in thy frende &thorn;at sholde not be loued / and whan thou louest in hym or desyrest to hym goodnes whiche is to be loued.

<PB N="2: 82">

As thus: though it be so &thorn;at thy frende lyueth folysshly thou shalt not loue hym [for his] foly lyuynge but that he may by goddes grace amende hym and be parfyte in lyuynge.

<P>THe fyfth poynte is thou shalt loue thyn ennemye for the more mede.  A grete dede of charyte it is &amp; medeful to forgyue them &thorn;at haue trespaced ayenst vs, with all our herte.  &para; It is but lytell goodnes &amp; full lesse mede to be wel wyllynge to hym that doth the no harme / but it is a grete goodnes &amp; a greter mede that thou be well louynge to thyn ennemye, And &thorn;at thou do good &amp; wyll good with all thy power to hym that doth euyll or is in wyll to do euyll to the with all his power.  Of this mater speketh an holy clerke and sayth: It is holden a grete vertue amonge worldely men to suffre pacyently theyr ennemyes / but it is a greter vertue a man to loue his enemye / for that vertue is presented as for sacrefyce before the syght of almyghty god.  Also to this purpose accorden the wordes of cryst where he sayd to his dyscyples: Loue your ennemyes / do good to theym that hate you / &amp; praye for them &thorn;at pursyewe you to dysease / &amp; for them &thorn;at despyse you, that [&yogh;]e may be the chyldren of the fader in heuen. Loue than thyn enemye for &thorn;e more mede yf &thorn;ou wylt kepe &thorn;e fyfth poynt of this fyrst degree of loue.  &mdash; &para; Shortly thus ben declared to the the fyue poyntes of &thorn;e fyrst degree of loue.  In the fyrste, yf thou take good hede, thou art warned and counseyled for the loue of god / and as thou art bounde by all crysten lawes / to withstande the synne of glotonye &amp; al other flesshely lustes.  In the seconde poynte to withstande &thorn;e foule vyce of couetyse, pryde &amp; all other vanytees of the worlde.  In the thre last poyntes to loue thy neyghbour, thy frende &amp; all other men for the loue of god and for the more mede.  Loue than god in this fyrst maner of loue / and thou shalt thrugh his grete grace yf thou wylt come to the seconde degree of loue.
</P><P>THe seconde degree of loue is called a clene loue.  Yf thou wylt come to this seconde degre of loue thou must kepe thre poyntes.  The fyrste is / &thorn;at thou loue no vyce with vertue.  The seconde is &thorn;at thou despyse all euyll custome. The thyrde is that thou sette not lytell by synne whether it be lytell or grete.</P></DIV3><DIV3
TYPE="section">
<HEAD> K &para; The fyrste poynte is thou shalt loue no vyce with vertue.</HEAD>
<P>THe fyrst poynte is / thou shalt loue no vyce with vertue.  As thus: what euer thou be in mannes syght / be ware that thou be not vycyous Inwarde in thy soule vnder colour of vertues whiche &thorn;ou shewest openly.  Our ghoostly ennemye &thorn;e fende hath many subtyltees to dysceyue mankynde, But amonge all this is a grete dysceyte / whan that he maketh a vyce lyke to vertue, &amp; vertue


<PB N="2: 83">

lyke to vyce.  This thou mayst see by ensample.  For all be it that mercy is a grete vertue where &thorn;at it is kepte in &thorn;e worshyp &amp; in &thorn;e name of god, yet it is vycyous where it is do in worshyp of man &amp; not of god.  Also [the] vertue of ryghtwysnes is tourned in to vyce / whan it is do for worldely couetyse or els for anger or inpacyence.  The vyce also of pryde is hyd somtyme vnder mekenesse, As whan a man loweth &amp; meketh hymself in speche and in berynge to be holde meke &amp; lowely.  Pacyence also semeth in many a man whan there is none: As whan a man wolde take vengeaunce yf he myght for the wronge that is do to hym / but for he may not / or els he hath no tyme to wreke hym on his enemye / for that cause he suffreth, &amp; not for the loue of god.  By these ensamples &amp; many other thou mayst well knowe that vyces somtyme be lyke to vertues.  To this accordeth saynt Iherom &amp; sayth thus: A grete &amp; an hyghe connynge it is to knowe vyces &amp; vertues, for all be it that vyces &amp; vertues be contraryous / yet they be so lyke that vnnethe the vertue may be knowe from the vyce / ne &thorn;e vyce fro the vertue.  Be ware therfore &amp; loue so sadly vertues without ony faynynge that &thorn;ou hate all maner vyces / and so &thorn;ou mayst kepe the fyrst poynte of this degree of loue.</P></DIV3><DIV3
TYPE="section">
<HEAD> L &para; The seconde is &thorn;ou shalt hate all euyll customes.</HEAD>
<P>THe seconde poynt is thou shalt despyse all euyl customes.  A grete peryll it is to haue an euyll dede in custome.  For as I rede / synnes be they neuer so grete ne so horryble / whan they be drawe in to custome they seme but lytell to theym that vse suche synne in custome / in so moche that it is to them a grete lykynge to tell and shewe theyr wyckednes to al other men without ony shame.  Of this &amp; suche vsage speketh an other holy clerke &amp; sayth: Whan synne cometh so in vse that the herte hath a lust &amp; a lykynge ther-in / that synne shall ful fayntly be withstande.  For whan a synne is brought in to custome it byndeth sore the herte &amp; maketh the soule bowe to hym, that it may not ryse agayne &amp; come in to the ryght waye of clene lyfe; For whan he is in wyll to ryse / anone he slydeth &amp; falleth agayne.  For this sayth the same clerke in an other place: Many there be &thorn;at desyren to come out of synne / but for as moche as they ben closed in the pryson of euyll custome they may not come out from theyr wycked lyuynge.  &para; Also to this purpose I rede that he &thorn;at vseth hym not to vertue[s] in his yonge age he shal not conne withstande vyces in his olde age.  Thus &thorn;ou mayst well se &thorn;at yf thou be vsed in ony synne it wyll be full harde to withstande it.  And but thou leue all maner synne to thy power &thorn;ou hast none clene loue to thy god / therfore withstande all maner synne &amp; take none in custome / than &thorn;ou shalt kepe the seconde poynt of this degree of loue.</P></DIV3><DIV3

set not lytell there-by.  For as I rede what man &thorn;at passeth mesure in takynge of his lyuelode as often more than hym nedeth that man offendeth god / this semeth to many men full lytell trespas:  But this holy man saynt Austyn sayth: It is no lytell synne for as moche as we trespas euery daye there-in for the more partye; In as moche as we synne therin euery day we synne therin often / &amp; by that we multeplye our synnes &amp; that is full peryllous / therfore it is full nedeful to drede al suche venyall synnes &amp; sette not lytell by theym.  Also venyall synnes be they neuer so lytell / they be moche to be dradde.  As the same clerke sheweth by ensample of lytell bestes where they be many to-gyder / be they neuer so lytell yet they slee &amp; do moche harme; Also &thorn;e granes of sande be full lytell / but yet where a shyp is ouer-charged with sande it must nedes synke or drenche.  Ryght so it fareth by the synnes; be they neuer so lytell they be full peryllous.  For but yf a man be [&thorn;e] rather ware &amp; put theym awaye they shall make hym forto synne deedly.  Therfore yf thou wylt haue a clene loue to god / charge in thy conscyence euery synne lytell &amp; grete &amp; withstand in the begynnynge &amp; put it out as soone as god wyll gyue to the grace, with contrycyon, confessyon &amp; som almesdedes.  And than thou shalt kepe the thyrde poynte of this degree of loue.  &mdash; Here is reherced the mater of these poyntes.  &para; Thus ben declared the thre poyntes of the seconde degre of loue.

An holy desyre it is to desyre the presence of almyghty god for the grete loue that thou haste to god.  Suche an holy desyre is soo acceptable to god as I rede / that what man hathe a grete desyre, all be it he speke not with the tonge / he cryeth full loude with the tonge of his herte; And [he] that not desyreth, how euer he loueth to our syght outwarde / or speketh to our herynge, he loueth not in his hert &amp; as a dombe man he is to-fore god whiche may not be herde.  Of suche holy desyre I rede also,


<PB N="2: 85">

the lenger that loue lacketh whiche is so sore desyred &thorn;e more feruent is his desyre whiche abydeth, &amp; that desyre begynneth to brenne thorugh strength of &thorn;at desyrynge loue / in so moche that though the body or the flesshe fayle &thorn;at desyre is nourysshed &amp; encreaced.  To this accordeth saynt Gregorye &amp; sayth / holy desyres wexen &amp; encreasen in taryenge &amp; abydynge / for where desyres fayle in abydynge there is no sad desyre.

<P>THe seconde poynte is: what euer thou do thynke vpon the worshyp &amp; drede of god.  If thou kepe this thou shalt the more sykerly lyue to goddes pleasure. For what dede thou art in wyll to perfourme in worshyp of god, thou mayst be syker of grete mede.  Also yf thou drede god, thou art aferde for to do ony thynge that sholde be dyspleasynge to hym / &amp; for as moche as &thorn;ou dredest thou doost it not; Soo by that drede thou leuest that thynge vndo whiche shold tourne the in to grete peryll of thy soule yf it had ben perfourmed in dede.  By this thou mayst wel knowe that it is full spedfull to thynke in &thorn;e begynnynge of all thy werkes vpon the worshyp &amp; drede of god.  To this accordeth the techynge of saynt Paule where he sayth thus:  What euer ye do in worde or in dede / do it in the name of our lorde Ihesu cryst.  For he that begynneth all thynge in &thorn;e name of almyghty god he begynneth in the worshyp of god.

Yf thou synne vpon trust of ony goodnes wylfully thou synnest, so in &thorn;at &thorn;ou louest not stedfastly.  &para; To this purpose I rede also that he is full vnkynde that is full of vertues &amp; dredeth not god.  Also a grete folye &amp; a grete pryde it is for to synne vpon trust of ony good dedes.  For be thou neuer so full of vertues or goodnes / vnkyndnes to thy god may destroye all tho vertues.  More vnkyndenes mayst thou not shewe than dysplease god wylfully / whiche is begynner and gyuer of all goodnes; be ware therfore &amp; flee suche vnkyndnes / &amp; do no synne vpon trust of other good dedes.  Of suche vnkyndenesse also it is nedefull for to be ware for the more acceptable [that] thou art to god thorugh thy good lyuynge / &thorn;e more culpable shalt thou be yf that thou fall agayne in to synne and in to euyll lyuynge. &para; And of this thou hast ensample of Adam.  For as moche as he was fulfylled fyrst with goodnes / therfore his trespas was moche the more whan that he fell in to synne.  &para; Also I rede &thorn;at it is but a sclyder hope where a man synneth vpon trust for to be saued / for he that so doth he neyther loueth ne dredeth god, And but yf that we loue and drede god to our connynge or knowynge we

may not be saued / therfore it is more spedefull for to drede well than to trust amys.  Also it is more prouffytable a man to holde hymselfe lowe &amp; feble than to desyre to be holden stronge / and for feblenes to fal and be lost.  Take hede than what goodnes that god putteth in the and thanke hym mekely &amp; praye hym of contynuaunce / &amp; doo no synne vp trust of other good dedes.

<P>THe fourth poynt is thou shalt rule the so dyscretly that thou fayle not [for] to feruent wyll.  To kepe this it is nedefull to the to haue the vertue of discrecyon; as thus:  Yf thou take for &thorn;e loue of god so moche abstynence, wakynge or other bodely penaunce &thorn;at thou mayst not for feblenes contynue to trauayle in &thorn;e seruyce of god / than is thy wyll to feruent:  For be thy loue neuer so grete god is not pleased whan &thorn;ou rulest &thorn;e in suche maner that thou mayst not abyde in his seruyce thrugh thy mysrule.

<HEAD>S &para; How by encreace of vertues thou mayste come to parfeccyon.</HEAD>
<P>THe fourth degree of loue is called a parfyte loue.  An other loue there is all be it I make noo mencyon but of foure / whiche is called moost parfyte loue. Of that loue speketh saynt Austyn &amp; sayth:  Charyte is parfyte in some men &amp; inparfyte in some men, But &thorn;at charyte that is moost parfyte may not be had


<PB N="2: 88">

here whyle we lyue in this worlde.  Of the same moost parfyte loue speketh the same clerke thus:  In the fulfyllynge of the countre of charyte / that is to saye / in fulfyllynge of heuen where that all is loue and charyte, This commaundement of god shall be fulfylled where he sayth / &THORN;ou shalt loue thy lorde god with al thy herte / with all thy mynde / and with all thy soule; For whyle ony flesshely desyre is in man god may not be loued with all the herte and full mynde. And by this thou mayst knowe that there is a passynge loue whiche may not be fulfylled in this worlde / and that may well be called moost parfyte loue.  But here perauenture some man wyll aske / why it is commaunde[d] / but it myght be performed in this worlde?  To that the same clerke answereth and sayth / that it is skylfull that suche a perfeccyon sholde be commaunded / and this he sheweth by ensample in this wyse.  Ryght as no man may renne euen and sykerly but he knowe whether he shall renne, In the same maner noo man sholde knowe [t]his moost parfyte loue / but it hadde be shewed in the commaundementes of god; Yf noo man hadde knowen it no man wolde haue laboured hym to come therto.  &para; Now sythen it is so we knowe [well that we so must loue, it is nedeful we] sette vs in a redy waye, whyle we be here, that wyll brynge vs euen to that moost parfyte loue.  A more syker waye is there none in this worlde than the waye of parfyte loue.  Wherfore I counsell the to haue this fourth degree of loue whiche is called a parfyte loue, that [thou] may come the more sykerly to [&thorn;e most] parfyte loue.     &para; Of parfyte loue speketh Saynt Austyn and sayth:  He that is redy to deye gladly for his brother, in hym is parfyte loue.  To this acordeth the wordes of Cryste where he sayth:  No man hath more charyte in this worlde than he that putteth his soule for his frendes / that is to saye than he that gyueth gladly his lyfe for the loue of god to wynne his frendes soule.  This loue is the gretest loue in this worlde / &amp; many there be, I trowe, thrugh the gyfte of god that haue this parfyte loue; but yf it thynke the harde to come to suche an hyghe loue / be therfore not agast.  For other parfyte loue there is wherin thou mayst loue parfytly thy god / as I fynde by the techynge of an holy clerke where he counseylleth in this wyse:  &para; Yelde we vs to god of whome we be made / and suffre we not theym to haue the maystrye ouer vs whiche ben not of so grete value as we be / but rather haue we &thorn;e maystrye ouer theym; As thus / lete reason haue the maystrye ouer vyces / lete the body be subgect to the soule and lete the soule be subgect to god / &amp; than is all &thorn;e parfeccyon of man fulfylled.  Thus we sholde lyue by reason as &thorn;e same clerke sheweth by ensample. / For as we put lyuely thynges before them &thorn;at be not lyuely, Also as we put wytty thynges before them that haue no wytte ne reason, Also ryght as we putte tho that ben not dedely before theym that ben deedly / ryght so yf we wyl lyue parfytly we must putte proufytable thynges before theym that ben lusty and lykynge, Also put them that ben honest before theym that ben proufytable, Also putte theym that ben holy before them that ben honest, And put all thynges that ben parfyte before them that ben holy.  Take hede than of this / for yf thou wylt lyue after this techynge than thou mayst lyue parfytely / yf thou lyue parfytely &thorn;ou sha[l]t loue parfytely; lyue than thus &amp; thou


<PB N="2: 89">

shalt come to parfyte loue.     But for as moche as it is full harde to come sodaynly to suche a parfyte loue / therfore take hede to tho thre degrees of loue whiche ben reherced before / &amp; begynne to lyue sadly in the fyrste / &amp; than from &thorn;e fyrst clymbe vp to the seconde / &amp; fro the seconde to the thyrde / &amp; yf thou be sadly stabled vpon the thyrde thou shalt lyghtely come to &thorn;e fourth where is all perfeccyon / yf thou haue perfeccyon thou shalt l[o]ue perfytely.  Begyn than at the fyrst degree of loue / &amp; so encreace in loue &amp; vertues yf thou wylt come to this degree of parfyte loue.  &para; I rede that some men begynne to be vertuous / som encreace in vertues / and some be parfyte in vertues.  Ryght so it fareth by the loue of god; as soone as thou art in wyll &amp; begynnest to loue god / that loue is not yet parfyte but thou must stande fast &amp; nourysshe &thorn;at wyll / &amp; yf it be well nourysshed it wyll wexe stronge / &amp; yf it hath full strength than it is parfyte.  &para; To this purpose I rede also that no man may be sodaynly in so hyghe a degree / but euery man that lyueth in good conuersacion / whiche may not be without loue / they must begynne at the lowest degree yf they wyll come to an hyghe parfeccyon.  Thus than, good brother or syster whether thou be, withstande all vyces / and gadre to the vertues for the loue of god, and encreace in them tyll they ben parfytely stabled in the.  And amonge all vertues loke that thou haue a feruent wyll / be besye [in] deuout prayers / stande strongely ayenst temptacyons / be pacyent in trybulacyons / &amp; stable in perseueraunce, that thou lyue parfytely &amp; so come to parfyte loue.  Take none hede of them that set lytell by parfeccyon / as of them that saye &thorn;at they kepe not to be parfyte / it suffyseth to them to be lest in heuen / or come within the yates of heuen; these be many mennes wordes &amp; they be peryllous wordes.  For I warne &thorn;e forsothe what man hath not parfyte loue here he shall be purged with paynes of purgatorye / or ellys with dedes of mercy performed for hym in this worlde / and so be made parfyte / or he come to heuen blysse / for thyder may noman come but he be perfyte.  Beware therfore of suche lyght &amp; foly wordes, &amp; trust more to thyn owne good dedes whyle &thorn;ou art in this worlde than to thy frendes whan thou art deed. / Thynke also this lyfe is but short, &thorn;e payne[s] of purgatory passe all the paynes of the world, the paynes of hell is euerlastynge / &amp; the Ioye &amp; blysse of sayntes is euermore durynge.  Thynke also ryght as god is full of mercy &amp; pyte, ryght so he is ryghtfull in his domes.  Yf thou wylt thynke on these wordes ofte, I trust to the mercy of god thou shalt waxe [so] stronge in vertues &amp; withstande so vyces &thorn;at within a short tyme thou shalt come to a parfyte loue.  Whan god hath so vysyted the that thou can loue hym parfytely than shal all thy wyll &amp; all thy desyre be for to come to &thorn;at loue whiche is moost parfyte / that is to saye euermore to se almyghty god in his gloryous godhede, euermore with hym to dwelle.  But for as moche as we may not come to our desyre / but we begynne somwhat to loue hym here in this lyfe:  Therfore almyghty god mercyfull thorugh the besechynge of his blessyd moder Marye graunte vs grace so to loue hym here / &thorn;at we may come to the Ioyfull &amp; euerlastynge lyfe / where is moost parfyte loue, &amp; blysse without ende.  Amen. &para; Here is reherced shortly how by encreace of vertues thou mayst come to parfeccyon &amp; what vertues thou shalt loue.</P>

<PB N="2: 90">
<P>IN this fourth degree of loue / whiche is called a parfyte loue / thou art taught and counseylled to begynne at a lowe degree yf &thorn;ou desyre to haue an hygh degree, as thus:  Yf thou wylt haue this fourth degree of loue thou must begynne at the fyrst, &amp; so encreace in vertues tyll thou come to parfeccyon.  But amonge all vertues &amp; al other poyntes whiche ben reherced before / fyue poyntes there be as me thynketh spedefull &amp; nedefull euery man to haue &amp; kepe &thorn;at ony good dede shall begynne &amp; brynge to good ende.  The fyrste is &thorn;at thou haue a feruent wyll.  The seconde is that thou be besy in deuoute prayers.  The thyrde is &thorn;at thou fyght strongely ayenst all temptacyons.  The fourth is that thou be pacyent in trybulacyons.  The fyfth is that thou be perseueraunt in good dedes.  Of these poyntes I spake before in the fourth degree of loue / but for as moche as they be not there fully declared / my wyll is by &thorn;e helpe of god to wryte more openly of eche of them one after an other / &amp; fyrst to wryte of good wyll, for &thorn;at must be begynnynge &amp; endynge of all good dedes.</P></DIV3><DIV3

<HEAD> T &para; How good wyll is and may be in dyuerse maners.</HEAD>
<P>WYll may be [&amp; is] in dyuerse maners / good and euyll / besy &amp; feruent / grete &amp; stronge / but for as moche as reason whiche god hath gyue onely to mankynde techeth &amp; sheweth in euery mannes conscyence full knowynge of euyll wyll / &amp; by cause &thorn;at good wyll may be in dyuerse kyndes / therfore I leue at this tyme to speke of euyl wyl / &amp; purpose me fully thrugh &thorn;e techynge of almyghty god to declare somwhat openly &thorn;e vertue of good wyll.  I trow wel &thorn;at euery man wold be good or wolde do some good dede be he neuer so synful &amp; perauenture not chargeth gretly to be good ne besyeth hym to do good dede. But for as moche as he wolde good I may not saye but [&thorn;at] he hath a good wyll. So [&thorn;at] euery man that wyll well be it strongly or feyntly / lytell or grete / in as moche as he wolde good he hath a good wyll.  Neuertheles though this be a good wyll it is worthy lytell or no mede / for it is no feruent ne besy wyll, for he desyreth to be good without ony trauayle / &amp; so he suffreth that good wyl passe &amp; chargeth not gretly to be good ne to do good dede.  But what tyme he besyeth hym to performe that good wyll in dede / in that he desyreth to be good &amp; besyeth hym to do good though he haue not fully his purpose ne may not performe his wyll in dede / yet there is a feruent wyll &amp; a besy wyll &amp; [as] I hope a medeful wyll.  So that what man desyreth to be good &amp; to do good dede, &amp; therto besyeth hym to performe that wyll in dede, of hym it may wel be sayd that he hath a feruent wyll.  Yet is &thorn;at wyll but lytell acounted &amp; feble hauynge rewarde to a grete &amp; stronge wyll.  But what tyme thou hast performed in dede that thou hast so feruently wylle[d], than thou hast a grete &amp; a stronge wyll / so that of euery man that is in wyll to be good or to do good dedes, whan he performeth that wyll in dede it may be sayd sothly of hym &thorn;at he is a man of a grete and a stronge wyl.  To this acordeth saynt Austyn &amp; sayth thus:  He that wyl do the commaundementes of god &amp; sayth he may not he hath a good wyll / [but] that wyll is but lytell &amp; feble / for he may do &amp; kepe the commaundementes whan he hath a grete &amp; a stronge wyll.  As who sayth what man hath a grete &amp; a stronge wyll may kepe the commaundementes of god / and but


<PB N="2: 91">

he kepe them he hath no grete ne stronge wyll.  Yf thou wylt thou mayst kepe the commaundementes of god / yf thou kepe them thou shalt be good &amp; do good / so yf thou wylt &thorn;ou mayst do good &amp; be good.  But yet somtyme &amp; ofte it falleth that by the grace of the holy ghoost we wyl do somwhat with al our herte to the worshyp of god that is not in our myght ne power to performe in dede; whan our wyll is sette in this maner the goodnes of god is so moche that he receyueth that wyll as for dede.  Of this saynt Austyn bereth wytnes &amp; sayth:  What thou wylt &amp; mayst not do god acounteth for dede.  Thus mayst thou knowe with-in thy-selfe whan thou hast a lytell or a feble wyl / a grete or a stronge wyll / &amp; how acceptable a good wyll is to almyghty god where thou doost thy besynes to performe it in dede.  But se now more openly &amp; in specyal poyntes how thou shalt knowe whan thou hast a good wyl.  Saynt Gregory sayth: We haue a good wyl whan we drede the harme of our neyghboure as our owne dysease / &amp; whan we be Ioyfull of the prosperyte of our neyghboure as of our owne proufyte.  Also whan we trowe other mennes harmes [our harmes] as by waye of compassyon / &amp; whan we acounten other mennes wynnynges our wynnynges as by waye of charyte.  Also whan we loue our frende not for the worlde but for god / &amp; whan we loue &amp; suffre our enemye for the loue of god.  Also whan we do to no man that we wolde that no man dyde to vs.  Also whan we helpe our neyghboure to our power and in wyll somwhat ouer our power.  These poyntes stande moche by the wyll withoute dede / but who so wylleth these fully in his herte to be do hath a good wyll, And as I sayd before his good wyll shall be acounted before god as for dede.  Thus than haue I shewed whiche is good &amp; feruent wyll though it be not performed in dede / whiche is a grete and a stronge wyll / and how good wyll in some poyntes is acounted for dede before god all be it that it be not performed / so that the wyller do his besynes to his power. &para; Take hede now ferthermore and be ware for though thou haue all these maners of good wyll to thy felynge / it may be so that yet thy wyll is not rygtfull / se how.  Be thou neuer so full of wertues: but thou conforme thy wyll to goddes wyll in all maner thynges bodely and ghoostly thy wyll is not ryghtfull.  To this purpose saynt Austyn sayth thus:  The ryghtwysnes of god is that thou be somtyme hole of body &amp; somtyme syke / and perauenture whan thou art hole and in prosperyte / than the wyll of god pleaseth the moche and thou sayst that he is a good god and a curteys; yf thou say so or thynke so onely for thou hast helth or welth of body / thou hast no ryghtful wyl for as moche as thou conformest not thy wyll to goddes wyll / but onely in helth and welth.  For yf he sente the sykenesse or other dysease / perauenture thou woldest be sory and grutch ayenst the wyll and the sendynge of god / &amp; soo in thy wyll thou woldest make the wyll of god / the whiche may not be but euermore ryght and euen, bowe downe to thy wyll / whiche boweth and is full crocked / and in this thou hast ne[i&thorn;]er ryghtfull herte ne ryghtfull wyll.  But what tyme thou dressest thy wyll that is so croked and makest it stande ryght with &thorn;e wyll of god whiche may not be croked but euer standeth euen / that is to saye noo thynge wylle[st] helth ne sykenesse / welth ne wo / but euer holdest the pleased with the wyl

of god, than thou hast a ryghtfull wyll.  &para; Also it is nedefull to a good wyll that [shall] encreace in vertues and come to the loue of god, that it be stable and resonable.  What tyme thou art trauayled sore with temptacions and grutchest not ayenst goddes wyl but with a glad herte thou thankest god &amp; suffrest hym lowely &amp; thynkest well it is chastysynge to the for thy synnes, than is thy wyll stable. And whan thou desyrest not hygh rewarde in blysse for thy good lyuynge or ghoostly trauayle whiche thou hast here in erthe but onely at goddes wyll what he wyll dyspose for the &amp; no thynge at thy wyll, than thou hast a resonable wyll. Thus I haue shewed the dyuerse kyndes of good wyl whiche be full spedefull &amp; nedefull the for to knowe yf thou be in good wyll to [conne] loue god / &amp; yf thou haue a stable &amp; a resonable wyll &thorn;ou shalt soone come to parfyte loue.  &para; Now perauenture thou &thorn;at trauaylest in ghoostly werkes wylt thynke or say thus / somtyme it happe[th] that thou woldest do some ghoostly trauayle &amp; thou may not performe it in dede / &amp; all be it so thou do it in dede it is full oft with so grete heuynesse &thorn;at thou grutche somwhat for defaute of ghoostly comfort.  To this I may answere as I sayd before: yf &thorn;ou grutche &thorn;ou hast no stable wyll, &amp; yf thy wyll be stable &thorn;ou shalt not drede in this case / &amp; se why.  Thou shalt vnderstande &thorn;at the flesshe is euer contraryous to &thorn;e spyryte &amp; &thorn;e spyryte contrarye to &thorn;e flesshe: herof &thorn;ou hast ensample where saynt Poule sayd of hymself in this wyse:  &THORN;at goodnes whiche I wolde do I do not / as yf he had sayd thus:  Some good dedes I wyll &amp; desyre in my soule / but I may not fulfyl them for feblenes of my flesshe / &amp; all be it somtyme I performe them in dede it is without ony gladnes.  but what, for this trowest &thorn;ou &thorn;at thapostle sholde therfore lese his mede / for he wolde &amp; myght not or els [for] he dyde good somtyme without gladnes? Nay, but moche the more his mede was encreaced, for two causes.  Fyrst for the trauaylous werkynge of his body that he suffred whan the flesshe stryued soo sore ayenst the goodnes of the spyryte.  The seconde cause is for the heuynes &amp; trauayle whiche &thorn;e spyryte suffred whan he had no ghoostly comforte.  In the same maner what euer grutchynge thou hast of thy flesshe ayenst good dedes or what heuynesse thou suffrest for defaute of ghoostly conforte / be not therfore abasshed so thy wyll be stable, but suffre &amp; abyde lowely the grace of god for thy more mede.  Be than stable in wyll &amp; the deuyll ne thy flesshe shall neuer haue maystrye of the / for all the deuyls in hell may not make the to synne but &thorn;ou put therto thy wyll.  Ne all the aungels of heuen may not make the to do good dedes but &thorn;ou put-to thy wyll.  &para; Take hede than that thy wyll be well dysposed to god &amp; that it be set stably &amp; resonably / &amp; than thou hast a spedefull begynnynge to come to the loue of god.  but for as moche as mannes wyll is ordeyned fyrst &amp; dysposed with the grace of god that he shall wyll good: to haue that grace in wyll &amp; in all other dede / Prayer me thynketh is nedefull &amp; therfore somwhat I wyl wryte of prayer as god wyll gyue me grace.</P></DIV3><DIV3

a man in all goodnesse.  Therfore god sayth to his dyscyples thus:  Waketh &amp; prayeth that ye fall not in [to] temptacyons.  Ryght as it is nedefull for a knyght that shall go in to batayll haue with hym armoure &amp; wepen / ryght so it is nedeful &amp; spedefull to euery crysten man to haue with hym contynuell prayer / for what of our owne freelte / what by [the] malyce &amp; enuye that the fende hath to vs / we be euer in this worlde in ghoostly batayll more or lesse by the suffraunce of our lorde god.  Therfore sayth saynt Gregory:  The more we be trauayled with thoughtes or flesshely desyres / the more nede we haue to stande besely in prayers.  So thus &thorn;ou mayst se that prayer is spedefull &amp; nedefull.  &para; Also prayer as I rede is a souerayne helpe to thy soule / confort &amp; solace to thy good aungell / torment &amp; payne to &thorn;e deuyl / acceptable seruyce to god / parfyte Ioye / sad hope / &amp; ghoostly helthe without corrupcyon.  &para; Prayer is also a nedefull messager from euery mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen / &amp; namely from that mannes soule whiche is moche troubled &amp; hath no reste.  Some conscyences there be whiche be good / that is to saye be well ruled &amp; be in reste / to suche prayer is also a nedefull messager to holde &thorn;e soule in ghoostly confort &amp; to encreace it &amp; stable it in goodnes.  But there be many other men &amp; wymen of dyuerse conscyence.  Some there be that haue a bad conscyence whiche be in rest &amp; not troubled / &amp; that ben they that ben sette fully to euyll &amp; not to good.

Whyle the conscyence is thus troubled the soule hath no reste / therfore to pursyewe for helpe &amp; grace / prayer that nedefull messager must do well his offyce / that is to saye besely without ony taryenge / &amp; strongely without ony feynynge; &amp; rather [to] come to the presence of almyghty god hym nedeth to haue two specyall frendes / &thorn;at is to say stedfast fayth and trusty hope: with these two frendes prayer taketh his waye &amp; renneth fast to &thorn;e yates of heuen / &amp; entreth without ony lettynge / for he goth to the presence of &thorn;at good lorde truly to do his message with full fayth &amp; sad hope / full pyteously he sheweth his nedes &amp; the perylles of [the] soule.  Than anone the good lorde so ful of pyte &amp; mercy sendeth his blessyd loue in to &thorn;e soule thorugh the pursute of that good prayer.  Whan this loue entreth in to that soule anone he maketh all glad &thorn;at was full elenge &amp; sory / he maketh in peas &amp; reste that was sore troubled.

Whan the enemyes of the soule / that is to saye the fendes se this helpe &amp; confort to the soule / with sorowfull chere they torne awaye &amp; thus they begynne to crye:  Alas alas, sorowe &amp; wo is come to vs / fle we fast awaye for god fyghteth for this soule.     Thus mannes soule is delyuered fro the fende by prayer / &amp; so it may sothly be sayd that prayer is a spedefull &amp; a nedefull messager fro mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen.  &para; Thus &thorn;ou hast herde what is prayer / se now ferthermore how &thorn;ou shalt praye. &para; As often as thou prayest / or what euer thou prayest, put all thy wyll in [to] goddes wyll / in the ende of thy prayer / desyrynge euermore in euery askynge his wyll to be fulfylled and no thynge thy wyll.  For thou mayst praye &amp; aske

some thynge that he wyl not here ne graunte / as yf &thorn;ou praye for soules that be dampned thy prayer is not accepted.  Also it may so be that thou desyrest not that is moost helpynge to thy soule ne to other perauenture for whom &thorn;ou prayest.  Also many men praye somtyme for no good entent / and for that they be not herde.  Therfore to be alwaye syker, whan euer thou prayest put thy desyre and thy entent in askynge in goddes wyl, for he knoweth all thynges, and what euer thou prayest he wyll not graunte the but that is moost proufytable for the.  To this accordeth an holy clerke and sayth:  Oftentyme god graunteth not many men at theyr wyll / for he wyll graunte them other grace than they aske, to more helth of theyr soules.  So that it is nedeful that we put all our askynge in to his ordynaunce.  To this acordeth [also] saynt Bernarde and sayth: No man sholde set lyght by his prayer / for he to whom we praye aftertyme the prayer is passed from our mouth or from our herte / he wryteth it in his booke / and trustyngly we may hope that he wyll graunte that we aske or ellys that is more proufytable to vs.  Thus than what euer thou prayest put all thy wyll in to goddes wyll.  &para; Also whan that thou prayest thou shalt praye generally / that is to saye / as thou prayest for thy selfe so thou shalt praye for other.  Thus thou must do for thre causes:  Fyrst for loue and charyte wyll that thou do so. And therfore sayth the apostle:  Prayeth eche of you for other that ye may be saued.  The seconde cause is / for the lawe of god wyll that euery man helpe other in nede.  This thou hast by the techynge of saynt Poule where as he sayth thus:  Eche of you bere others burthen / that is for to say / eche of you praye for other or helpe other in nede &amp; so ye shall fulfyll the lawe of cryste. The thyrde cause is / for who so prayeth for al other as for hymselfe / &thorn;e goodnes of god wyll that he shall be partyner of all other mennes prayers. To this acordeth saynt Ambrose &amp; sayth thus:  Yf thou pray onely for thy self and for none other than shall none other pray for the but thy selfe / &amp; yf thou praye for all other than all other shall praye for the.  Thus than whan &thorn;ou prayest praye for all other.  &para; Also whan thou shalt praye thou must praye with full herte &amp; put away fro the all vanytees of the worlde, all ymagynacyons &amp; all ydel thoughtes.  To this acordeth an holy clerke &amp; sayth:  Whan we stande to praye we must with all our herte gyue our entent to that we praye / that is to say we must voyde all flesshely &amp; all worldely thoughtes &amp; suffre not our herte otherwyse to be occupyed than about our prayer.  But to this perauenture thou sayst that though &thorn;ou be neuer in so good wyll to praye / thyn herte is awaye from thy prayer &amp; encombred with dyuerse thoughtes that thou mayst haue no whyle thyn herte sadly vpon thy prayer.  To this I graunte &thorn;at what [thrugh] the fende whiche euer is besy to lette all goodnes &amp; what thrugh the vnstablynes of man thyn herte shall not be stable vpon thy prayer I trowe scarsely the tyme of a Pater noster.  But whan thou go to thy prayer / take good hede what nede thou hast to praye / what thou wylt praye / &amp; how grete, how myghty &amp; how ryghtfull &amp; mercyfull he is to whom &thorn;ou wylt praye.  Yf thou set thyn herte thus in the begynnynge of thy prayer / thou shalt not I trow gretly be

Yf thou wylt fyght wylfully in this maner god of his grete grace &amp; endeles pyte wyll alowe thy good wyll / &amp; moche the rather for thy trauayle graunte that &thorn;ou askest.  Thus than whan thou wylt praye &thorn;ou must praye with full herte.  &para; Also an other maner prayer there is / that who soo hath grace to come therto his prayer shal soone be herde yf he praye resonably.  This maner of prayer is whan thou art vysyted by the grace of god with grete conpunccyon of herte and swetnes of deuocyon.  Conpunccyon is a grete lou[nes] of thy soule spryngynge out of thy herte with teeres of thyn eyen, whan &thorn;ou bethynkest the vpon thy synnes &amp; vpon the dredefull dome of god.  Whan &thorn;ou hast this conpunccyon &amp; these teeres than &thorn;ou hast full deuocyon / with suche deuocyon besely praye for all tho that haue nede / for what thynge &thorn;ou prayest in &thorn;at tyme so it be worshyp to god &thorn;ou art anone herde without ony taryenge.  For as I rede prayer peaseth almyghty god &amp; maketh hym torne to mercy; but whan deuoute teeres come with prayer than of his grete pyte he may no lenger suffre / but anone as he were constrayned he graunteth what we aske.  Ferthermore yf &thorn;ou be vsed to suche deuocion &thorn;ou shalt feruently desyre to conne loue god / &amp; so by goddes grace &thorn;ou shalt soone come to loue / thus than loue prayer yf thou wylt come to &thorn;e loue of god.  And for as moche as many men &amp; women be moche trauayled by dyuerse temptacyons or they come to loue / therfore [to] be ware of theym &amp; sooner to withstande them / somwhat I wyl shewe of temptacyons as me thynketh is nedefull.</P></DIV3><DIV3

The power of this wycked spyryte / that is to saye the fende is so grete &thorn;at the more a man besyeth hym to please god &thorn;e rather he is about to greue hym.  For as I rede oftymes it happeth &thorn;at many men whan th[e]y gyue them hole to contemplacyon or to other deuocyons than they be trauayled with stronge temptacyons by &thorn;[e] suffraunce of god, that they may knowe theyr owne feblenes &amp; to kepe theym meke &amp; lowe, for they sholde not lese &thorn;e grete mede of god for ony maner spyce of pryde / whiche mede is ordeyned for theyr ghoostly trauayle.

Some men &amp; women profer themyselfe to synne wylfully &amp; abyde not the temptacyons of the fende / but they go before the temptacyons &amp; be redyer to synne than the fende is to tempte them.  &para; And sythen it is so that euery man whiche is besy to please god shal be trauayled and pr[e]ued with dyuerse temptacyons, I wyl shewe the to my felynge, and as I rede of other auctours, &thorn;e maner of begynnynge of euery temptacyon, that thou mayst be ware of them &amp; rather withstande the begynnynge, &amp; so ouercome the hole temptacyon.  &para; I rede that our enemye the fende whan he wyll make vs to folowe his wyll or ellys for enuye wyll trauayle and greue vs, he begynneth with fals suggestyons / that is to saye he putteth in our myndes diuerse ymagynacyons / as worldely &amp; flesshely thoughtes, and somtyme other thoughtes whiche be full greuous &amp; peryllous / eyther to make vs haue a grete lust &amp; lykynge in them that be worldely or flesshely / or ellys to brynge vs in grete heuynes or drede thrugh tho thoughtes whiche be greuous &amp; peryllous.  &para; As to the worldely or flesshely thoughtes, yf we suffre theym to abyde in oure herte so longe wylfully tyll we haue lykynge in them / than hath the deuyll wonne a grete stronge warde of vs &amp; pursyeweth ferthermore with all his besynes to make vs assente to hym as in wyll to performe it in dede.  By that dede thou mayst vnderstande euery dedely synne after &thorn;e suggestyon is in &thorn;e begynnynge.  To some he begynneth with a fals suggestyon of pryde / or ellys of couetyse / to some with a suggestyon of glotonye or lecherye / and so of all other synnes wherin he supposeth soonest to haue maystrye ouer man / for euery man is enclyned more to one maner synne than to an other.  And where he hath maystrye / that is to say where that synne is performed in dede / he besyeth hym sore to brynge it in to custome / &amp; so thorugh the custome to haue vs hole vnder his power.  Go fle &amp; withstande all these perylles, the prophete Dauyd sayth in the sawter: Go awaywarde or bowe awaye from euyll &amp; do good / that is to saye after the exposycyon of doctours: Go from the euyll of suggestyon / from the suggestyon of entysynge / from &thorn;e euyl of delytynge / from the euyll of assentynge / from the euyl of dede / &amp; from the euyll of custome.  Withstande than all suche worldely or flesshely thoughtes as moche as god wyll gyue the grace, &thorn;at thou fal in none of these euylles whiche as I haue sayd be full peryllous.  &para; Ferthermore as to &thorn;e greuous thoughtes &amp; peryllous, perauenture &thorn;ou wylt aske whiche be tho thoughtes &thorn;at be so greuous &amp; peryllous. All tho thoughtes that thou hast ayenst thy wyl whiche make the heuy or sory, be greuous.  And for to shewe the more openly: what man that ymagy[n]eth vpon hyghe maters &thorn;at be ghoostly whiche passe all erthely mennes wytte, As vpon &thorn;e fayth of holy chyrche or suche other that neden not to be specyf[y]ed at this tyme, that man hath greuous thoughtes &amp; peryllous.

Of suche temptacyons it is nedefull to be ware &amp; put theym awaye yf &thorn;ou may with deuoute prayers &amp; other occupacyons / &amp; yf thou may not voyde them suffre them than esely.

Also thou shalt suffre suche thoughtes esely / but thou mayst voyde them / for all suche thoughtes so &thorn;at thou delyte the not in them they ben a grete purgynge for thy soule / &amp; a grete strength to kepe within the vertues / &amp; all be it &thorn;at they be sharpe &amp; bytter for the tyme thynke well &thorn;at they shal make thy soule clene that was ryght foule / &amp; make it hole that was ryght syke / and brynge it in to euerlastynge lyfe &amp; helth without ende to the whiche lyfe &amp; helth may no man come withoute grete sharpenes &amp; bytternes.  Also whan &thorn;ou art trauayled with thoughtes whiche &thorn;ou mayst not put away, thynke wel that it is a grete ryghtwysnes of god that thou haue suche thoughtes: For ryght as &thorn;ou hast had full often thy wyl &amp; lykynge in worldely and flesshely thoughtes ayenst the wyll of god / ryght so it is &thorn;e wyl of god that thou haue other thoughtes ayenst thy wyl.  &para; But yet it is good that thou be ware of them &amp; that &thorn;ou drede them dyscretly and truste stedfastly in god.  For whan the soule hath no delyte in suche thoughtes but hateth &amp; lotheth them / than they be a clensynge &amp; a grete mede to &thorn;e soule; but yf it so be that there come somtyme ony lykynge of synne or of ony vanyte thorugh suche thoughtes / than withstande &amp; thynke that it is a fals suggestyon of the deuyll / &amp; therwith be dredful and sory that &thorn;ou hast offended god in lykynge of suche fals ymagynacyons.  I rede that for suche thoughtes onely &thorn;ou shalt not be dampned though they be come in to thy mynde / for it is not in thy power to let them to come: But yf it be so that &thorn;ou assente or delyte in them than be ware, for there thou dyspleasest god.  Also it is good that &thorn;ou drede though &thorn;ou assente not to euyll thoughtes, that &thorn;ou fall not for pryde.  For eche man that standeth in vertues standeth onely by &thorn;e vertue &amp; grace of almyghty god.  Thus than be ware of thoughtes, for here &thorn;ou mayst se that all temptacyons begynne with fals suggestyons of the wycked spyryte. And yf &thorn;ou haue grace to withstande suche thoughtes &thorn;ou shalt ouercome all temptacions.  And for moost souerayn remedy ayenst all maner temptacions it is good that &thorn;ou shewe thy disease to thy ghoostly fader as oft as it nedeth [or] els to some other good man of ghoostly lyuynge, as I sayd before in the fyfth poynt of &thorn;e thyrde degree of loue.     &para; Ferthermore to speke of temptacyons, I rede that whan the wycked fende may not ouercome a man wakynge / than is his besynes to trauayle &amp; to tary hym slepynge.  And that is to dysceyue hym yf he may in thre maners.  One is to begyle hym thrugh glad &amp; confortable dremes.  The seconde is to greue &amp; to lette hym thrugh sorowfull &amp; dredefull dremes.  And the thyrde is to make hym the rather assente to synne wakynge thrugh foule syghtes or other dyuerse vanytees whiche he suffreth slepynge. therfore it is good to be ware of dremes / for in some thou mayst wel byleue &amp; some it is good to sette at nought.  for somtyme god sheweth comfort to wycked men slepynge &thorn;at they sholde the rather leue theyr synne, &amp; somtyme he comforte[th] good men slepynge to make them more feruent in his loue; but for as moche as &thorn;ou myghtest lyghtly be disceyued thrugh suche illusyons, I counseyll

the to put them all out from thy herte or els to shewe them to thy ghostly frendes.  For oftymes he &thorn;at hath moche lykynge in dremes is moost taryed and out of reste.  Also &thorn;ou shalt not drede suche dremes what-soeuer they be: For as I rede yf thou be stable in the fayth of holy chyrche / yf &thorn;ou loue god with all thy herte / yf &thorn;ou be obedyent to god &amp; to thy souerayns what euer &thorn;ou be as well in aduersyte as in prosperyte, and yf &thorn;ou put all thy wyll at goddes dysposycyon, than shalt &thorn;ou drede no maner of dremes; for though they be dredefull &amp; sorowfull to thy syght be therfor not agast ne heuy / but trustyngly put al togyder in to goddes honde he to ordeyne for the as he wyll.  Also though they be to thy syght glad &amp; confortable, desyre them not ne byleue not in them but yf it [so] be that they torne to the worshyp of god.  Yf &thorn;ou do thus by the grace of god &thorn;ou shalt ouercome all temptacions slepynge.

<P>CHaryte whiche is moder &amp; keper of vertues is lost full often by Inpacyence. To this acordeth saynt Gregorye &amp; sayth thus: Men that be Inpacyent whan they wyll not suffre gladly trybulacyons / destroye the good dedes whiche they dyde whyle &thorn;e soule was in peas &amp; reste / &amp; sodaynly they destroye [w]hat ghoostly werke that they haue begonne by good auysement &amp; grete trauayle.  By these wordes it semeth &thorn;at it is nedefull to kepe with vs the vertue of pacyence yf we sholde come to the loue of god / for without encreace of vertues we may not come to &thorn;at loue.  &para; To speke than of pacyence:  I rede &thorn;at in prosperyte it is no vertue to be pacyent / but what man is troubled with many aduersytees &amp; standeth stably hopynge in the mercy of god / he hath the vertue of pacyence. &para; In thre maner of wayes goddes seruauntes haue nede to be pacyent in trybulacions.  The fyrst is whan god chastyseth them with his rodde / as with losse of worldely godes or ellys with bodely sykenes.  The seconde is whan our enemye the fende trauayleth vs with dyuerse temptacyons by the suffraunce of god.  The thyrde is whan our neyghbours do to vs wronge or despytes.  In eche of these thre our enemye besyeth hym to brynge vs oute of pacyence / &amp; in eche of these we sholde ouercome hym yf we be pacyent.  As thus: yf we suffre easely &amp; gladly the chastysynge of god without ony grutchynge; Also yf we delyte vs not in the fals suggestyons of the fende &amp; assente in no maner to his wycked temptacyons;

Also yf we kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre ony wronges or despytes of ony of our neyghbours / thus we sholde ouercome that wycked fende with the vertue of pacyence.  &para; I sayd as for the fyrst we shold ouercome the fende yf we suffre easely &amp; gladly the chastysynge of god without ony grutchynge / this is good &thorn;at we suffre for it is for grete loue whiche he hath to vs &amp; [for] grete mede that he wyll ordeyne for vs.  To this purpose saynt Austyn speketh &amp; sayth thus to eche mannes soule callynge the soule doughter, and sayth thus: Doughter yf thou wepe vnder thy fader wepe not with Indygnacion ne for pryde / for that thou suffrest is for medycyne to the &amp; for no payne / it is a chastysynge &amp; no dampnacyon; yf thou wylt not lese thyn herytage, put not from the that rodde / take no hede to the sharpenes of that rodde / but take good hede how well thou shalt be rewarded in thy faders testament. These wordes may be remeued to euery crysten man &amp; woman, as thus: Yf our fader in heuen sholde chastyse vs with losse of goodes or with sykenes of body we sholde not grutche / but we sholde be sory &thorn;at we trespaced ayenste our fader / &amp; take mekely his chastysynge &amp; euer aske mercy.  His chastysynge is hel[&thorn;]e to our soules &amp; reles of grete[r] penaunce / his chastysynge is but a warnynge for loue &amp; not dur[esse] for wrath.  [If] we sholde not be put out frome the herytage of heuen it is nedefull we be boxum to our fader in heuen &amp; suffre lowely &amp; gladly his ryghtfull chastysynge for our greuous trespasynge, that thrugh the vertue of pacyence we may come to that grete herytage / that is to saye to the blysse of heuen to &thorn;e whiche he ordeyned vs in his last testament, that was whan he gafe for vs his herte blood vpon &thorn;e crosse.  Thus we must suffre gladly the chastysynge of god without grutchynge.  This chastysynge as I sayd is somtyme in sykenes of body / &amp; somtyme in losse of worldely goodes.  Yf thou be chastysed with sykenesse of body / haue in thy mynde the wordes of the apostle whan he sayd thus: All be it that our body outwarde be corrupted with sykenes our soule within is made newe &amp; more clene frome daye to daye.  Also yf [thou] be chastysed with losse of goodes / take hede to &thorn;e pouerte of Iob where &thorn;ou may haue a grete example of pacyence, for with grete thankynges to god he toke full mekely &amp; gladly grete pouerte, sykenes &amp; many dyseases &amp; sayd:  Our lord gafe / our lorde hath take awaye / as it pleaseth hym so it is do / blessyd be the name of &thorn;at lorde Iesu.  Thus &thorn;ou hast example to suffre gladly the chastysynge of god.  &para; I sayd also as for the seconde we sholde ouercome &thorn;e fende yf we delyte vs not in his fals suggestyons &amp; yf we assente in no maner to his wycked temptacyons.  In the last chapytre before thou hast how thou shalt be stronge &amp; stable ayenst all temptacyons: Se now more openly why thou shalt gladly suffre temptacyons without ony grutchynge.  One skylle is for yf thou suffre them not gladly but grutchest ayenst them than &thorn;ou lettest them that sholde helpe the / the whiche be good angels &amp; other sayntes / &amp; helpest thyn enemyes whiche be wycked fendes / for a greter confort is none to theym but whan they fynde a man heuy and grutchynge; therfore suffre them gladly and aske helpe &amp; mercy of hym in whom all grace is and confort.  Also yf thou suffre suche temptacions gladly and assentest not to them in lykynge ne in wyll / than thou stoppest the

fende that he dar not assayle the with other temptacions, for he dredth to be put out from the &amp; be ouercome whan he feleth the so stable &amp; so pacyent; that is a grete drede to hym.  For whan he trauayleth a man with temptacyons and he be withstande / than be his paynes moche the more encreased in hell.  Withstande than his temptacyons with the vertue of pacyence &amp; so thou shalt ouercome hym.  &para; As for the thyrde way of pacyence I sayd &thorn;at we sholde kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre wronges or despytes of [our] neyghbours / suche wronges it is [m]edefull to suffre for the loue of god:  For as saynt Austyn sayth / he that is so pacyent that gladly wyll suffre wronges shall be ordeyned grete and myghty in heuen.  If than thy goodes be taken from the wrongfully / suffre esely and thynke in thy herte that thou came naked in to this worlde &amp; no better than naked shalt thou go away out of the worlde.  Also thynke vpon &thorn;e wordes of the apostle where he sayth: Nought we brought in to this worlde and no thynge we may bere with vs / thynke vpon these wordes &amp; I trowe they shall styre the moche to pacyence.  &para; If thou be dysp[y]sed or defamed wrongfully / thynke vpon the wordes of cryst whan he sayd thus to his dyscyples: Ye be blessyd whan wycked men curse you or despyse you wrongfully, whan they pursyewe you or saye ony euyll makynge lesynges ayenst you wrongfully / Ioyeth than &amp; be glad for your mede is plenteuous in heuen.  These wordes me thynketh sholde make the to suffre gladly despytes &amp; euyll wordes.  It falleth somtyme that some mennes hertes be full grete &amp; stoute by pryde &amp; Inpacyence: But goddes seruauntes whan they se suche men so dyseased and trauayled in theyr soules, haue grete conpassyon of them knowynge wel that it cometh of vnstablenes of herte and of wycked sterynge of the flesshe / &amp; therfore they suffre wycked &amp; angry wordes for &thorn;e tyme, hopynge &thorn;at after so grete noyse shall come some maner ease &amp; lownes of herte; they suffre also for &thorn;e tyme for they knowe well it is full harde a man to ouercome hymselfe; / for thyse causes euery good man sholde gladly suffre angry wordes.  Also some men and women there be that wyll not suffre / but for one wycked worde they saye an other and take noo hede to the rewarde that they sholde haue of god yf they wolde suffre / suche men al daye fall in temptacyons for angre of herte and for inpacyence.  Therfore what euer thou be that art despysed of thy neyghbour, suffre gladly / &amp; feyne the as thou herdest hym not / vnto the tyme that his herte be eased, and than yf it be suche mater that chargeth &thorn;ou mayst speke to hym in easy maner / and yf it is no chargynge than it is no force though thou holde thy peas and answere ryght nought.

Whiche maner of deth it nedeth not at this tyme for to shewe it to the, For &thorn;ou hast it openly by &thorn;e techynge of all holy chyrche.

TYPE="section"> <HEAD>Z  &para; How perseueraunce is nedefull &amp; how thou mayst be perseueraunt.</HEAD>
<P>PErseueraunce is fulfyllynge &amp; ende of all vertues / keper of all goodnes / without whiche perseueraunce no man may se god.  But thou be perseueraunt / &thorn;ou mayst haue noo mede, thanke ne worshyp for thy seruyce.  Yf thou be perseueraunt thou shalt haue mede for thy true seruyce / &amp; a grete rewarde for thy ghoostly trauayle &amp; a worshypful crowne of vyctorye for thy stronge batayle.  Of this mater &thorn;ou hast before in &thorn;e fyth poynt of the thyrde degree of loue / therefore at this tyme it nedeth not to speke but lytell more as of this purpose.  But I counseyll the in fewe wordes yf thou wylt be perseueraunt in goodnes that &thorn;ou trauaylest to wynne the vertue of pacyence wherof I haue touched somwhat in the last chapytre before.  For many men begynne full well and ende theyr lyfe full peryllously / &amp; the cause is for the more partye Inpacyence / for they wyll not suffre gladly temptacyons &amp; other trybulacyons; For whan they fele neuer so lytel dysease ghoostly or bodely anone they fall awaye from vertues &amp; torne agayne to synne, And often it falleth that some men fall so sore that they deye by that fall / that is to saye they fall in to [so] grete sykenes &amp; peryll of soule / that to our syght they deye in grete synne &amp; errours without ony amendement. Of suche men speketh god almyghty &amp; sayth:  No man &thorn;at putteth his honde to the plowe &amp; loketh behynde hym is dysposed to come to the kyngdom of heuen.  &para; Here perauenture thou woldest aske what is he that holdeth the plowe &amp; loketh behynde hym.  He putteth his honde to &thorn;e plowe that amendeth his synnes with contrycyon &amp; confessyon to brynge forth fruyte of penaunce &amp; to encreace in vertues.  He loketh behynde hym that torneth agayne to synne[s] whiche were forsaken after tyme he had begonne good werkes.  Therfore what euer thou be that hast begonne to leue vyces / torne not agayne to them for a lytell dysease, yf thou wylt haue the grete mede that longeth to perseueraunce.  &para; Also yf thou wylt be perseueraunt thou must be stable in herte / yf &thorn;ou wylt be stable in herte &thorn;ou must be ware of the lykynge &amp; pleasynge of the worlde / &amp; flee from wycked company / thou must take no hede to praysynges ne to blamynges / for of all these cometh vnstablenes, And yf thou haue ony lykynge in ghoostly werkes, that vnstablenes wyll put it awaye; therfore be ware &amp; flee suche maner of occasyons yf thou wylt be stable.  &para; I saye not that &thorn;ou shalt flee bodely from &thorn;e world or fro [&thorn;i] worldely goodes for they be pryncypall occasyons / but I

counseyll the in herte and in wyll that thou flee all suche vanytees.

But sothe it is that the moost sykerest waye is to fle as relygyous do / but for all may not be men or women of relygyon / therfore of euery degre in &thorn;e worlde god hath chosen his seruauntes.  What euer than thou be &thorn;at wy[l]t come to &thorn;e loue of god begynne fyrst to do good dedes with a good wyll and a contynuell desyre.  After that desyre fulfyl thy wyll in dede with dyscrecyon that thou mayst contynue to thy lyues ende.  Whan thou hast begonne thynke in thyn herte that god hath gyue the suche grace to begynne that thynge to his worshyp / thou mayst well do it yf thou wylt performe it in dede with the helpe of god.  After this poynte stande stably in wyll / aske grace of perseueraunce / and performe it in dede with a feruent spyryte.  And whan thou hast begonne dyscretly / though it be trauaylous in the begynnynge / all that trauayle be it in fastynges / wakynges / prayers or ony other ghoostly trauayle, all shall be lyght to the &amp; shall torne the [to] in so grete myrthe and ghoostly conforte that thou shalt sette lytell by the passynge Ioye and the vanytees of the worlde.  Stande than stably in wyll and in dede / and god almyghty that hath begonne good werkes in the / wyll norysshe the forth in all vertues / defende the from thyn enemyes / teche the to loue hym / and kepe the in his loue to thy lyues ende; After this deth thou shalt not drede for thou shalt euer abyde in his kyngdome where that is no care ne drede / but all Ioye &amp; conforte for euermore lastynge.  &para; Now I haue shewed to the foure degrees of loue / &amp; declared here fyue specyall vertues whiche as me thynketh be moost nedeful euery man for to haue that wyl trauayle in ghoostly werkes / &amp; to al other maner men and women they be full spedefull to knowe whether they be relygyous or seculer.

sholde noo man nor woman be heuy or sory for ony temptacyon.  For as saynt Iames the appostle techeth vs we sholde haue very greate Ioye whan we be tempted with dyuers temptacyons / for as the golde is pured and purged by the fyre / and a knyght in batayle is proued good:  ryght so is a man by temptacyon proued for good / but yf he suffre hymselfe to be ouercome / that is to saye but he consent therto by delyberacyon.  For sothely whan a man is sharpely tempted he may than haue hope of gr[et]e vertue / and it is necessary for a man moche to be troubled with temptacyons / for euery vertue is proued by his contrarye. Our enemy the fende is besy daye and nyght to tary and trauayle good men and women with dyuers temptacyons / in doubtes of the fayth and dredes of saluacyon and other many moo in dyuers maners, and specyally now in these dayes he is full besy to deceyue many soules / and therfore wysely rule you to withstande his vyolent sterynges of temptacyon / &amp; for all that take ye noo dredes of his assawtes / ne haue ye ony doubte of his erroures ne dyspytes nor of his false leasynges or fantasyes or ony maner of trauayle of that foule fende; whether ye here hym / se hym or thynke of hym take noo hede therof / for all be maters of grete mede and noo synne in noo wyse be they neuer soo troublous or full of anguysshes whyles it cometh of the malyce of the fende or of euyll dysposycyon of mannes nature or compleccyon.  And therfore all suche trauayle men ought not to charge but suffre mekely and abyde pacyently tyll god doo remedy therto. And for as moche as they be maters of grete mede none ought to stryue there agaynst / nor meruayle of them ne seke the cause nor thynke by what skyll he is soo trauaylled / for the more that a man laboureth in sechynge and thynkynge of suche anguysshes the more depely he falleth in to errours / and therfore in as moche as mannes thought is often vayne and dyuers and none ende hath:  it ought not to be forced or be taken hede of / ne a man sholde not angre hymselfe therwith ne blame ne impute it to his owne defaute that he is so troubled / for suche trauaylles ben paynefull but not synfull in soo moche as they be gretely agaynst his wyll.  Saynt Augustyne sayth that euery synne lyeth in wylfull wyll, And what that is agaynst mannes wyll is noo synne.  And the holy doctour ysodore de summo bono sayth that the fende tempteth a man noo more than god gyueth hym leue.  Therfore let vs haue alway a good wyll to wyll well and doo well / and god wyll kepe vs and gyue vs the vyctory / &amp; so the fende shall be confounded. Fayth &amp; hope is grounde of all perfeccyon and rote of all vertue / and therfore our olde enemy the fende is full besy with all his sleyghtes to drawe the soule downe therfro, And it happeth somtyme that the fende tempteth and trauaylleth a ryghtwyse soule so sharpely that it is ouerlayde with care and dryuen to dyspayre:  and yet all that tyme though the soule perceyue it not it dwelleth styll in the drede and loue of god / and all that trauayle is to theyr grete mede afore god / for our lorde of his endles mercy arrecteth not to &thorn;e soule that synne whiche hymselfe suffreth the fende to werke in the soule without the consente or wyll of the sayd selfe soule.

Syster alwaye whan I speke of a man in this wrytynge take it bothe for man and woman / for so it is ment in all suche wrytynge / for all is mankynde:  and ferthermore as touchynge your troubles thynke in all your dyseases what troubles goddes seruauntes hath suffred and what paynes and turmentes they haue had here in this worlde in many sondry maners and ye shall fynde cause to suffre.  Leo the pope sayth / it happeth somtyme that good and ryghtwyse soules be styred sharpely by the fende / &amp; somtyme by theyr owne compleccyon to angers, troubles, dredes &amp; suche other taryenges that it semeth to them theyr lyf a turment, in so moche that somtyme for very drede the[y] begyn to dyspayre bothe in lyfe of body and soule / thynkynge they be forsaken of god / whiche dooth it but to assaye and proue his chosen chyldren and frendes by suche temptacyons.  For as I afore haue sayd at the begynnynge of this wrytyng, in lyke maner as fyre purgeth golde and as a knyghte is proued good and hardy by batayle:  ryght so temptacyons and troubles purgeth a ryghtwyse soule; this is proued well by Toby / for the aungell Raphaell sayd this to hym:  Toby for as moche as thou arte ryghtfull to god it is nedefull that temptacyon sholde preue thy wyll.  And well it is knowen that sykenes falleth to a man after the dysposycyon of his compleccyon:  So lyke wyse temptacyon, as Leo the pope sayth: The fende our ghostly enemy aspyeth in euery man what wyse he is dysposed by his compleccyon / and by that disposicyon he tempteth hym.  For there as he fyndeth a man full of malencoly he tempteth hym moost with ghoostly temptacyons of Ire.  But they that wyll attende to withstande it for the loue of god they must shape them to pacyence &amp; saye with Iob:  Sythen we haue receyued of god so grete benefaytes why sholde we not receyue and suffre dyseases.  And thynke on the grete anguysshes, sorowes and dyseases that our lorde Ihesu cryste suffred hymselfe here in erth, And also suffred his blyssed moder to haue the same.  And thynke that to suffre dysease pacyently is the waye to heuen-warde. And that ye may not in this frayle worlde be so free as an aungell that is confermed by grace / but whyle your body and soule be togyder in this lyf they must receyue troubles as well as eases.

But some men whan they haue drede of saluacyon or be tempted to dyspayre by vysyons or ghostly sterynges of theyr owne frayltye / they wene anone that they haue synned in the synne of the holy ghoost / and than the fende putteth in them that they may neuer be saued nor forgyuen of theyr trespaces.  Thus speketh the fende within them, so ferynge s[um]e good creatures that they wene to goo out of theyr myndes.  But [ye] that ben thus tempted answere the fende thus agayne that he is false and a lyer as his nature is to be.  For the synne of the holy ghoost as clerkes sayth is infynyte without repentaunce.  And that is whan a man wylfully by delyberacyon wyll neuer repente nor aske god mercy ne forgyuenes of his synnes / nor wyll be tourned / but wylfully departeth hym from the goodnes of god / and in [t]his wretchednes abydeth wylfully with full consent of wyll; he that doth thus synneth in the holy ghoost whiche may not be forgyuen here nor elles where / for he wyll not trust in the goodnes of the holy ghoost nor aske forgyuenes of his synnes, And therefore he that wyll noo mercy aske noo mercy shall haue / for his synnes be infynyte without repentaunce.  But thoughe a man or a woman haue or fele all these vycyous sterynges and as many moo as ony herte can thynke ayenst theyr owne free wyll, and whan reason cometh to them they be sory therof &amp; flee alwaye hastely to the mercy of god:  it is to them but a preuynge or a clensynge of theyr synnes though they be neuer soo ofte in the nyght and the daye now vp now downe as wrestlers be / &amp; thoughe ye haue ony tyme fall in ony synne ghoostly or flesshely &amp; layne therin wylfully by delyberacyon and full content of herte:  ye than ought to be sory and aske god forgyuenes with as grete contrycyon as god wyll gyue you grace / and than thynke fully the goodnes of the holy ghoost surmounteth all synnes that euer was done or euer shall be done / [for] though a man had synned in them all / as well in dede as thought / he beynge truly contryte &amp; confessed mekynge hymselfe lowly to almyghty god and to his sacramentes of holy chyrche / doubte ye not he so askynge mercy shall haue full forgyuenes of all his synnes / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes.  And therfore thoughe ye somtyme here by spekynge or elles of wrytynge or redynge in bokes sharpe wordes and harde sentences:  yet comforte your selfe and thynke well that all suche harde wordes be sayd and wryten to chastyse the synners and to withdrawe them from euyll / and also to pourge and pure goddes specyall louers as the metall is in the fyre afore rehersed / and in them god wyll make his hous.  And wete it well many wordes that seme full harde be ment full tenderly whan they be well vnderstonde / and though some wordes be ment ryght hardely as the playne texte sheweth / yet sholde ye not take them to you-warde / but comforte your selfe and thynke that all those harde sentences shall be fulfylled in Iewes and sarasyns / for the crysten people that wyll be contryte &amp; trust in goddes mercy or haue a wyl so for to do:  they shal escape all perylles / so &thorn;at they shall not perysshe but be saued / where as the Iewes &amp; sarasyns in theyr perylles shal vtterly persysshe to pardycyon / for they

haue not the strength of Baptym ne the precyous oyntement of crystes passyon / that sholde gyue to theyr soules lyf and helth.  Of this [we] haue example &amp; a grete fygure in holy wryte that where as Moyses ledde the chyldren of Israell ouer the reed see whiche were goddes people, Moyses wente before them and smote the water with his rodde and therwith the water parted &amp; the chyldren of Israell wente ouer in suertye, And they of egypte that folowed perysshed &amp; were drowned.  By Moyses I vnderstonde our lorde Ihesu cryste / and by the yerde or rodde that departed &thorn;e water I vnderstonde his holy passyon / and by the chyldren of Israell that were not perysshed all crysten people:  for ryght so our lorde Ihesu cryst came from his faders bosome to the see of trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons to be our guyde &amp; leder / he gooth before vs with his precyous passyon &amp; smyteth awaye the perylles of our troublous temptacyons / so that we shall not perysshe / but it shall brynge vs to suertye of euerlastynge lyf; and therfore gyue we to hym thankynges, louynges &amp; infynyte praysynges as the chyldren of Israell dyde.  For thoughe a crysten man were neuer soo synfull thynkynge hymselfe &thorn;at he stode in the sentence of the hardest wordes that be wryten:  yet sholde he trust faythfully in the mercy of god / for and he wyll forsake his synnes &amp; tourne hym to good and vertuous lyf:  he shall haue grace and forgyuenes / and the harde sharpe wordes of dampnacyon sholde tourne hym to mercy and saluacyon.  For thus sayth our lord god in holy wryte by his prophete Ieremye: though I make grete thretes I shall repent me of my wordes yf my people wyll repent them of theyr synnes.  O beholde the grete goodnes of our lorde / and how pyte alwaye constrayneth hym to mercy, worshyp and thankes be euer to his goodnes; he is so benygne and mercyfull to them that be repentaunt that he frely wyll chaunge his sentences from sharpe vengeaunce to forgyuenes / &amp; of the paynes that they be worthy to suffre / gyue them alygeaunce or lyghter payne to suffre.  He sayth also by the prophete I saye:  I shall forgyue the synnes of euery man that with very true contrycyon wyll drawe hym to good and vertuous lyfe.  And this grete mercy shewed our lorde openly vpon the Cyte of Niniue / and also by kynge E&yogh;echie.  Therfore lette noo man dyspayre but alwaye trust fully to goddes mercy that so well can redresse our myscheues and tourne all our woo to wele / and our sorowe to Ioye.  O thou gloryous [&] myghtyfull god that thus meruayllously werketh in thy creatures, it is to se that thy mercy is large and brode whiche maketh the to chaunge thy sentence that before was bothe thy wyll and worde / blessyd be thou good lorde in all thy vertues for thou canst / may / and wyll tourne and chaunge all our infyrmytees to our moost proufyte yf we wyll not flee from the / but tourne to thy goodnes and aske mercy.  But for all this grete goodnes / god forbede that ony man sholde be the more bolder to synne, or wylfully and wyttyngly by delyberacyon sholde presume to falle to synne vpon trust of [his] mercy; and [for] our lorde is so mercyfull I surely trust that euery true courteys soule wyl be the more lothe to offende his goodnes. [But] as for you that be tempted ayenst your wyll / and wyll not for all the worlde dysplease god wylfully:  but that ye be thus begyled and encombred by the fende with many paynefull thoughtes / be ye not afrayde of the fende nor of his fere-

full assawtes / for he is full sore dyscomforted whan that he seeth a man or a woman whiche he soo tempteth is not aferde of hym.  Somtyme the fende cometh and tempteth a soule fyersly lyke a dragon / and somtyme he assaylleth hym lyke a rampynge lyon; but and yf a creature strength hymselfe saddely in the passyon of almyghty god / and arme hym with that holy passyon / a thousande suche fendes how someuer that they come shall haue noo more power ouer hym thenne hath as many flyes or gnattes.  And therfore strength you all in god / and be not abasshed soo to strength and arme you in hym though ye be synfull / for he sayth hymselfe in the gospell he came for synners.  And in an other place of the gospell he saythe that he came for mercy and not for noo vengeaunce / and to be our shelde and strength; and so lette vs humbly with a meke herte take hym.  And yf ye fele ony dredes by ymagynacyon or temptacyon or for wordes that ye haue herde or redde in bookes by the whiche ye doubte of saluacyon / than thynke on the wordes that cryste hymselfe taught to a man that doubted / sayenge and askynge of our lorde who sholde be saued / for he thoughte it was to harde to hymselfe for to eschewe all the poyntes that ledde man to pardycyon.  And our lorde badde hym for to saye <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem creatorem celi et terre, Et in iesum christum filium eius,</FOREIGN> Byleue sayd our lorde Ihesu that god the fader is almyghty and that no thynge to hym is impossyble but that he may forgyue all synnes and redresse all wronges and brynge the soules to his blysse.  and thynke ferthermore that his myght and power may do all that his wysdome can / and his goodnes wyl / and therfore truste fully that by his goodnes he wyll saue you and brynge you to euerlastynge Ioye whan he seeth best tyme / for he hath bought you full dere with his precyous blode and paynefull deth.  And I dare sauely saye that there is none so synfull a caytyf whiche is crystened or wolde be crystened this daye on the erthe all thoughe he were in the syght of god dampnable and in the syght of all creatures also, ye and yet were Iuged to be dampned by all scrypture, and he wolde forsake his synne and be contryte and aske god forgyuenes he sholde haue mercy and forgyuenes of hym / &amp; yf it were so that he stode in that case or had a good mynde to stonde so in the tyme of deth he sholde be saued / the myght &amp; mercy of god is so grete that it surmounteth all his lawes, Iugementes and scryptures. And so our lorde Ihesus sheweth vs by an example in the gospell of a woman that was founde in aduoutry and by Moyses lawe whiche was ordeyned by god &thorn;at she sholde be stoned to the deth:  But the myght and the wysdome of that blessyd lorde god was soo gretely shewed to the phary&yogh;ens whiche accused her that they so largely perceyued theyr synnes that they myght not for shame deme her but stale awaye out of the temple, And our lorde Ihesu wolde not deme her but of his gracyous mercy forgaue her all her synnes.  And therfore be a man or woman neuer soo synfull and that they fele neuer soo many bodely and ghostly synnes alwaye rysynge and sterynge within them / they sholde neuer the rather dyspayre of the mercy of god / ne be dyscomforted.  For there as moche synne is / there is shewed moche mercy and grace / and the goodnes of god is knowen by the forgyuenes of the synne whan a body turneth hym there-from and is very

contryte; but god forbede as I sayd before that ony creature be the more recheles or bolde to synne wylfully / for in so moche the mercy of god is so large we ought to be the more besy and dylygent to loue and prayse hym.  Almyghty god werketh lyke a leche / for a leche suffreth somtyme the deed flesshe to growe on hym that he hath in cure / but afterwarde he taketh away the same and maketh the quycke flesshe to growe / and soo he heleth the pacyent.  Ryght soo dooth our lorde Ihesu cryste maker of heuen and erth, suffreth somtyme a man or a woman to fall in deedly synne:  but afterwarde of his grete mercy and pyte he putteth-to his hande of grace / for they that were deedly wounded thorough synne he heleth them and wassheth away theyr synnes with the water of his well of mercy / &amp; maketh in them quycke vertues to growe wherby he gyueth to theym euerlastynge lyfe.  Oure lorde god is also lyke a gardyner:  for a gardyner suffreth somtyme wycked wedes to growe in his gardyn / and whan the erth thorugh moysture of rayne wexeth tender he taketh &amp; pulleth awaye the wedes bothe rote &amp; rynde.  So in lyke wyse dooth our lorde Ihesu cryst, he suffreth somtyme in his gardyn whiche is mannes soule wycked dedes of synne to growe / but whan the herte of man wexeth tender by mekenes and moysture of contrycyon he than taketh away all the synnes bothe rote and rynde and planteth and setteth in his gardyn herbes and fruytes of good vertues / and watreth them with the dewe of his blessyd goodnes / wherby the soule of man shall come to euerlastynge Ioye and reste.  Now than sythen our lorde god is so good, so pyteous and soo mercyfull to synners that wylfully offendeth hym by commyttynge of horryble synnes / moche more he is mercyfull and hath pyte and compassyon of a soule that thorughe trouble and temptacyons falleth to synne / for almyghty god suffreth often tymes the soule of man for to be tempted and vexed in withstandynge temptacyons / wherof it deserueth the more meryte.  And therfore be ye not doubtefull nor heuy for it shall neuer tourne you to peryll ne daunger but to grete proufyte.  For therby ye shall wynne the crowne of glorye and the palme of vyctorye whiche shall be gyuen to you for withstandynge of suche temptacyons &amp; to the fende it shall tourne to shame and confusyon; and though it semeth to you somtyme that ye fele dyscorde bytwene god and you be not therfore recreaunt ne dyscomforted, For almyghty god sayth by his prophete Isaye: A lytell whyle I haue forsaken and hydde my face from the:  but I shall call the to me agayne by my ma[ny]folde mercyes whiche euer shall endure.</P></DIV4><DIV4

Therfore ye good chyldren that sharpely be vexed with suche temptacyons &amp; tribulacions, comforte yourselfe in your benygne &amp; mercyfull fader that sayth to you by his prophete in holy wryte:  my chyldren though ye go in &thorn;e fyre drede ye not / for &thorn;e flambe therof shall not trouble you.  As who sayth ye that be crysten people wyllyng to do well, though ye goo in the fyre of trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons drede you not for it shall tourne you to no peryll / but thorugh my goodnes &amp; the merytes of my passyon it shall tourne you to grete proufyte &amp; comforte of your soule. The maner of all these temptacions &amp; &thorn;e remedyes of &thorn;e same sheweth our sauyour Ihesu cryst to his apostle saynt Peter as it appereth in &thorn;e gospel where he sayth thus:  Peter sathanas asketh &amp; desyreth to syfte the as men syfte whete / wherby it appereth well &thorn;at the fende hath no myght ne power to attempte &thorn;e seruauntes of almyghty god but by his suffraunce / &amp; that was euydently knowen by the temptacyons of Iob whome the fende besyfted and tempted.  For &thorn;e more &thorn;at whete is syfted &amp; cast from syde to syde the more clene it is:  Ryght so the more &thorn;at a man or a woman be tempted with the fende ayenst theyr wyll / the more clene they be afore god / wherfore it appereth playnly &thorn;at almyghty god suffreth not his seruauntes to be tempted but for theyr grete wele &amp; profyte yf they purpose them-selfe myghtely to withstande the fendes temptacyon; whiche no man may withstande without the helpe of god, Therfore of his helpe he maketh vs sure lyke as he sayd to peter these wordes:  I haue prayed for the that thy fayth fayle the not.  And therfore that man whiche pacyently is redy to suffre all troubles and dyseases for the loue of his maker almyghty Ihesu not takynge hede of all the fendes mocyons and temptacyons:  that man thrugh the myght and grace of cryst bereth downe and ouercometh the fende / wherby he may be called a vaynquyssher or ouercomer.  And to suche men may be sayd thus:  thou that arte thus tourned to almyghty god by the vertue of pacyence / but yf thou helpe to counseyle &amp; conferme thy bretherne And teche them to suffre as the grace of god hath taught the:  or elles thou arte vnkynde.

And to suche men thus vexed with thoughtes, mocyons &amp; sterynges is behouefull to take the counseyle and techynge of the wyse and dyscrete persones fleynge vtterly theyr owne wylde fantasyes whiche often tymes gretely troubleth them.

And therfore Arystotle sayth that with the more dyffyculte and trauayle vertuous ben goten:  the more they proufyte and encrease in the soule. It was no maystry for saynt Peter whan he sawe almyghty god on the hyll of blysse, to saye / lorde it is good for vs to dwell here.  But afterwarde whan he sawe hym amonges his enemyes cruelly turmented a womans worde fered and put hym in suche drede that he forsoke and denyed his mayster.  But whan thorugh the myght of the holy ghoost he was reconsyled and confermed agayne: than was there no turment in erth that kinge or prynce put vnto hym coude fere hym.  Ryght so yf a man be in perfyte rest and quyetnes of herte / it is no maystry for hym to serue god:  But it is a maystary to hym that is in trauayle and out of quyetnes of herte to serue hym.  Therfore that creature that is tempted or vexed in the seruyce of almyghty god and is in wyll to withstande the sayd temptacyons tyll he after be strengthed and comforted by the holy ghost the fende shall neuer haue power to fere ne put hym in drede / for though it be longe or he fele comforte yet let not hym drede / for our mercyfull sauyour knoweth what tyme comforte is moost nedefull to hym [&] than he fayleth not to gyue it hym.  For somtyme the felynge of swetnes is withdrawen from man or elles he sholde wexe proude and presumtuous or neglygent and recheles in vertuous lyuynge / and therfore it is withdrawen for the best to the helth of his soule / wherfore hardnes and sharpenes sente to a creature is full proufytable to the soule:  as saynt Austyn sayth in techynge vs of the maner of almyghty god that whan a man is feble and newly tourned to hym he gyueth hym peas and swetnes to the entent to stablysshe hym in his lawe and loue / But whan he is stablysshed and sadly grounded in his loue:  than suffreth he hym to be vexed and trauaylled, for two reasons / one is to proue hym and to crowne hym the hyer in the blysse of heuen, An other is to pourge hym of his synnes in this worlde that in noo wyse he be from hym in the euerlastynge worlde.</P></DIV4>

The fyrst is that they be not moche alone.

Almyghty god sayth in the gospell:  yf the entent of a mannes purpose be good the dede is good.  The thyrde remedye is this / that for as moche as the fende laboureth to make a man dredefull and sorye / a man agayne ought to the honour of god and confusyon of the fende to strength hymselfe and be mery though it be ayenst his herte / and drede noothynge the fendes malyce.  For the lesse gladnes that he feleth in hymselfe the more meryte he shall haue whan he so enforceth hymselfe to be mery to the honour of god / and in spyte of his ghoostly enemy the deuyll.  For as holy wryte sayth the holy appostles wente awaye mery &amp; gladde whan the Iues enemyes of god had shamefully beten them. Also a man ought to be gladde for thre causes whan the fende tempteth and turmenteth hym:  The fyrst is that he is troubled by the enemy of god.  The seconde is by suche temptacyons and turmentes the fende sheweth playnly that he is his enemye, and euery man ought to be gladde that goddes enemy is his enemy. And the thyrde is that by suche turmentes a man is not onely released of the paynes in purgatorye but also it maketh hym to wynne euerlastynge blysse.

<HEAD>&para; The seuenth chapytre.</HEAD><P>ALso it is to vnderstonde that our olde enemy the fende is ofte tymes aboute to begyle mannes soule in dyuers and many maners / somtyme he styreth man vnder colour of goodnes to deceyue hym whan he is well dysposed, and specyally in thre thynges whiche I wyll speke of.  One is that though a creature be it man or woman be neuer so well ne soo ofte shryuen / yet the fende maketh them byleue they are not well shryuen / and that he dooth to brynge the soule in heuynes / and so anoyeth &amp; troubleth the poore soule that he maketh hym to forgete what he wolde saye / &amp; therby maketh hym out of rest tyll he be newly shryuen agayne.  But this doth he not for that he wolde that ony were often and well shryuen:  but fully to lette and trouble hym / and to make hym byleue that he were blynded by synne and out of grace wherfore he myght not make hymselfe clene.  The seconde whyle and colour that the fende maketh to withdrawe goodnes is th[is] whan a man or a woman by deuout sterynges of thoughtes haue felynges of contemplacyon and medytacyon as perauenture some solytarye persones hath:  and he maketh them to thynke that to holde &amp; kepe that medytacyons is to theyr moost proufyte to thentent they sholde leue theyr dyuyne

seruyce that they be bounde to / and bryngeth them in suche a combraunce that they wote not whyche waye is best to them to take; and all this he dooth vtterly to deceyue them and cause them to be vnquyet to doo ony of theym bothe.  The thyrde crafte or wyle that he tempteth with is whan a man or a woman gyueth them to honest dysporte to strength themselfe ayenst his false wyles to the comforte of theyr owne soule / than wyll the fende cause theym to haue a conscyence therof / and putteth in to theyr myndes that all suche dysportes is but synne and vanyte, And many tymes bryngeth in to theyr myndes agayne the synnes that they before had done and were confessed of; And all that dooth he to brynge them in to heuynes and dyscomforte to thentent he myght brynge theym to dyspayre.  Neuertheles there be good remedyes in these temptacyons. For as vnto the [first] where the fende whan they be neuer so clene shryuen alwaye putteth them in a doubte that they haue not shryuen them well or elles that there is yet some synne in theym that they perceyue not:  but for all these fantasyes they oughte to take noo fere nor thought but verayly thynke that it is by suggestyon of theyr ghostly enemy that wolde lette theym from rest and peas of theyr soules; and though it be so somtyme that by the meane of suche fantasyes and troubles they forgete some thynge of theyr charge whiche they ought for to haue sayd:  lette hym than be confessed yf he may, and yf he may not conuenyently and lyghtly haue his confessour:  than lette hym haue a full wyll and purpose to be confessed as soone as he can possyble, And in the meane tyme crye god mercy and with a contryte herte aske forgyuenes for his synnes / and than trust fully it is forgyuen hym; for a man is not soo redy to aske forgyuenes and mercy:  but our mercyfull lorde of his grete goodnes is moche more redy to forgyue theym.  And as to the seconde temptacyon wherby the fende wolde lette a man from his dyuyne seruyce that he is bounde vnto vtterly temptynge hym to leue it:  than ought he to be the more dylygent deuoutly &amp; reuerently with good aduysement to saye it; &amp; yf it be so he say alone his seruyce he may whan good thoughtes come or that it wyll please god with swetenes or some hye vysytacyon of the holy ghoost to vysyte and touche hym / than shall it be but well done for to stynte of his seruyce &amp; attende to that medytacyon for a tyme, and after to saye forth / soo that his seruyce that he is bounde vnto be not lefte vnsayd or vndone; and in thus doynge it shall be but lytell lettynge to his seruyce / and he shall fynde grete comforte and ease therin; For though it lette hym for the tyme:  it shall well further hym to the quyckenes of his soule an other tyme.  The thyrde temptacyon is this:  whan a man in due tyme gyueth hymselfe to honest company &amp; dysporte for the strength and comforte of his soule / and the fende putteth in his mynde his synnes tofore done and that he synneth in vayne spendynge the tyme; for all suche temptacions gyue ye no charge for it is the ghostly enemy that so tempteth and troubleth you; For neuertheles ye may be sure that all thynge whiche is truly grounded in god pleaseth his goodnes &amp; nothynge offendeth hym.  Wherfore all goddes seruauntes must grounde them fastely in god / and do by the counseyle of holy chyrche / and yf they soo doo they shall neuer be deceyued / and therfore a man that

And all this the cruell enemy dooth by the meane of puttynge them in a false drede and blynde conscyence that he bryngeth them to.  But the remedy of these and all other temptacyons is to be gouerned by theyr confessour or some other dyscrete persone / and fully put them to theyr rule as afore is sayd and nothynge folowe theyr owne blynde conscyence; For yf they folowe theyr owne conscyence it were a grete pryde / in that he wolde holde his owne wytte better than the true counseyle of holy chyrche.

a louynge moder that is wyse and well taught herselfe she wolde that her chyldren were vertuously and well nortured / and yf she may knowe ony of theym with a defaute she wyll gyue theym a knocke on the heed / and yf the defaute be more she wyll gyue hym a buffet on the cheke / and yf he doo a grete faute she wyll sharpely lasshe hym with a rodde.  And thus dooth god that is our louynge fader from whome all vertue and goodnes cometh.  He whyll that his specyall chosen chyldren be vertuously and well taught in theyr soules / and yf they doo a defaute he wyll knocke them on theyr hedes with some wordes of dyscomforte and dyspleasure / and yf they doo a greter faute he wyll gyue them a buffet with grete sharpenes in sondry maners after the dyuerse condycyon of the defautes / and yf they doo a moche greter trespas than he chastyseth theym moche more sharpely. And all this our blessyd lord doth for the specyall loue he hath vnto vs / for as he sayth hymselfe:  them that he loueth / them he chastyseth.  Now truly, and we toke good hede of these wordes we wolde be gladder of his chastysynge than of all this worldes cherysshynge / and yf we so dyde / all dysease and trouble sholde tourne vs to comforte and Ioye.  But it is full harde thus to doo in the tyme of sharpe heuynes whan a soule standeth naked from all ghoostly and bodely comforte, to take and fynde Ioye in dysease; al be it they that be in suche inwarde dures they must seke in all wayes how they may comforte themselfe in god / and thynke and trust fully that god sente neuer suche chastysynge but that he wolde in longe tyme or in shorte sende comforte wherby they sholde be brought out of these heuynes.  For the prophete sayth many be the trybulacyons of ryghtwysmen / and all suche god shall delyuer.  And though ye fele somtymes sterynges of [dyspayre or of] vnkyndly euyll thoughtes comforte you euer in the goodnes of god / and in the paynefull passyon that his manhode suffredde for you; for the fende tempteth many of the seruauntes of god to dysperacyon and drede of saluacyon / as well worldely men as other ghoostly lyuers / puttynge in worldely mennes myndes the greuousnesse of theyr synnes / and to the ghoostly lyuers he putteth drede &amp; strayte consyence in many more sondry wyses than I can tell:  and full gracyously god hathe comforted theym and brought theym out of theyr errours.  And now I am styred and moued for to tell you of one of them whiche was a squyer that hyght Iohn&macr; Holmes.  A narracyon.  This squyer that I haue named had ben a grete synfull man / and soo at the last thorugh the beholdynge of his grete synnes, And by the temptacyon of the fende, he fell in to dyspayre, soo depely and greuously that he had nygh loste hys mynde.  And thus he was troubled forty dayes that he myght neyther slepe ne ete but wasted awaye and was in the poynte to destroye hymselfe.  But that blessyd gracyous lorde that is soo full of mercy and pyte wolde not haue hym loste.  And vpon a day as he walked in a wood alone an aungell came to hym in fourme of a man and saluted the squyer full goodly / and talked with hym in full curteys maner / sayenge vnto hym:  man thou semest to haue grete heuynes and sorowe / tell me I praye the the cause of thy dysease.  Nay sayd the squyer it is not to be tolde to the.  Yes hardely sayd the aungell / thou wotest not how well I may helpe and remoue thy dysease; For a man beynge in dyscomforte sholde alwaye dyscouer his heuynes to some


<PB N="2: 120">

creature that myght ease hym / for thorugh good counseyle he myght recouer comforte and hele / or in some wyse haue remedye.  The squyer answered the aungell agayne and sayd that he wyste well he neyther coude ne myght helpe hym, And therfore he wolde not tell it to hym.  This sayd squyer wenynge alway that this aungell had ben an erthly man / and dredde that yf he had tolde it vnto hym he sholde haue sayd some worde that sholde vtterly haue greued hym more.  And whan the aungell sawe he wolde by no way tell it vnto hym / he sayd vnto the squyer in this wyse:  Now sythe thou wylte not tell me thy greue I shall tell it the.  Thou arte sayd the aungell in dyspayre of thy saluacyon: but trust me faythfully thou shalte be saued / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes / and surmounteth all synnes.  It is sothe sayd the squyer, I wote wel that god is mercyfull, but he is also ryghtfull and his ryghtwysnes must nedes punysshe synne, And therfore I drede his ryghtfull Iugementes.  The aungell spake vnto hym agayne and tolde hym many grete examples how gracyous and mercyfull our lorde god is to synners.  But the squyer of whome we spake was so depely fallen in dyspayre that he coude take no comforte of ony thinge that he coude saye.  Than the aungell spake agayne to hym in this maner:  O sayd he that thou arte harde of byleue! but wylte thou haue an open shewynge that thou shalte be saued?  Than sayd he to &thorn;e squyer I haue here thre dyce that I wyll throwe / and thou shalte throwe them also / &amp; who that hath moost of the dyce sykerly shall be saued.  A sayd the squyer how myght I in this throwynge of the dyce be certayne of my saluacyon? / &amp; helde it but a Iape; / that notwithstandynge the aungell threwe the dyce and he had on euery of the dyce vpwarde the nombre of syxe.  And he than bad the squyer throwe the dyce.  O than sayd the squyer certaynly that dare I not doo / for I wote well though I caste / more than thou hast caste sholde I not cast ne haue / and yf I had lesse than sholde I fall in ferther dyscomforte. / But so specyally the aungell desyred and spake that at the last the squyer threwe the dyce / and in throwynge by the gracyous myght and power of god euery dyce deuyded in two / &amp; on euery dyce was the nombre of syxe / and so he had the double that the aungell had.  And as he was meruaylynge therupon the aungell vanysshed out of his syght / wherfore he thought veryly than it was an aungell sente from god to brynge hym out of his sorowe / and than he toke moche comforte and Ioye in the grete mercy &amp; goodnes of god in suche maner that all his dredes and sorowes were clene departed / and he became a vertous man and the very seruaunt of god / and lyued blessydly.  And whan he sholde departe from this worlde he deuysed there sholde be a stone layde vpon hym / with these wordes wryten aboute it that foloweth:  Here lyeth Iohn&macr; holmes that of the mercy of god may saye a larges.  I knowe a worshypfull persone that was in the same abbey here in englonde where as he lyeth, that redde the same wordes afore sayd wryten on his tombe.  Now than sythen our mercyfull lorde god sent thus his gracyous comforte to this man that was a worldly synfull man &amp; receyued hym to grace and brought hym out of dyspayre:  There sholde noo man be dyscomforted nor dyspayre of ony temptacyons / for hardely god wyll

In the tyme &thorn;at moost blessyd Domynyck the noble fader and leder moost famouse of &thorn;e ordre of prechers / preched throughout the worlde in many regyons and exhorted incessauntly &thorn;e people to the laude and prayse of &thorn;e blessyd marye vyrgyn vndefyled / &amp; to her angelyke confraternyte:  It fortuned hym to preche at Rome in the audyence of the grete prelates of the worlde, and shewed by fygures and examples this blessyd vyrgyn to be saluted moost specyally by her psalter.

grete wonders.  To whome he sayd:  O faythfull and true lordes and other true louers of the fayth: here this synguler holsome sayenge to you all / that ye may veryly knowe those thynges whiche I haue spoken to be true:  Take the psalter of this blessyd vyrgyne / and in sayenge it: call deuoutedly vnto your remembraunce the passyon of cryste:  Thus I shewe vnto you that ye shall haue in experyence the spyryte of god.  Truely soo greate a flamble may not stonde in ony place without makynge hote, Neyther soo grete lyghte without gyuynge lyght / nor soo godly a medycyne without the vertue of makynge hole.  What sholde I saye more? all the people gaue audyence and in maner astonyed: they meruaylled of his godly wordes / [&] many persones not onely of the comyn people but also of grete prelates of the chyrche as reuerende cardynalles and many honourable bysshoppes toke vpon them to saye this psalter of our lady / to thentent they myght gete some grace of almyghty god.  A meruayllous thynge: The cyte beynge in trouble / dyuerse multyplycacyon of prayers was [made] amonges the people in euery state or degree.  For truly thou myght se bothe mornynge / euenynge / and at myddaye men and women euerywhere berynge the psalter of our lady.  Cardynalles whiche be named the pyllers of the worlde and bysshoppes shamed not to bere in theyr handes &amp; at theyr gyrdelles these soo grete tokens of the godhede and of our fayth veryly to be byleued.  Truely by the myracles of our lady shewed by saynt Domynyck they doubted not but in excercysynge of this psalter goddes helpe to be redy at all tymes.  What more? All that dyde assaye this psalter perceyued some knowlege of the pyte of god. And amonges all I shall shewe this wonder or myracle onely folowynge.
</P><P>At Rome was a certayne mysdysposed woman of her body, moost famouse aboue all other lyke dysposed / in beaute / eloquence / apparayle / and worldly gladnes / whiche fortuned gracyously to haue the psalter of our lady by thaduyse of holy saynt Domynyk / whiche she hydde vnder her kyrtell and sayd it many tymes on the daye.  But alas she neuertheles vsed the vnlawfull flesshely pleasure and vnclennes of her body aboue all other / more men resorted to her than to ony other woman of suche vayne dysposycyon.  This woman, named fayre Katheryne for the incomperable beaute of her body, contynued in her mysse-lyuynge / and ones on the day at the leest she dyde vysyte the chyrche sayenge the psalter of our lady / and thus was her medytacyon and thought:  The fyrst fyfty she sayd for the infancye of cryst in the whiche he bare all his passyon to come / and yf it were not at that tyme in execucyon / neuertheles it was in his entent and mynde.  The seconde fyfty she sayd for crystes passyon exhybyte and done ryally lyke as he suffred in his manhode.  The thyrde fyfty she sayd for the passyon of cryste as it was in his godhede / not bycause the godhede as the godhede myght suffre / but bycause this infynyte godhede loued so moche the nature of man / that yf it had ben mortall it sholde haue suffred deth; Therfore bycause the eternall wysdome of god in hymselfe myght not dye for vs / he toke vpon hym our manhode / whiche his wyll was sholde suffre passyon &amp; dye for all mankynde.  And as this fayre Katheryne thus contynued in prayenge / it happened on a season as she wente aboute Rome wandrynge after her olde

maner / a meruayllous fayre man mette her &amp; sayd:  Heyle Katheryne / why stondest thou here / hast thou noo dwellynge place?  To whome she answered sayenge:  Syr I haue a dwellynge place and euery thynge in it ordered to the best and goodlyest maner.  To whome he sayd:  This nyghte wyll I soupe with the.  She answered:  I graunt with all myne herte / and what so euer thou wylte haue I shall gladly prepare.  Thus goynge hande in hande they came vnto her hous where as were many wenches of lyke dysposycyon.  Souper was prepared and this vnknowen geste sate with fayre Katheryne / the one dranke to the other.  But euery thynge that this straunge geste touched / were it drynke or other thynge lyke / anone turned in to blody colour, with a meruayllous excellent smell &amp; swete sauour.  She meruaylynge sayd to hym:  Syr what arte thou / eyther it is not well with me elles thou arter very meruaylous / for euery thinge that thou touchest is anone made of blody colour.  And he answered sayenge:  Knowest thou not that a crysten man neyther eteth nor drynketh but that is dyed or coloured with the blode of cryste.  Thus this woman was meruayllously abasshed of this straunger / soo moche that she fered for to touche hym.  Notwithstondynge she sayd:  Syr I well perceyue by your countenaunce that ye be a man of grete reuerence:  I beseche you who be ye / and from whens come ye?  To whome he sayd:  Whan we be togyder in thy chaumbre / I shall shewe the all thyn askynges.  And thus lefte in doubte of the mater: she made redy the chaumbre.  This woman Katheryne wente fyrst to bedde / &amp; desyred the straunger to come to bedde to her.  A wonderful thynge and suche one as in maner neuer was herde of ony creature:  Sodeynly this straunger chaunged hymselfe in to the shappe of a lytell chylde / bare vpon his heed a crowne of thorne / vpon his sholder a crosse / and tokens of his passyon with innumerable woundes vpon all his body / and sayd vnto Katheryne:  O Katheryne now leue thy folysshenes.  Beholde / now thou seest the passyon of Cryste veryly as it was in his infancye for the whiche thou sayd the fyrst fyfty of thy psalter.  I shewe vnto the / that from the fyrste houre of my concepcyon vnto my deth I bare contynually this payne in myne herte / whiche for thy sake was soo grete that yf euery lytell pece or stone of grauell in &thorn;e see were a chylde and euery one of them had as moche payne as euer suffred al the men in the worlde at theyr deth: yet all they togyder suffre not so grete payne as I suffred for the.  This woman was sore abasshed seynge and herynge this wonder.  And anone agayne he was tourned in to the lykenes of a man, euen after the same fourme whiche he had the tyme of his passyon ryall, And sayde:  Doughter beholde now thou seest how grete paynes I suffered for the / whiche dooth excede all the paynes of helle / for my power of suffrynge is of god and not of man.  And my passyon was so grete that yf it had ben deuyded amonge all creatures of the worlde / they sholde all haue dyed or ben dystroyed.  After this sey[i]nge he chaunged hymselfe in to the clerenes of the sonne / notwithstandynge the tokens of his passyon remaynynge also gloryously/ in all his woundes were sene al and infynyte creatures of the worlde for compassyon of the same / and he sayd vnto her:</P>

<PB N="2: 126">
<P>BEholde / take hede / now thou seest what I suffred in my godhede for thyn helth; syth all thynges be in me and I in euery thynge / in all these I se the / I loue the / &amp; in them all I am redy to suffre eternally the payne for thy soules helth whiche thou seest, for my loue is infynyte (after saynt Dyonyse) and all thynges in me be infynyte as the same Dyonyse sheweth.  Therfore knowe the mekenes of god / and call to mynde the threfolde passyon of cryste / for the whiche thou sayd thryse fyfty Aues / &amp; fyftene Pater nosters, And here after amende thyselfe / that as thou were before the example of all malyce and vnclene lyuynge / soo now from this tyme forwarde [&thorn;ou] lyue in suche maner that thou may be to all other a myrrour of purete and clennes.  I do not appere to the for thy merytes but onely for an example of penaunce / and bycause thy brethren and systers of myn vndefyled moders fraternyte haue prayed for the / that by thy conuersacyon many sholde be conuerted and be the chyldren of god / lyke as before innumerable were made the chyldren of the deuyll by thy wyckednes.
</P><P>What more?  This vysyon vanysshed awaye.  It was also vnfayned / for the woman afterwarde felte in her handes and fete the sorowe of crystes passyon / and in other partes of her body.  Therfore she rose from synne &amp; toke her to penaunce / and on the morowe after made her confessyon to saynt Domynyk; to whome he enioyned in penaunce to saye the psalter of the blessyd vyrgyn Marye as she was wonte to doo, and to be one of her fraternyte / whyche she had not before in dede but onely in purpose and entent as it is afore sayd; where it is to be noted how moche this sayd fraternyte is worth to them whiche haue it in dede / syth it was soo grete valure to this woman hauynge it but in purpose. [&] whyles that she prayed deuoutely vnto this vyrgyn Marye / the same blessyd lady appered to her with saynt Katheryne, sayenge to her:  Doughter beholde / take hede / thou hast synned moche: therfore thou must suffre grete penaunce; for this cause take in penaunce euery daye thre dyscyplynes or thre correccyons / wherof euery one shall be of .lv. strokes whiche make a penytencyall psalter. She sayd also / it shall not alwaye nede to haue a rodde / but prycke the with thy nayles / or pynche thy flesshe in euery place.  Thou mayst at all tymes doo this penaunce ayenst euery wycked temptacyon and for to obteyne all goodnes / and this is a royall, preuy penaunce and naturall, It may be called the quene of all penaunces.  This woman herde all these wordes and fulfylled them in dede. And as she was thus dayly penytent: vpon a tyme saynt Domynyk auaunced by the power of god sawe in the nyght a wonderfull thynge to all the worlde.  He perceyued that from the hous of this same Katheryne yssued out .lv. flodes from the membres of a lytell chyld / ewhiche flodes descended to hell, in whose comynge the soules, there to be purged, were gretely comforted.  O how grete and Ioyfull noyses made they than: how many blessynge gaue they vnto this sayd Katheryne; veryly the erth sounded agayne to theyr voyces for Ioye.  There were soules delyuered / comforted / made hole &amp; excluded from theyr paynes, by the medytacyon that Katheryne had of crystes passyon in his chyldehode.  She was alwaye aboute to applye it to the comforte of all true crysten soules departed out of this worlde.  O meruaylous thynge:  After this saynt Domynyk sawe a man entre


<PB N="2: 127">

in to Katheryns chaumbre / &amp; from .v. [woundes] of his body yssewed out .lv. [fountaynes] whiche nourysshed and watred all the chyrche mylytante / and also this present worlde; trees and plantes dyde burgyn / byrdes and fysshes were quyckened / true crysten people were bathed in those flodes.  O how grete swetenes was there and how grete worldly gladnes.  All creatures blessyd this woman Katheryne and prayed for her to almyghty god maker of all thynges. And these two meruaylles were shewed for the fyrst fyfty and the seconde.  And where as this penytent Katheryne began the thyrde fyfty of her psalter, Saynt Domynyk sawe a meruaylous grete gyaunt clerer than the lyght / of whome yssewed out fyue fountaynes / of the fyue fountaynes sprange fyfty flodes whiche neyther descended to therth / nor to hell / but meruayllously ascended togyder vnto heuen, And by them all heuenly paradyse was watred.  Theyr swetenes was so grete that the aungelles and holy sayntes dyde drynke of theym / gyuynge grete thankes to almyghty god.  Whan saynt Domynyck sawe all these meruaylles as Thomas of the temple wryteth: he meruaylled gretly why they sholde be shewed and done in the hous of so grete a synner.  To whome marye the vyrgyn appered and sayd:  O my frende Domynyk why doost thou meruayle in suche causes? Knowest thou not I am a frende to all synners and that the mekenes of god is in me?  It was my wyll to shewe these vysyons to the of this my doughter that thou sholde preche them to the worlde / for this entent that no crysten persone be theyr synnes neuer so grete sholde dyspayre in ony condycyon / but alwaye trust in god and his mercy / and namely they that wyll flee vnder my proteccyon with this woman Katheryne.  The holy vyrgyn and martyr saynt Katheryne socoured her very moche whiche alwaye she loued and serued with some prayer from her yonge aege / for the congruence of the name.  More ouer the blessyd moder of god sayd:  O Domynyk thou haste sene these meruaylles:  Here now and preche that I soo holy and meke shall saye.  Shewe that I haue purchased of my sone to all suche as sayth my psalter and are of my fraternyte / they shall haue the same excellence whiche the sayd Katheryne hath.  &amp; though they can not se it in this worlde, lykewyse as men can not se god / his aungelles / the deuylles / neyther theyr merytes and vertues in this lyfe, Also they can not se the vertue of a precyous stone nor of the sterres: therfore the knowledge of heuenly thynges must be moche ferther from them; Notwithstondynge they shall beholde this excellence after theyr deth.  Therfore Domynyk be of good comforte [&] preche my psalter &amp; my fraternyte / for vnto all suche as hath them I haue purchased not onely to se this excellence / but also to haue it eternally in possessyon.  What sholde I saye more?  Saynt Domynyk gaue thankes to almyghty god for his grete mercy.  And this Katheryne made herselfe a recluse [&] she dystrybuted her goddes to the poore people.  Whiche afterwarde was of so grete holynes that many very holy persones came vnto her bycause of her godly reuelacyons.  To whome appered our lorde Ihesu .C. dayes &amp; fyfty before her departynge out of this lyfe shewynge the tyme of her deth / whiche afterwarde departed out of this lyfe very holy.  Thre holy vyrgyns one named Iohanne / an other Martha / the thyrde Lucya sawe her soule departe from the body bryghter than the sonne /

<P>The firste prophet of tribulacion is vnderstond &thorn;at it is a trew socoure of help sent frome god to delyuer the soule fro &thorn;e handis of his enemyes, whiche enemyes ben &thorn;ese: preuy suggestions of &thorn;e fende &thorn;at cruel enemy, ffalse ioyes

&amp; richesse of the world &thorn;at disseiuable enemy, vnclene lustis of the fflessh &thorn;at homly enemy.  Thes enemyes sleen &thorn;e soule, and so mych &thorn;e more (perl)osly, &thorn;at &thorn;ei disseiuen it with false feyned frendshyp and so preuyly.  The which ben figured bi Ioas, IIo Regum .XX., that feyned hym frend to Amas holdynge hyme by &thorn;e chyne as he wold haue kyssed hyme, and so with his swerd in &thorn;at oder hond preuyly stiked hyme.  Vpone &thorn;is sei&thorn;e seint Gregor: Yf euery fortune is for to be drad, moch more is for to be drad prosperite &thorn;an aduersite&mdash;as schewe&thorn; opynly.  And note wel &thorn;at god ordeyneth all &thorn;ingis in tribulacion to [&thorn;e] delyueraunce of his seruauntis, as he behoti&thorn;e be &thorn;e prophet Dauid, seying &thorn;us: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Cum ipso sum in tribulacione, eripiam eum &amp; glorificabo eum,</FOREIGN> I am with hym in tribulacion, I schal delyuer hym of tribulacion, and I schal glorifye hym for tribulacion.  For als much &thorn;an as god is with vs in tribulacion, we schal suffre it paciently and gladly, for &thorn;e more &thorn;at tribulacion groweth to &thorn;e, the more nere god nei&yogh;hith to &thorn;e, as &thorn;e prophet seith:<FOREIGN
LANG="LAT"> Iuxta est dominus hijs qui tribulato sunt corde, &amp; humiles spiritu saluabit,</FOREIGN> Oure lord is faste-by to hem &thorn;at ben in tribulacion of herte, and he schal saue hem &thorn;at ben meke of spirite.  Therfor if the peyne of tribulacion make the heuy and greuyth the, &thorn;e my&yogh;t and the mercy of god thy sauioure &thorn;at is with the in tribulacion, schall inwardly comfort the.  But now perauenture &thorn;ou my&yogh;test answere &amp; sey thus: 'The bitter payne ofe tribulacion I fele wel, but swettnesse of his fellowshyp I fele none; ffor if he schewed to me the present swetnesse of hy[s] myrth as he doth the bitternesse of tribulacion, I schuld suffer it gladly'.  Also perauenture thow woldist seye that afore tribulacion thow felist more swetnesse in god &thorn;an &thorn;ou dedist whan &thorn;ou were in tribulacion.  Here-to may be answered, &thorn;at &thorn;e frendshipe of god in tribulacion is vnder-stond in twey maners.  First: as tribulacion encresith, so god multiplieth grace &amp; vertu for to suffre tribulacion paciently &amp; gladly.  Example: as lordis send socoure and helpe to comforte hyr seruauntis &thorn;at be in castellis besegid of her enemyes, ry&yogh;t so oure lord god sendi&thorn;e comfort of grace to soules &thorn;at ben be-segid with temptacions &amp; tribulacions.  The secund maner of the fellowschype of god in tribulacion may be vnderstonde by the comforte &thorn;at he sendith hem &thorn;at bene in tribulacion; as the apostil seithe, I Cor. IIo: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Sicut habundant passiones Christi in nobis, ita habundat consolacio nostra,</FOREIGN> As the passion of Criste encresith in us, so encresith oure comforte.  Cristis passions encresyne in us when thei be sent fro hym and we to [&thorn;e] lyknesse of hym mekely &amp; paciently suffer hem as goddis seruauntis, and not as mansleers and thevis, whiche hane deseruid &thorn;at &thorn;ei sufferne.  And vnderstond well, &thorn;at comforte of grace in tribulacion is for he schulde dred god and trist in hym to be delyuerde; as we rede in the boke of holy fader seint Anton, how he after many gret spirituall temptacions was troublyd of fendis, bodyly betone and woundid all hys body, so &thorn;at whan his seruaunt cam to viset hym he found hyme lying dede &amp; so he toke hym vp and bare hym to the next towne where he watched tyll abow&yogh;t mydny&yogh;t; and &thorn;an by the will ofe god he releued and bad his seruaunt preuyly, all other sclepyng, bere hym a&yogh;en; and so he did.  And whan he was brou&yogh;t ayen thedir so feble &thorn;at he my&yogh;t not stonde, but sittynge vp he seid &thorn;us: 'Where bene ye euill spiritis, wicked feendis? lo I am here be &thorn;e my&yogh;t of god redy to withstond all youre malice'.  &amp; after &thorn;es and many [othir] wonderfull temptacions: oure lord appered to hym in wonderful ly&yogh;t &amp; comfortable.  To whom hooly Antone seid: 'A lord Ihesu, where hast &thorn;ou bene? good lord, where hast &thorn;ou be so longe fro me in tribulacion?'  And oure lord answered and seyd: 'here with the, beholdynge thi fyghtynge, redy to reward the and comforte the after thi uictory, as I am wont to do for my chosin childerne'.  For wit &thorn;ou well &thorn;at comforte oweth not to com, tyl that a place be rayed therto by tribulacion.  Also we rede of Sare, the

<P>The secund prophet of tribulacion is &thorn;at it stoppith the malice of the fend; for he is a-ferd to tempt &thorn;e soule &thorn;at is in tribulacion, for he dredith hym to be ouercome or ellis refused.  &amp; &thorn;at is figured by the frendis of Iobe, where it is seyd, Iob. IIo: <FOREIGN

Of which one commyth to mynde.  Abbot Sisoy after meke sofferrynge of tribulacions &amp; desesis, a litill to-fore the soule schuld passe from the body, he seyd: 'brethern, bene(!) glad, lo holy Anton commyth to us'; &amp; sone after he seyd: 'lo here commyth the worshypful company of prophetis'; and the thrid tyme he seid: 'now commyne the holy apostillis'; and as it semed to hem &thorn;at stodyne abou&yogh;t he spake with hem; and &thorn;en &thorn;ei prayeden [hym] &thorn;at he schuld tel hem with whom &thorn;at he spake, and he answerid and seid: 'with holy angels &thorn;at commyn to take my soule; and I prayed hem to byd[e] a while, &thorn;at I schuld suffre more pennaunce'; and &thorn;ese wordis I-seyd, &thorn;e spirit passeth with gret ly&yogh;t, all &thorn;ei felynge a wonderfull swete sauoure.

<HEAD> Of the thrid prophet of tribulacion. <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Capitulum tercium.</FOREIGN></HEAD>
<P>The thrid prophet of tribulacion is &thorn;at it purgi&thorn;e the soule.  But it is to wit &thorn;at ther bene v. maner of materiall purgyngis.  On is purgynge of mannys body for corrupcion of humoris wicked; &amp; &thorn;at is in two maners: one ys be medicinable drynkys, a nother be crafty blood-lettynge.  The secund purgynge ys of metal, as gold be &thorn;e fire, &amp; iron be the fyle.  The thrid purgynge is of trees, as cuttynge of vynes, and voydynge of onfrutfull branches.  The fourth purgynge is of corne, as betyng or thresshyng with a flayle.  The fyfte purgynge is of grapis, &amp; that is by a pressoure.  One &thorn;us many maners god doth purge the soule by tribulacions.  For as the body is purged by medicinalle drinkis of euell humoris, ryght so is the soule made clene by tribulacions sent from the souereyne leche oure lord god of veyne affeccions and euell maners; for seynt Gregor seyth:<FOREIGN
LANG="LAT"> Mali humores sunt mali mores,</FOREIGN> Euel humoris bene euel maners.  Drinke &thorn;is medicyne of tribulacion sent to the fro god, for he is a wise leche and knoweth all &thorn;i preuy syknesse &amp; how much &thorn;ou maist suffre and how much &thorn;ou nediste, for he sendi&thorn;e the no thynge but &thorn;at &thorn;at is profitable to the.  And he ha&thorn;e tasted and assayed and drunke afore the, not for hym-selfe but for &thorn;i purgynge, he suffred &thorn;e passione of deth; wherof he seyd to the apostellis Iohn&macr; and Iamys, Mat. xxo: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Potestis bibere calicem quem ego bibiturus sum,</FOREIGN> Mow ye drynke &thorn;e passione &thorn;at I schal drynke?  &THORN;an sith this wise lech hath dronke this medicyn for &thorn;i loue, drynke &thorn;ou therof with-oute drede, for it is holsom.  This drynke thirsted the prophet Dauid whene he seid: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen domini inuocabo,</FOREIGN> I schal take the holsome passione of tribulacion.  And if &thorn;e &thorn;inke it bitter, clepe &thorn;i lord god vnto &thorn;i helpe as he seid: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione,</FOREIGN> Lord god graunt us helpe of tribulacion.  And as a purgacion schuld be receyued hastyly with-oute ouer-much tastynge or longe tarryng, so schuld tribulacion be acceptid wilfullye with-out argumentis of disputynge or rebellyone or grucchynge.  But now be wel ware: for as some-tyme &thorn;e prophet of the medicyne is letti[d] and worchith the contrary to corrupcion, not for the defaute of &thorn;e medcyne, but for &thorn;e euel disposicion of hym &thorn;at receyueth hit, so in the same wise the prophet of tribulacion is lettid of purgacion and doth the contrary, for it is begynnynge of payne, after which foloweth euerlastynge dampnacion; as we reden of kyng Pharo kynge of Egipt, for the more &thorn;at he was visettid by tribulacion, the more his rebellious herte encresyd in to his dampnacion.  The secund purgacion of mannys body for euel humoris is by crafty blood-lettynge, and that is of two maners, as by openynge [of &thorn;e veyne, or els by boxynge or ventusynge.  Openynge of the veyne] is properyd to confession, and boxynge or ventusyng, to tribulacion.  And not[e] wele, ryght as foule blode corruptith the body, so syn which is called in holy writ 'blood' defouleth the soule.  The veyne be the which blod or syne ys voidid oute, is the mouth, as it is seyd Prouerb. x: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Vena vite os iusti; quia iustus in principio accusator est sui,</FOREIGN> The mouth of a ry&yogh;tful man is the veyne of lijf; for the ryghfull man in the begynnynge accuseth hym-selfe, &thorn;at is to sey, be confession.  Also note that as a man oweth by this veyne to voyde oute wicked blood for the purgynge of his body, and kepe his good blood for his norisshynge, ryght so in confession he oweth by his mouthe to shew all his synnes, and with-hold and kepe preue all his good dedis for fere of lesynge; for good [dedis] schewed in

confession by veyneglory or avauntynge, turnyn fro vertu vnto vicis for defaute of wise kepyng, as we redyne of the pharase that seyd, Luc.  XVIIIo:<FOREIGN
LANG="LAT"> Gracias ago tibi domine quia non sum sicut ceteri hominum, raptores, adulteri, uelut eciam hic publicanus; Ieiuno bis in sabbato, decimas do omnium que possideo:</FOREIGN> Lord I &thorn;anke &thorn;e for I am not lyke as other men, robbers and auoutrers, also not lyke this publycan; I fast twise in a weke, I paye tythes of all &thorn;at I haue.  Lo here &thorn;ou maist vnderstond by this pharase a false feyned and a prowd confession.  <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Sed publicanus a longe stans noluit oculos ad celum leuare, sed percuciebat pectus [suum] dicens Deus propicius esto michi peccatori:</FOREIGN> But the publican stondynge a-ferre behynde, holdynge hym-selfe vnworthi, wold not lyfte up his &yogh;ien to heuen, but he smote his herte and seyde God haue merci on me synner; and so this publican yode thens iustified, or made ryght, by his verry meke confessione.  To this acordith the prophet Dauid where he seith thus: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Dixi confitebor aduersum me iniusticiam meam domino, &amp; tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei:</FOREIGN> I schall knowlege [by] meke confession ayence my-silfe to my lord myn vnry&yogh;twisnes, and &thorn;ou haste for&yogh;euen the wickidnesse of my synne.  &para; Boxynge or ventusyng, a-cordyth to tribulacion; for als many desesis as god sendith to the in tribulacion, so many remedies he ordeynith for thi purgacion.  But note wel as it is nedeful afore ventusynge, the flessh to be het and clensid, for &thorn;an the smytynge of the blood-yryne may be suffred the more esily; so it is spedful afore tribulacion &thorn;at the hert be hett with parfite loue and charite, &thorn;at temptacion of tribulacion may be suffred the more paciently and gladly.  In figure here-of the holygoste cam downe to the apostilys in lyknesse of fire, bi whome thei were so strengthid and comforted &thorn;at afterward &thorn;ei werene gladd and yedyn Ioyinge for &thorn;ei were maade worthi to suffer tribulacion, angre and repreue for the name of Ihesu, the which afore &thorn;at tyme were so dredful &thorn;at &thorn;ei fleddyn aweye fro hym and som forsokun [hym], as Petir&mdash;&thorn;at was prince of the apostilles&mdash;for fere of a woman swore &thorn;at he knew hym not, the which after [&thorn;e] commynge of the holygoste dred not the cruell turment of Nero the emperour, but paciently and gladly suffred to be crucified and dede.  The secund maner of materyall purgacion is of metallis, as gold be fyre, and irone by file.  For ryght as fire departith gold from other metallis, and purgith hym of ruste and fylth, and maki&thorn;e hire faire and clene: so tribulacion departith the soule of his aduersaries, and clensith hym of the filth of synnes, and it makith hym to god lovely and acceptable; and therfor it is seyd Sapienc.  Vo: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Tamquam aurum in fornace probauit electos dominus, et quasi holocausta hostii accepit illos, &amp; in tempore erit respectus illorum,</FOREIGN> Oure lord hath preued his chosen men by tribulacion as gold is preued in the fornaise, and he hath accepted hem as sacrifice of offrynge, &amp; in tyme of reward &thorn;at schuld be hold(!).  With this fire of tribulacion was Iob preved when he seyd, Iobe XXIIIo: <FOREIGN

And note &thorn;at amonge all metallis gold is moste preciouse, and leed is leste of price, &amp; yet neuertheles gold is not purged with-oute leed, for leed draweth with hym in the forneis the filthes of gold.  On the same maner chosine soules [the whiche be likned to gold], bene purged by dampned soules the which be likened to leed; wherof Salomon seith: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Stultus seruiet sapienti,</FOREIGN> The fole schal serue to the wise man&mdash;&thorn;at is to seye, euell men schal serue to purge good men by tribulacion.  &para; Also Iron is purged bi the file of ruste, and made schynyng and bry&yogh;t: so is the soule purged by tribulacion from vnclennesse &amp; comforted with gostly ly&yogh;t.  And as a knyfe &thorn;at is not vsed, abydynge in the sheth draweth ruste: so doth the soule with-oute excersise of tribulacion, desireth vnclene luste; as we redyne of Dauid, IIo Reg. IIo, [&thorn;at] whan he was with-owt tribulacion of werrynge with his enemyes, fell into auoutrye with the wife of Vry &thorn;at wor&thorn;i kny&yogh;t, &amp; after into homicide or manslau&yogh;ter.  &THORN;erfor sei&thorn;e &thorn;e prophet Ieremye: <FOREIGN

<OPENER>Here . . begynneth a tretyse of gostly batayle.</OPENER><P>BRother or sustere that desyrest to come to the endeles blysse that mankynde was ordeyned to in hys fyrst creacion, whyche oure fadere Adame lost thorow brekyng off [the] commaundement off oure lorde gode, and commyttede to endeles trauayle, woo and payne, and alle mankynde in hym, that neuer shulde haue hade ende, ne hade oure lorde off hys endeles mercy becomyne mane; in the whyche manhode he suffrede gret peynes, trybulacions and sclaunders, reproues and shamefulle dethe vpone the rode-tree, the whyche was for pure lofe and conpassyone that he hade in mannes soule, and made aseeth to the fader in heuyne for the gylt off mankynde.  Also oure gracyous [lord] Cryste Ihesu, that ys bothe gode and mane, hath grauntede to alle tho that kepe hys commaundementis, louene vertew and hatyne syne, the pardone off hys mercyfulle redempcion, and there-ayens [to] alle tho that brekyne hys commaundementis and wolle nat restreyne hem fro synne and wyckydnes but enforse hem to lyfe in lustis and lykyngis and to fulfylle the apetytis off her fleysshly desyres, endeles peyne: and therfore, yeff thow wolt come to endeles blesse and avoyde frome endeles peyne, the be-houeth to haue in mynde that oure lord seyth by holy Iob: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Milicia est vita hominis super terram,</FOREIGN> Iob 8<HI REND="sup">o</HI>, that ys: Alle mannes lyfe vpone erthe ys but fygthynge and knygthode ayenst gostly enemyes.  These enemyes bene the fende, the worlde, and the flessh.  And therfore the holy gost techeth vs in [the] booke of Wysdome, seying to eche mane thus: 'Son, when thow be-gynnest to serue gode, loke thow stande styfly in rygthwysnes and drede, and make redy thy soule to with-stonde the dysceytis off the fende'.  Also seynt Powle byddeth you to clothe yow in trewe armoures of gode, that ye mowe myghtyly with-stande the temptacions of oure enemyes.  For mannes body ys [as] a clothe in the whyche the soule ys clothede.</P><P>Horse.  Also hit ys lykenede to an horse; for lyke as ane horse welle-taughte beryth hys mastere ouer many peryllys and saueth hym fro perysshyng, so the body welle-rewled bereth the soule ouer many peryllys of thys wrecched worlde. And lyke as ther longeth many thyngis to the horse thorow the whych hys mastere may sytte sadly and nat falle, and as there may noo mane fy&yogh;te ayenst hys enemy but yef hys horse be meke and mylde, ryght so the sowle may nat fyghte ayenst the deceytis off the fende but yef the body by meke and mylde; ffor yeff the body lyfe in lustis and lykyngis at hys oune wylle, hit ys lyke to peryssh the soule in the fyre off helle, for holy wrytte seyth: 'he that noryssheth hys body delycatly and lustyly, shalle fynde hym rebelle whene he leste weneth'. For assone as a mane wolle lyfe wysely after the lawes of gode and to fle the false lustes off thys worlde and to withstonde fflesshely desyres and to bowe hym vnder the yooke off goddys lawe, than begynneth hys enemyes to compasse hym with wyles and wrenches, to make hyme ouerthrowe frome the blysse that he ys ordeynede to, in to the horryble pytte off helle; wherffore hit ys behouefulle that the body be buxome and mylde to the soule in thys gostly batayle, yeff he shalle haue victory off hys enemyes.  For yeff the body and the sowle be welle accordede to-gydere and eche helpe othere in thys gostly batayle, thane shalle the enemyes soone fflee, ffor holy wryte seyeth: 'Withstande the ffende and he shalle flee fro the'.  But hit were grete ffoly for any mane to fyghte apone ane horse vnbrydelyde: ffor yeff he be wylde and off euylle condycions, he ys lyke to be hys masters confusyone and to cast hym in to the handes off hys enemyes, and therfore hit ys nedeffulle that he be brydelyde.  And yeff he be

wylde and off euylle condycions, than nedeth the brydelle to be heuy and sumdele sharpe, to restrayne hyme from hys wyckyde lustys; and yef he be buxome and mylde, thane nedyth the brydelle to be softe and smothe.</P>
<P>Brydylle.  Thys brydylle ys clepede Abstinence, with the whyche the fflessh shalle be refraynede from flesshly desires and worldely affecciouns to the loue off gode and heuynly desyres: for he ys wylde and wyllfulle, and lothe to bowe to goodnes, and therfore with thys brydelle thou must refreyne hyme tylle he be meke and mylde to the sowle.  And yeff [he] be wylde in flesshly lustis |and in worldely worschyppys, thane brydelle hym with sharpe abstynence, bothe with fastyng and wakyng and with honest occupacion doyng; for yeff thow on hym wolle fyghte and late hym lyfe after hys desyre, truste sekyrly that thow shalt be ouercome. And ther[to] refreyne hyme discretely with abstynence, so that the kynde be kepte in strengthe; for ellys he xalle fayle the att nede and [make &thorn;e] lese the victory off thys gloryous batayle.
</P><P>Reynes.  The two reynes off thys brydelle shullene be two partyes off temperaunce: that ys to say, neythere to moche nere to lytelle, knytte to-gedyr by the knot off discrecione.  And holde the reynes euene to-gedyre by the knotte that none passe othere; ffor yeff any of hem be owte off mesure, hit wylle make thy horse to glyde a-syde, and so to lese the rygth waye of that gloryous blysse whyche mankynde was ordeyned to in hys furst creacion.
</P><P>That oone Reyene.  That one reyne ys to large whane thow suffrest thy flessh to haue to moche hys wylle in etyng and drynkyng, in slepyng, in spekyng, in veyne talys tellyng other in rebaudy, in lesyngis, in sweryng or any other vnprofytable talkyng.  Also hit ys to large yeff thow noryssh hit delycately in ouer-moche ease off softe lying, goyng, other syttyng, or in any othere thyng doyng that thow dost to fulfylle the [vnleful] desyres off thy flessh, and nat rewlede in mesure as reasone asketh.  For euery thoughte and euery worde and euery dede that a mane doth whyche ys nat pryncypally done in the worschyp off gode and to helpe and furtheryng off hys euy[n]crystene dewly and rygthfully as charyte asketh, hyt ys veyne, and synne, other venyalle or dedely synne, off whyche thow shalt yeue a ffulle streyte rekenyng at the dredeffulle day off dome, but yeff hit be amendyde in thys lyff here with sorow off herte and with confessyone and satisfaction makyng.
</P><P>That other Reyne.  That other ys to streyte whene thow art to sterne ayenst thyne oune fleyssh, in with-drawyng that reasone wolde that he hadde bothe in mete and drynke &amp; slepe, or [by] any other vnresonable abstynence, where-thorow hit ys so ffebylle that hit may nat serue gode durably with feruent herte, with myghty desyre and with parfyte loue, but hit ys so ffebylle that hit may neythere pray ne werke ner speke as hit oughte, but lyeth stylle as a vnresonable beste with grete fantasyes and vnclene thoughtis be cause off ydelnes off the hede or for febylnes off the body; and so yeff thow be ouersterne agayne thy fflessh, hit may lette the in [this] gostly batayle.  And therfore susteyne thy body dyscretely, so that he be neyther to wylde ne to febylle, but of euene strengthe. For yeff thow suffre hyme to haue alle hys fulle lykyngis and desyres, thane he that shulde be thy beste ffrende wolle be thy fulle enemy; and yeff thow with-drawe from hyme that he ougth for to haue in susteynyng hys kynde by reasone, than thow dystroyest hys mygth, where-throwe he may nat helpe the to haue the victorye off thyne enemyes, but [is] rather lykely to be thy confusyone.
</P><P>A Sadylle.  Also thy horse be-houeth to haue a sadylle, that thow may sytte the more sadly and semely to othere mennes sygth.  Thys sadylle ys Pacience and Mekenesse; that ys to say, thow muste be pacient in aduersyte, both in sclaunders and reproues, in sekenes, in temptacion, in tribulacions, and in alle aduersytees, and so mekely resceue heme with dewe thankyngis to gode off hys gracyous vysytacions, thynkyng that thow were moche more worthy for thy grete offensys ande trespases that thow hast doone ayenst hyme.  Also what-so-euer

<PB N="2: 423">

thow doo, thynke or speke, that hit be do with goode avysement, [&] wysely to thynke on the begynnyng and on the endyng; and that hit be doo swetely, benygnely and with mylde chere, and greue the nat in no wyse.  And [&thorn;off] thy flessh be grogyng thorow freelte off hys oune corrupcion that he hath in hys oune kynde, yet kepe mekenes in herte, and late hit nat owte with wykkede wordes, but mekely resceue heme, and thynke that they bene grete matyers off mede in the blysse off heuene, and grete peyne to heme that doone so to the, wherfore thou owest to pray for heme with pure herte to almygthy gode, that they may haue grace off foryeuenes.  And yeff thow do thus, thow shalt be gladde, for the prophete seyth that 'the meke and the mylde suffryng trybulacions in rygthwysnes for goddys loue, shullene ioye'.  Therfore meke the with ale thy mygth, bothe inwarde with herte thynkyng, and owtewarde with goode dedis werkyng, so that other mowe be conuertede by thy goode example yeuyng, and thane shalt thow haue grace, off synnes forgyfnes and to encrese in vertew, and so to come to endeles blysse that mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion.
</P><P>Stirop.  The styropes of hys sadylle shalle be lownes and sadnes; lownes ayenst pryde, and sadnes ayenst worldly couetyse and flesshly lustis; so that thow be nat [to] sory for no wo, ne to glad for no wele ne welfare.  Now syt sadly in thys sadylle and kepe welle thy styroppys, that for no pryde off strengthe, off byrthe, off fayrnes, off kunnyng, or ryches, or any vertew that gode hath sent the other bodyly or gostly, thow be not cast owte off thy styroppes off lownes and sadnes.  Also [for] noo wrathe nere vnpacience for sekenes, or for losse off gode, ne losse of name, ne for no vysytacion that gode sendeth the, other sufferyng the fende to vexe the by temptacions, or by vexacion off thy euene-crystene, late nat thy horse caste the owte of thy sadylle off pacience; but sytte sadly and streyne thy ffeete in thy styroppys by the vertew [of] gostely strengthe, and doo as Cryste byddeth in the gospelle where he seyeth thus: <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">In paciencia uestra possidebitis animas uestras,</FOREIGN> that ys: Ye shullene kepe your soulys in youre pacience.  And thane lyke as the sadylle maketh the horse semely and lusty to the eye off mane, so pacience and mekenesse makis the soule louely and amyable in goddys sygth, semely and gracyous in mannys sygth, euylle and confusyously in the fendys sygth. And there-ayenst wratthe and impacience, hastynesse and hygh fulnes in herte makyne a mane vngracyous ande hatefulle in goddys sygth, sporte and gladnes to alle the deuylles in helle, and increasyn the peynes that neuer shalle haue ende. Off thys sadylle oure lorde spake to Cayne whane he was wroth with hys brothere Abelle: 'Why, seyde oure lorde, art thow wroth, and why ys thy face and thy chere so fallene?' &mdash; for he was fallene owte of the sadylle of pacience in to the foule pytt of wretthe; 'for yeff thow doo welle, thow shalt resceue off me godde mede, and yeff thou do euylle, anone thy synne cometh to the yate, to be punysshede; but the desyre off synne shalle be vnder the and thy powere, [as] the horse vnder hys master, ande thow shalt be lorde thereoff yff thou wylle, Genes. 4<HI

But sytte sadly Iob dyde, and sey as he seyde whane he had lost alle hys goode, and alle hys chyldrene were slayne and hym-self smytene with grete sekenes ful horryble; than he seyd: 'Yeff we hane take goode thyngis off goddis sonde, why shulle nat we suffre paynffulle thyngis off hys vysytacion?

REND="sup">o</HI>: 'Absteyne yow frome flesshly desyres that fyghtene ayenst the soule'.  Sythene thane that alle mannys lyff ys but fyghtyng ayenst gostly enemyes: therfore hit [ys] nedefulle to euery crystene mane nat only to gouerne welle hys horse, but also to be suerly armede for to withstande the strokys of hys enemyes.  Ryghte so hit ys nat Inowh to rewle thy body, but also thow must arme the with gostly armure to withstande the dyntis off the dartis off the deuyllis foundyng, for seynt Powle seyth Ad Eph. 6: Alle oure fyghtynge ys ayenst wyckyde spyrytes off derkenes, that ben prynces and gouernoures off synfulle mene.  'And therfore, he byddeth, arme yow in gostly armure off gode, so that ye mowe withstande the busshementis and the sleyghtis off the fende, and to stande stedefastly and parfytely in alle thyngis off ryghtwysnes.

And taketh to you the basnet off helthe, and the swerde off the holy gost, that ys goddes worde'; for, as he seyth in a nothere place, hit ys sharpere thene any two-egede swerde, Ad Hebre. 4.  Thus Seynt Powle by lykenes off bodyly armoure techyth vs gostely armure.  He byddyth yow arme yowre body by the vertew off trouthe that ys callede the Habergeoun off Ryghtwysnes; he byddeth you do ryghte to alle and yelde to gode that longeth to hyme, to youre euyncrystene that longeth to hem, bothe to youre sufferaynes and to youre felawes and to youre subgettis, and to hem that be passede owte off thys worlde with almesdede doyng and yeldyng off dettis, and to hem that bene to come in sauyng off her ryghte inherytaunce.  Thus armeth you with the habergeone of ryghtwyssnes, bothe be-fore and be-hynde and on eyther syde. And as in the habergeone euery ryng accordeth with othere and ys knytte in othere, so shulde alle trouthe accorde and be knytte to-gedere in ryghtwysnes; for yef ye fauour othere lorde or lady spiritualle or temporalle, souereyne or subgette, kyne or frende, or any creature hygh or lowe, so moche that [it] ys hynderyng to a nothers ryghte, than youre ryngis in youre habergeone accordyne nat ne be nat welle knytte to-gedere, but there ys ane hole where-thorow the fende may sle youre sowle.     And he byddeth that ye shalle arme youre leggis with gostly pouerte, so that youre hertis, and youre affeccions and youre desyres bene drawene frome erthely thyngis, and nat to sette youre loue to moche in worldely goodes ne flesshly lustis, neyther to stryue ne to plete for no worldely goode, but the more nede compelle, seeke to lyue in pease with alle mene yef ye mowene.

And taketh to yow the shelde off feythe; for as a shelde ys a tryangle and hath thre corners, in whyche tryangle yef frome the myddes be drawene thre lynes in to [the] thre corners, ther shulle be thre tryangles, whyche thre be but oone tryangle and yet noone off heme ys othere; and therfore the feyth off the holy trynyte ys lykenede to a shelde, for there be III persones ande oo gode, the ffadere the sone the holy gost, and yche of heme ys gode ande none of heme ys othere, ande yet they be alle thre but oo gode in mageste: Thys shelde of feyth of the holy trynyte ye muste take to youe in gostly fyghte, and so to sett alle youre feyghte and alle youre truste in o gode in trynyte, and prayeth to the fader almyghty that ye may haue myghte and powere, to the sone alle-wytty that ye mowe haue wytte and wysdome, ande to the holy gost that ye mowe haue grace and mercy, and so to haue myghte, wytte, and grace, to with-stonde alle gostly enemyes.

And lyke as hitt ys clene, brygth and smothe, that shote ande strokes mowe sone glyde off: so muste youre herte be clene, brygth ande smothe ffrom wyckede thowgthys, wyckede desyres and wyckede wylles.

For lyke as the hede ys hyghest and most worthy of the vtter partes off mane, so pryde ys worst off alle synnes and most vnworthy in the sygth off gode.  Take hede how hys armes were spredde abrode and drawene ffulle strayte in the tre tylle alle the synewes and veynes brestyne a-sondre, and hys hondys smytene thorowe with raggede nayles to the tre, and how grete stremes off bloode ranne owte, to dystroye the synne of wyckede werkes that mane doth with hys wykede handes.  Take hede how hys syde was openede ande hys herte clovyne a-two with a sharpe spere, and how he shadde owte both bloode and water, the whyche [shewed] that yef he had hade more bloode, more he wolde haue yeuene for mannys soule to the fader of heuene; and water, to wasshe vs frome oure synne.  Also he suffrede thys to dystroye pryde, couetyse, enuye, hate, wratthe and malyce, that renneth most in mannes herte and womans.  Take hede how hys feete were naylede to the tree streynyng oute bloode, to dystroye the synne of slouthe in goddys seruyce and in the VII dedys of mercy doyng.  Take hede how hys body was alle for-rente and alle to-tore with scharpe scourgis that frome the sole off the fote to the top off the hede there was noone hoolle place, and that was to dystroy the synne of lust and lechery that reygneth in mannes body &amp; womans.  Take hede how nakede and pore he hynge vpone the tree, to dystroye the synne of couetyse and wordely worschyppe.  Take heede how he dranke eyselle and galle, to dystroye the synne of glotonye.  And so he suffrede payne in alle partyes of hys gloryous body, to dystroye alle synne[s] in mannys [body] and womans.  Thys spere of Crystis passyone ys the best and sykerest wepyne ayenst oure enemyes.

And a wyse knygth wylle haue with hym the hylle and the sonne and the wynde.

<P>Sporys.

<P>O thow delycate creature tha[t] lyuest in wordely worschyppes and flesshly lustis in consentyng to the wykede intysyngis of thy enemyes: haue mynde how they shulle passe as the shadow, for thy body, be hit neuer so beauteuous and myghty, ande though thou kept hit neuer so welle with delycate metys and drynkes, with ryche clothes or eny other maner restorytyfys, yet hit shalle dye and turne ayene to erthe and wormes mete.  Also haue mynde off thy[s] place that ys so horryble and so paynfulle, and forsake syne whyles gode suffreth the to lyue ande hast helthe ande thy wyttes at wylle; for Salomone seyth: 'In alle thy werkes thynke one thy ende, ande thou shalt neuer doo syne'.

Thre sharpe arowes shalle be shotte off oure lorde in that day vpone hem that shullen be dampnede.  The furst arowe shalle be off clepyng to the dome, whereof Cryst seyth in the gospelle: <FOREIGN

Than the dampnable soule shalle come to the body and sey to hit: 'Aryse, thou cursyd caytyff [careyne], from thys tyme forwarde to be felaw with the horryble fendis in helle and enemy to almyghty gode.

Of thys wodnes [&amp; wretthe] spekyth the profyte Dauyd where as he prayeth to be delyueryde of bothe, seying thus: <FOREIGN

For the fadere that shalle be sauyde shalle ioye the dampnacion off hys sonne, the modere off the dowghter, the sone shalle ioye the dampnacion of hys modere, [the] doughter of the fadere.  For Cryst seyth they shulle seche for to entre in to creues of stonys and in to swolowes of the see, for fere off the syghte of the dredefulle face of Cryste; thane they [shul] prey mounteyns to falle opone theme, and hylles to hyde theyme.

Now sende thy herte in to heuyne, to wyte how it ys there.  And ther shalt thow fynde plente off alle goodys, for there ys no maner of peyne but euer-[ich] in ioye and lykyng in helthe, and so euer fyllede with alle maner off ioye and swetnesse. For there ys al maner off melody with songe of angelles brygth, and therto sekernesse of euerlastyng blysse that neuer shalle haue ende.  Also mannys body shalle be brytere thene the sonne whene hit shyneth brygthest, and shalle haue more sw[ift]nesse then alle erthely creatures mow deuyse, and her thoughtis, her wylles and her desyres shal be fulfyllyde in the twynkelyng of ane eye.  No thyng shal be there but alle goodnes and comforte; nouther no thyng shalle withstande heme, for they shalle be so myghty that they shalle mowe passe al hylles and valeys, and so to be frome the one ende off the worlde to the othere in as breeff tyme as hit may be thoughte.  For thowgh they were so febylle here, there they shullene be so lyghte, so lusty, so beauteuouse, ande so fulfyllede with ioye, that nothyng shalle withstande theyme that ys contrary to theyre wylle.  For they shulle haue ffulle knowyng of alle thyngis that euer were doone or shalle be doone, for they shulle haue fulle knowyng of the trynyte, the myghte of the fadere, the wysedome of the sone, the goodnes of the holy gost; for in the syght of the gloryous face of oure lorde gode they shullene [se] alle that may be seene off any creature; for as seynt Austyn&macr; seyth, they shulle see hyme both gode and mane, and they shalle see hem-self in hym, and alle other thyngis more and lesse&mdash;for alle thyngis that nowe be hidde, shulle thene be opyne both in syghte ande knowyng.

as though he were there in the same ioye.  And so the ioyes of that gloryous blysse may noo herte thynke nor tonge reherse; ffor though alle the ioyes that alle erthely creatures couthe deuyse myghte be comprehendyde in oo ioye, yet were hit nat in comparysone to the lest ioye that ys in that gloryous blysse.  For the ioyes that bene there be so delycate, so comfortable and so fulle off swetnesse that they myghte dey for ioye, but &thorn;at god preseruyth hem fro deth as thoo that be in [the] horryble pytte off helle &amp; stynkynge paynes myghtene dyene for payne and tormentis the whyche [they] musten suffre, but that gode preserueth theym fro dethe.  For oure lorde wolle that thoo &thorn;at hane kepte hys commaundementis and hane submyttyde hem to hys lawes, to lyue in blysse with-outene ende; and there-ayens tho that wylle nat obeye to hys lawes neyther kepe hys commaundementis, that they shalle lyue in payne with-outyne ende. &mdash; Thys ys the ryghte spore that shalle haste hem to loue oure lorde in vertewe [of] goodnes, ande to hate synne for fere of peyne(!).  For yeff a creature myghte fele the lest drope off the leste ioye whyche ys in that blysse, [he] shulde fele lytylle payne or ellys noone thowgh alle the peynes that euer were in erthe or shullene be, myghte be putte to hyme; for the grete loue [&thorn;at] suche a soule shulde haue to gode, and &thorn;e grete desyre that hit shulde haue to that endeles blysse, shulde so rauyssch the soule that hit [shuld] fele noo paynes that myghte be putte therto; neyther hit shulde haue no ioye of noone erthely goodys neyther off worldely worshyppys, but rather noying thane plesyng therto.  Thys loue steryth a mane more be a thowsandefolde thane done the peynes of helle eyther of purgatory, to lyue vertously; ffor loue perysshyth and putteth oute drede, and clenseth the soule fro synne, and maketh hit to see gode thorough gostly thoughtis, thorow gostly redyngis of holy wrytte, and thorow gostly and holy prayers, and to sty to heuynly desyres.  But I drede ther be many [&thorn;at] farene as a chylde that ys borne in a depe prysone whyche ys bothe stynkyng and horryble to see.  The moder, knowyng the wellefare that she hadde owte of prysone, ys in moche sorowe and care ande heuynesse, desyryng with alle her myghte to be oute of prysone ayene in hyr welfare:  but the chylde borne in myscheff of the prysone, ande neuer hade better knowyng of welfare, yeueth lytelle tayle to that myscheff in the prysone, for as longe as he hath hys moder with hyme and hys sustenaunce thowgh hit be but ffebylle, he maketh neyther sorowe ne care, for he longeth after no better fare, for he knoweth no better; for though hys moder telle hyme off the ioye ande off the welffare that ys oute off prisone, off the sone ande off the mone eyther off the sterres, or off the fayre floures spryngyng opone the erthe, or of the byrdys syngyng, off myrthe, of melody, or of ryche aray of lordys, of ladyes, and of welthes owte of prisone the whyche she was wonte to haue, yet alle hyr tale ys but a dreme to the chylde, for he leueth hit nat and therfor he longeth nat ther-after, and wylle nat for alle that blysse and welfare that she spekyth of forsake hys moder ne hys febylle fare that he hath with hyr; and that ys for he leueth hit nat.  Ande yet hit ys as &thorn;e modere seyth.  But were the chylde onys owte off prysone, and se the myrthe, welthe ande welfare that she spake off, he wolde be fulle sory to go ayene in to prysone there to lyfe with hys modere; ffor alle hys lyf in prisone, whyche was furst lykyng Inowgh to hym, shalle thane be to hyme fulle bytter and paynfulle, and therto he shulde neuer haue ioye ne reste in herte tylle he were ageyn in that welffare whyche he sawe oute of prisone.  Ryghte so this folk of thys worlde borne and browgth forth in sorowe and care and moche trauayle in thys wrecchede worlde that ys foule and stynkyng as a prisone; for they hane so moche loue and lykyng one theyre erthely moder ande of theyre company, that ys to say one erthely thyngis, that they hane no lykyng in heuynly thyngis ne longyn nat ther-after; for though

her gostly moder, holy chyrche, ande her gostely ffader gode hym-self, fader off alle, telle hem the blysse ande the wellfare whyche ys in the blysse off heuyne, hit ys to theyme but a dreme as the tale off the moder ys to the chylde in prysone, that they hane noo sade feyth theryne.  And tryste itt fully, though they beleue nat that hit ys so as oure moder holy chyrche tellyth, howe ther ys in this worlde but stynke ande horrybylyte and a foule dongeone in comparysone of that heuynly blysse, yet hit ys so as her gostly fader seyth, ande nat the lese for her mysbeleue.  Neuer-the-lese take hit for certeyne that they shalle neuer haue parte neyther ffelyng of that blysse, but they wol beleue ande trust fully that hit ys so as theyre modere holy chyrche telleth.  Wherfore withdrawe youre hertis from erthely thyngis and sette [not] youre loue to moche one youre erthely moder, ne truste her nat, for though she speke neuer so fayre and behote yow neuer so welle, she ys false ande wolle dysceyue yow at the last.  For she fareth as the nykare or meremaydene, that cast opone the water syde dyuerse thyngis whyche semene fayre and gloryous to mane, but anone as he taketh hit ande weneth to be sure theroff, anone she taketh hyme ande deuoureth hym.  Ryghte so thyne erthely moder casteth oute fayre ande gloryous thyngis to thy syghte, she casteth oute grete rychesse and worldely goodys ande worshyppes ande flesshly lustis, whyche bene fastnede to the rope off hope of longe lyff, and assone as thow towchest heme, that ys to say as sone as thow desyrest heme and laborest with alle thy myghte, with alle thyne herte and with alle thyne thoughtis to haue heme, anone she draweth the rope off longe lyfe, that ys, she seyth 'thow arte yonge and may lyue longe, ande therfor laboure to haue goodys ande gete the worschypp, that thow mayst lyue esyly in thyne age.  And thow lyue in lechery, in glotony, in pryde, in extorsyone or in any wrongfulle takynge, whene thou comest to age than shalt thow mowe doo grete almes, and so by prayers off pore men shalt thow haue foryeuenesse'; and so thorow hope off longe lyfe ande of other mennes prayers thowh thou lyue stylle in synne, [she] wylle take ande deuoure the in the fyre off helle.  And therfor trust her nat; but set thy trust, thyne hope, thyne loue in thy gostly moder that ys to beauteuouse and trust[i] to be-leue opone hyr, for she seyth nowthere behotyth but that shalle be performede, yeff thou wolt obey to here byddyngis.  For yeff thou haddest felt ore seyne the lest blysse that ys in heuyne, thene alle the ioyes and lykyngis that thow hast in thys worlde of erthely thyngis, shalle thane be to the grete bytternes, sorowe ande care.  Example haue we off seynt Petyr whom Cryst ladde opone the hylle off Thabor with Iohne ande Iames, and ther he schewede but a lytylle off [the] blysse of hys manhode, whyche was hys face shynyng as the sonne, hys clothys were whyte as snowe, ande Moyses ande Helyas apperede with hyme in grete blysse ande in grete mageste.  Than Petyr seyde vnto oure lorde Ihesu: Lorde, hit ys good to vs to be here, and make we thre tabernacles, on to the, another to Moyses, and another to Hely, and late us allewey dwelle here', and so anone in the syghte of that lytelle blys in comparysone off the blys that ys in heuyne, he forgatte alle the blysse off thys worlde, for he carede neythere for mete ne drynke ne for clothyng; hym thoughte he myghte haue lyuede there withoutyne ende by that blysfulle syghte, Luc. 9o.  Also seynt Powle was rauysshede in to heuene ande hade seene the vysyons and the pryuytees off gode; afterwarde alle hys lyfe in thys worlde was to hyme a peyne, so moche he longede agayne to that blysse:  wherfore he seyde:  <FOREIGN

Moyes was with gode in the mount of Synay fourty dayes and fourty nyghtes meteles ande drynkles, fedde be the presence and the speche of gode; and yet sawe he but lytelle off hys blysse.
