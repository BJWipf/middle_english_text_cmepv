<HEAD>5. THE MANOR OF BIERTON [<I>c.</I> 1360?]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Richard Fitzjohn, who died in 1297, left the manor of Aylesbury and hamlet of Bierton to his wife Emma. His heirs were his four sisters, Maud, wife of William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Isabel, wife of Robert de Vipont (whose daughters were Isabel, wife of Roger Clifford, and Idonea, wife of Roger Leyburne), Avelina, wife of Walter de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, and Joan, wife of Theobald le Botiller (<I>d.</I> 1285), great-grandfather of James le Botiller, 1st Earl of Ormonde (<I>Calend. Genealogicum</I>, ii, 540-1, 563; <I>Cal. Inq.</I>, iii, p. 283; <I>Cal. Close Rolls</I>, Ed. III, ii, 429). The genealogy of the following document is therefore hopelessly wrong. John de Stonor, the chief justice, held Bierton by knight-service of the Earl of Ormonde (<I>Feudal Aids</I>). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 6.</HEADNOTE>
<P>Domina Emmota le Mohaute, domina de Beerton, habuit quatuor filias, quarum Dux Lancastrie unam duxit, alteram dominus de March duxit, terciam dominus Warre duxit, quartam Beket, dominus de Or|mond, duxit; et sic quatripartum fuit illud dominium de Beerton. Unde dicit dictus Johannes Dalby, senior, quod omnia terra et tene|menta que fuere domini Johannis Stonor deveniebant a domino de March pro antecessore dicti domini de Stonor perquisita, et excepta una prepostura jacente inter le Beerton Grene, aliter terre nec prata, neque pasture tenementa de Beket, dominus de Ormond, per redditus et ser|vicia nec racione alicujus tenoris alterius.</P>

<P>In Christo domino salutem et sanitatem sempiternam. Domine reverende, gratias, si placet, quod toto tempore nundinarum Oxonie non inveni vel percepi aliquem interveniente Bokyngham et Oxon.; postea ivi Bokyngham et vidi pannos vestros inde dimissos satis salvos et servatos, quos vobis duxi detulisse Oxon. si pot[uissem]; et consideravi quod erant ibi plures pannos quam credidi, et multe particule de diversis generibus dijudicavi; consultum est mihi, quod non assumerem tantum pretium ad curam meam et tot diversa ante mihi ignota, nisi vos [mihi] mandaretis expressius quam fecistis. Si quidem aliquis eorum, qui pannos detulerunt illuc, veniret ad veraciter recipiendum eorum numeros et videret valorem, ne forte aliquis et aliquis posset mihi impingere et taliter imponere . . .; cui nescirem respondere sicud custodes pannorum.

<P>Domine et deo devote, noveritis, si placet, me vidisse filium vestrum Edmundum, et statum suum per duas noctes et diem considerasse: cujus infirmitas decrescit de die in diem, nec jacet in lecto; set, cum calor accesserit, quiescit modicum distemperatus non per duas horas, post quas surgit, et, sicud exigit tempus, intrat scolas, et comedit et spaciatur sanus et jocundus, ita quod nullum periculum in eo videtur. Et ipse motu proprio seipsum vobis recomendavit, et domine sue; et alios aliasque salutavit. Et incipit Donatum adiscere lente et modeste, sicud adhuc oportet. Et habet illum Donatum, quem timui fuisse per|ditum. Et vero nunquam vidi puerum talem custodiam habere, sicud ipse infirmitate durante. Magister et ejus uxor vellent aliquos de pannis suis esse domi, quia nimis multi sunt et pauciores sufficiunt, et leviter possunt, illis invitis, demoliri et deturpari. Item vobis transmitto nomina et modos librorum in uno volumine contentorum, quem librum non vult pro minori vendere possessor quam pro xij. solidis, sicud et valet judicio meo et aliorum; et si vendat, habere solucionem cito re|quirit.

<HEAD>42. JOHN DYMMOK TO [?] 1420</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This letter, which is much injured, and very difficult to decipher, is written by a bailiff at Ermington, and is apparently addressed to an officer (probably John Warefeld) of Thomas Stonor in London; Stonor himself was perhaps absent in France. Accompanying it is the "bille of expenses and alowans"; the latter is too much injured to reproduce in full, but it is not as a whole of great interest, though important as supplying Dymmok's name, and the date; it is headed:&mdash;</HEADNOTE>

<P>There are also legal expenses incurred by William Penbrygge, with his expenses on going to London; and expenses for John Hals in London. The total of receipts with expenses and allowances was &pound;41 18<I>s.</I> 3<I>d.</I>; and Dymmok had apparently &pound;21 8<I>s.</I> 0<I>d.</I> in hand.</P>
<P>The Account is probably for the year ended at Michaelmas, 1420 (8 Henry V); so this letter was presumably written late in 1420. In an Account rendered by John Warefeld, Stonor's receiver, for that year appears the receipt of &pound;15 from John Dymmok, farmer of Ermyngton, and the pay|ments include:&mdash;</P>

<P>An Account by John Dymmok for 1419-21 mentions William Mayne and John Hals (<I>id.</I>, 822/35, see vol. ii, p. 179 below). Dymmok appears on a commission in Devonshire in Feb. 1419 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Henry V, ii, 274). John Fortescue was father of Richard Fortescue of Ermington (see No. 45); he was a justice of the peace for Devon from 1418 to 1422. John Hals, 
<PB REF="00000100.tif" N="32, vol. 1"> who was on the commission of peace for Devonshire from 1420 to 1431, was a lawyer of some prominence. The paper on which the letter is written is so mutilated at the foot that it is impossible to obtain anything of its meaning; a continuation on the other side is equally hopeless (<I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, i, 32, 33).</P>

<HEAD>44. J. HURLEGH TO THOMAS STONOR 28 SEPTEMBER [1424 or earlier]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The writer, who was clearly connected with Salisbury, is probably the John Hurlegh, who was prebendary of Ramsbury in 1414, Warden of the Hospital of St. Nicholas, Salisbury, from 1418-20, and rector of Kingston Deverell; he died in 1425 (Wordsworth, <I>Cartulary of St. Nicholas Hospital</I>, p. 211; for another reference to him see <I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Henry VI, i, 234). Golafre, Warfield and Hurlegh were three of Stonor's feoffees of Ermington (see p. 36 below). Warfield was also Stonor's receiver (see No. 41). A Nicholas Cassy of Gloucester occurs in 1427-29, and a John Cassy of Gloucester in 1434 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Henry VI, i, 376, 515; ii, 372). William Alisaundre of

<HEAD>45. THE INDENTURE FOR RICHARD AND AGNES FORTESCU 29 SEPTEMBER, 1424</HEAD><HEADNOTE><P>This is a draft, on paper, of the deed which Thomas Stonor enclosed in the following letter. The original (<I>Ancient Deeds</I>, C. 3015) has some altera|tions which it was not worth showing. The last three lines are added in another hand. The deed has a certain interest as having been drafted by the famous Sir John Fortescue, then quite a young lawyer: it is perhaps too much to assume that any part of the draft is in his handwriting. Richard Fortescue was the third son of Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice; he was killed at St. Albans in 1455 (Stow, <I>Annales</I>, p. 399); the deed shows that it was he who married Agnes, daughter of Richard Holcombe, and not his son as commonly stated (<I>Works of Sir J. Fortescue</I>, ii, 151-2, ed. Lord Clermont).</P><P>This Indenture was possibly the sequel of an earlier dispute, as to which there was a Petition in Chancery by Thomas Chaucer, John Golafre, John Hurlegh, "chapeleyn," John Warefeld, and Thomas Berdelegh, showing that they were seised of the manor and hundred of Ermington, till one Richard Fortescu of great malice and forethought made a forcible entry and broke down hedges and ditches. The Petition mentions "John Fortescu, pier a dit Richard, et John Bosan, son frier en ley" (<I>Early Chancery Proceedings</I>, 69/24 P.R.O.).</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>46. THOMAS STONOR TO [SIR JOHN FORTESCUE] [30 OCTOBER, 1424]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The reference to "my uncle Belknap" shows that the writer of this letter was Thomas Stonor (<I>d.</I> 1431), whose mother was a daughter of Sir Robert Belknap. The previous document (which is clearly "your son Richard's" in|denture) gives the date 1424, and shows that the letter was addressed to Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice: the Chief Justice first appears as "gubernator" at Lincoln's Inn in 1425, so that this letter is perhaps the earliest extant reference to him in his legal career. Richard Fortescue, the judge's younger brother, is noticed on p. 36 above. Wytbury is probably the John Wydbury of Cornwall, who occurs in conjunction with John Crokker of Lyneham, near Ermington, in February, 1422 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Henry V, ii, 423); he may be the same as the John Wydbury of Southampton, squire, who died before February, 1423 (<I>ibid.</I>, Henry VI, i, 48). The letter like the foregoing deed seems to be a draft kept by Stonor for reference; this explains the absence of any endorsement. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 37.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>47. EXPENSES OF A FUNERAL [<I>before</I> 1425]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Since this funeral clearly took place at Rippinghale in Lincolnshire, the date must be earlier than 1425, in which year Thomas Stonor sold all his estates in that county (<I>Ancient Deeds</I>, C. 1223). It may therefore be safely assumed to refer to Thomas Stonor's own mother, Joan daughter of Sir Robert Bealknap. As to the possible earlier date of her death see p. xix above.

<HEAD>48. TO THOMAS STONOR [<I>c.</I> 1425]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This is a fragment of a letter, which from the mention of "master Chaucer" (Thomas Chaucer, who died in 1434) must have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor. The reference to "Dymmok" indicates that the letter had to do with Ermington. "Wonard" may possibly be William Wynnard, grandfather of Agnes Stonor (see No. 261). John Cottesmore, who was afterwards (1429-1439) a judge of the Common Pleas and chief justice in 1439, was on the commission of peace for Devonshire from 1424 to 1427; he had lands in Berks and Oxfordshire, and his grandson married a grand|daughter of Thomas Stonor (see No. 107). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 87.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>49. JOHN HAMME TO [THOMAS STONOR] [<I>c.</I> 1425]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>There is no indication of date in this letter, nor is the name of the person to whom it was written given. But the writer is probably the John Hampne who was bailiff at Horton in 1419-20 (<I>Ministers Accounts</I>, 1250/2, see vol. ii, p. 179). It must therefore have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor. With this the reference to John Martyn agrees, for there was a John Martyn on the commission of peace for Kent from 1413-36. In any case it would have been difficult to assign the letter to the time of the second Thomas Stonor; for Alice Drayton owned Horton till her death in October, 1468, and John Forth was bailiff in October, 1469 (see No. 101). The letter is now separated from the Stonor papers, to which it no doubt belongs, and is in <I>A.C.</I>, li, 63.</HEADNOTE>

<P>"Voluntas T. de S. scilicet quod"&mdash;Alice his wife to have in dower the Manor of Ermington, the Manor of Harnhull with the advowson, the Manor of Beerton juxta Ailesbury, and the Manor of la Mote in West|minster, their value being &pound;402. 13. 4. His wife is to have for life all lands and tenements acquired in Clyve, Westbere, Chestelet, Hopelond, Stureye, and Horton in Kent, and the Manor of Penyton Meysy with the advowson, for the sustinence and finding in food, clothes and education (<I>in victu, vestitu et doctrina</I>) of his daughters. Thomas Chaucer, whilst alive, is to have the governance and supervi|sion of his son and heir Thomas, with the issues and profits of the Manor of Hembury for his sustinence till the age of twenty-one. The marriage of his said son is to be sold by Chaucer, his wife Alice, his brother John Hampden, and John Warfeld. The proceeds are to be applied for the marriages of his daughters, Elizabeth, Maud, Philippa, Joan, and Anne, together with the issues and profits of the Manors of Dodecote, Sottewell, and Bensheves, Berks, and Stonor, Watlyngton and Cleyore in Oxfordshire. His daughters are during their minority to be in the governance of his widow, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld. Each daughter is to have 200 marks at least for her marriage. They are to be married in order of age. If one or more should die unmarried (<I>quod absit</I>), her portion is to be divided equally amongst the survivors. If through the death of his said sons<NOTE PLACE="foot">"Predicti filii mei;" but only Thomas has so far been named.</NOTE> under age without legitimate issue, his daughters inherit his lands, the payments of the said 200 marks are to lapse. His wife, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld are then to dispose of the profits of the marriages of his male heirs and of the said Manors during the minority of his heirs in discharge of his conscience, according to the will and ordinance of his parents and ancestors as in their last wills more fully appears. In the event of his wife's death his son John is to have the reversion of the Manor of Burewardescote on condition that he release to his brother Thomas his right in gavelkind to all lands in Kent, as well those which Thomas Stonor held in right of his wife as those newly acquired.</P>

<HEAD>59. THE BATTLE OF ST. ALBANS 21-22 MAY, 1455</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Amongst the <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, iii, 4-11, there is an English narrative of the Battle of St. Albans, which seems to have been written and circulated in the interest of the Yorkist party. It was communicated to <I>Arch&aelig;ologia</I> (vol. xx, pp. 519-22) in 1822 by John Bayley, keeper of the Records in the Tower, who attributed it to Sir William Stonor, misled as it would seem by the fact that Sir William Stonor was 24 years afterwards steward of St. Albans Abbey at Wallingford (see No. 244). The presence of the document amongst the Stonor MSS. seems to be accidental. Dr. Gairdner reprinted the text from <I>Arch&aelig;ologia</I> in the <I>Paston Letters</I>, No. 283. There is thus no need to re|print it here, though it seems right to record the source whence it was derived. Apart from some slight variations in spelling the printed text is accurate, ex|cept at two points. The name of the place in St. Peter's Street, where the King's banner was pitched, should be "Goslawe" not "Boslawe". In the list of Lords who were hurt there should be inserted between Buckingham and Stafford: "the lord of Dudle with an arowe in the vysage". The original is on a large sheet of paper folded to make 16 pages; the narrative is written on the first 6&frac12; pages.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>60. JOHN ELMES TO THOMAS STONOR 6th FEB. [? 1457]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The 6th of February fell on a Sunday in 1452, 1457, 1463, and 1474. If the writer may be identified with John Elmys, the merchant of Henley, who occurs in 1443 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Henry VI, iv, 169), the most likely date is 1457. "My lady your sister" is clearly Isabel, wife of Thomas Sackville of Falley or Fawley, which is halfway between Stonor and Henley. Thomas Sackville died in 1466, and if this letter is read as implying that Isabel Sack|ville was a widow, the date must be 1474. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 43.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>63. JOHN FRENDE TO THOMAS STONOR [? APRIL, 1462]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This seems to be the earliest letter relating to the dispute between Thomas Stonor and Richard Fortescue. We know that Stonor was at Ermington on 10 May, 1462. In this letter Frende seems to desire his master's presence, and it is possible that the date was soon after Easter (18 April) in that year. It seems to be earlier than Nos. 64 and 71. The Richard Fortescue of this letter was the eldest son of the Richard Fortescue of No. 45, and was there|fore a nephew of the Chief-Justice. Stonor's mother, who was married to Richard Drayton, had rights of dower at Ermington&mdash;see p. 48 above. For the further history of the dispute see Nos. 64, 71, 72, 79-82 and 91.

<HEAD>65. THOMAS HAMPTON TO THOMAS STONOR [1462]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The history of Mistress Swete's case is too complicated for treatment here and has therefore been given at length in an Appendix to the Introduction&mdash;see pp. xlviii-lvi above. This and No. 67 were clearly written whilst the litiga|tion was pending,.and since No. 67 is dated 31st August both letters must be ascribed to 1462; after July, 1463, Mistress Swete's friends could no longer have believed that Thomas Romesey was son of Sir Walter and his first wife Joan. The writer was Hampton of Kimble&mdash;see Nos. 68 and 76. It is diffi|cult to tell why he calls Mistress Swete his sister, unless Hampton's wife was a sister of Thomas Swete. Stapulham (now Staplefarm) was a vill or tithing in the Hundred of South Damerham, Wilts. I have not discovered what place is meant by Sylverton. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 54.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>68. H. UNTON TO THOMAS STONOR [? 1462]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The mention of Wykes and Hampton or Hampden of Kimble suggests that this letter may have to do with Mistress Swete's affairs&mdash;see Note on No. 65. If so it may be assigned to 1462 or 1463. Unton was a lawyer, see No. 313. "Maister Mylle" is presumably Stonor's brother-in-law Thomas Mull&mdash;see No. 69&mdash;who was also a lawyer. "Maister Fouler" is perhaps Richard Fowler&mdash;see No. 150. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 81.</HEADNOTE>

The writer of the postscript is clearly his wife Margery, daughter of Sir Stephen Popham; when appointing her to be an executor of his will (<I>P.C.C.</I>, 27 Logge), Hampden described her as "my wife whom of youth I have know wele con|scienshid, and to me a trew and lovyng wife".

<HEAD>80. JOHN FRENDE v. RICHARD FORTESCUE [1466]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Though these documents do not form part of the <I>Stonor Papers</I> they are important for the history of the dispute at Ermington.

The appearance of Stonor and Thomas Mulle (who no doubt represented Richard Drayton) shows that "plegii de prosequendo" were in some cases at all events genuine persons, although it has been argued that the pledges were usually fictitious persons (like John Doe and Richard Roe); the Richard Gryme and William Lyme of p. 79 below may be such a fictitious instance.

<HEAD>87. HUMPHREY FORSTER TO THOMAS STONOR 21 OCTOBER [1466]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This seems to have reference to the death of Thomas Sackvile of Falley or Fawley in 1466&mdash;see Nos. 88 and 89. Sackvile's wife Isabel was a sister of Thomas Stonor and of Forster's wife. Rokes was Sackvile's nephew and heir (see note on No. 89). In <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, ix, 38-39, there is the rough draft of a contract of marriage between Thomas, eldest son and heir-apparent of Thomas Rokes, and a daughter (unnamed) of Stonor. If the said daughter died "before flesshly knowleche had" another daughter, if unmarried and of convenient age, was to take her place. Rokes bargained to make a grant of the reversion of the lands which Isabel, late wife of Thomas Sakevyle, held for life, to the value of 20 marks a year, and of other lands to the value of 10 marks. If Rokes' son at the age of fourteen and Stonor's daughter at the age of thirteen disagree the contract was to be void. The marriage does not seem to have ever taken effect though it was still being discussed in 1477&mdash;see No. 179. The marriage contract was probably drafted about the date of this letter. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 47.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>89. THOMAS ROKES TO THOMAS STONOR [1 OCTOBER, 1467]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Sir Thomas Sakeville of Falley or Fawley, Bucks, had a son Thomas, and a daughter Maud who married N. Kentwood. The second Thomas Sakeville had a son Thomas and a daughter Margery. The third Thomas is probably the husband of Isabel, sister of Thomas Stonor (<I>d.</I> 1474). Margery married Thomas Rokes, no doubt the Thomas Rokes the elder of Ascot and Wing who died in 1457, and mentions in his will Margery his wife, and his sons John Rokes and Robert Rufford.<NOTE PLACE="foot">For a lawsuit by his executors see <I>Placita de Banco</I>, 818, m. 41.</NOTE> He was presumably the father of Thomas Rokes the writer of this letter, who calls Isabel Sackville his aunt, for in an inquisition held in 1487 it was found that Thomas Rokes son of Margery Sakeville inherited property granted to N. Kentwood as heir of Sir Thomas Sakeville. Thomas Rokes the younger calls Thomas Stonor his brother, and must therefore have been married to his sister or half-sister; from No. 182 it appears that his wife's name was Alice, and since Alice daughter of the elder Thomas Stonor was married to Humphrey Forster, it is probable that Alice Rokes was a daughter of Alice and Richard Drayton (Wrottesley, <I>Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls</I>, pp. 438, 441, 458; <I>Cal.

A pedigree in <I>Harley MS.</I>, 1139, f. 45, makes the second Thomas Rokes of Falley marry a daughter of Fowler of Ricote, and his son, a third Thomas, marry a daughter of Sir William Stonor; the last statement is certainly incorrect.

In Trinity Term, 1468, a writ of <I>exigi facias</I> was issued to the Sheriff against them. (<I>Coram Rege Rolls</I>, 826, m. 41, and 829, m. 105; see also p. 83 above.) Thus the date of this letter is 18 Oct., 1468, a fortnight after Drayton's death. Lyneham is in Yealmpton, not far from Ermington.

<HEAD>94. RICHARD QUATERMAYNS TO THOMAS STONOR AND HUMPHREY FORSTER [? 1467 or 1468]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>In the absence of any clue to the commission referred to, and of any certainty as to the feast intended by St. Thomas Day, it is difficult to fix the 
<PB REF="00000168.tif" N="100, vol. 1"> date of this letter. But Richard Croft, Stonor and Forster were not on the commission of peace for Oxfordshire or the town of Oxford in the reign of Henry VI. Quatermayns, William Marmyon and Croft appear on a special commission in the county in 1463 (<I>C. P. R.</I>, Edw. IV, i, 278), but I have not found any commission relating to the town. Since Stonor was not sheriff, 1465-66 is impossible. If St. Thomas Day means 7 July (Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr) the year is probably 1467, when 7 July was a Tuesday; if it means 21 Dec. (St. Thomas the Apostle) the year is probably 1468, when 21 Dec. was on a Wednesday. There were sessions of Parliament in June, 1467, and in May, 1468. The subsidy voted on the latter occasion was being collected in Nov.-Dec. following (<I>Rot. Parl.</I>, vi, 233). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 66.</HEADNOTE>

There are, however, no Returns of Members of Parliament for 1455, 1461, 1463 and 1470, and Stonor may have sat in one of these Parliaments.

<HEAD>110. SIR RICHARD HARCOURT TO THOMAS STONOR 1 FEB. [? 1470]</HEAD><HEADNOTE><P>The chief subject of this letter was clearly the marriage of Thomas Stonor's ward, John Cottesmore, to one of his daughters&mdash;probably Joan&mdash;see Nos. 128 and 136. I cannot explain why Harcourt addresses Stonor as "my ffadyr". The letter would naturally imply that Harcourt was married to a daughter of Thomas Stonor, and that a son or daughter of his by a former wife was going to marry a daughter or son of Thomas Stonor. But Richard Harcourt is said to have married (1) Edith, daughter of Thomas Sencler or St. Clere, by whom he had a son Christopher and a daughter Anne; (2) Eleanor, daughter of Sir Roger Lewknor, by whom he had a son John, who married Margaret, daughter of William Bray; and (3) Katherine, 
<PB REF="00000181.tif" N="113, vol. 1"> daughter of Sir Thomas de la Pole, and widow of Sir Miles Stapleton, by whom he had a son William. Christopher Harcourt married Joan, younger daughter of Sir Miles and Katherine Stapleton. Anne Harcourt married Henry Fiennes, Lord Say. In his will Harcourt mentions two other daughters, Isabell, and Alice, wife of William Besillys. He mentions his two wives, Edith and Katherine, but there is no reference to Eleanor nor to her alleged son John. (See Collins' <I>Peerage</I>, iv, 436-7, ed. Brydges; <I>Harcourt Papers</I>, i, 73-6; Blomefield, <I>History of Norfolk</I>, ix, 320-21; <I>P.C.C.</I>, 27 Logge.) It would be a simple solution to the difficulty if we could suppose that the Richard Harcourt of this letter was a different person to the well-known knight. But the writer of No. 145 was certainly Sir Richard Harcourt, and the signatures of both letters are in the same hand, and have paraphs of identical design. Moreover, Sir Richard Harcourt and Thomas Stonor were co-feoffees for Katherine Arundel (see No. 125). The pretended relationship must therefore remain a mystery. In his letter to William Stonor (No. 145) Harcourt signs himself as "your loving cosyn," but in this letter refers to "my brother William Stonor". If there had been a child-marriage between children of Harcourt and Stonor it would explain "my daughter and yours"; but even of this there is no evidence, though if one of the parties had died young that would be not unnatural.</P><P>As to the date of the letter the reference to Harcourt's business about the King's matters would suggest 1467, when he was sheriff of Oxon and Berks. But since Sir Miles Stapleton only died in October, 1466, Harcourt is not very likely to have married his widow before 1 Feb., 1467. Moreover, the marriage of Cottesmore to Thomas Stonor's daughter was some time later than October, 1468&mdash;see No. 137. This letter is therefore probably not later than 1 Feb., 1470. Dame Katherine Harcourt was niece by marriage to Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which makes the reference to "our own good lady" natural. This letter may just possibly be holograph; but probably is signed only, like No. 145. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 57.</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>113. WADEHILL TO THOMAS STONOR 17 JANUARY [1471?]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This letter from a servant of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was clearly written after the birth of the Duke's eldest son, John, who was probably born in 1464, and before the death of his mother, the Duchess Alice, in May, 1475. The only intervening years in which 17th January fell on a Thursday were 1465 and 1471. The former seems precluded by the mention of "the young ladies," since Suffolk's daughters were probably younger children; though the fact that an adjourned Parliament met in 1465 on 21st January would make this date otherwise suitable. The date 1471 is difficult, since it involves a reference to an otherwise unknown meeting of the Parliament of the Lancastrian Restoration. The Chancellor in both years was George Neville, Archbishop of York, with whom the Stonors had friendly relations. Suffolk, who was married to a sister of Edward IV., would naturally desire to keep away from Court in 1471. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 85.</HEADNOTE>

After Stonor's death, and the death of Sir John Arundell, Katherine filed a petition in Chancery showing that Harcourt had refused to make an estate to her; "William Menwynnek de Lostwythyell, gentilman," was then one of her sureties (<I>Early Chancery Proceedings</I>, 66/140, P.R.O.). "Wynyanton" or Winnington is in the parish of Gunwalloe, and Kennall in the parish of Stithians; for deeds relating thereto, see <I>Ancient Deeds,</I> A. 10303, A. 10409. In 1481 Sir James Tyrell and Anne his wife brought an action against Sir Richard Harcourt for the manors of Nansladron, Carmynowe, Kenell and Wynyanton; Harcourt in his reply stated that Kenell and Wynyanton were held by Richard Tomyowe; Edward Grymston was then dead (<I>Placita de Banco</I>, Roll 876, m. 458).

<HEAD>127. WILLIAM STONOR TO THOMAS STONOR [? 20 APRIL, 1473]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>The most probable year is 1473. In 1471 St. George's Day was on a Thursday, so that year is out of the question. In April-May, 1472, William Stonor seems to have been at Horton and in London (see Nos. 121 and 122); in this letter he proposes to come home by Henbury. The letter has to do with the dispute about the water of Erme, of which we hear first in the pre|vious letter, and get the conclusion in No. 184. Selenger is probably Thomas St. Leger, who was on the commission of peace for Devonshire. As to Lady Arundell, see No. 125. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 74.</HEADNOTE>

<PB REF="00000202.tif" N="134, vol. 1"> The first is a copy of the Latin Letters of Presentation addressed on 20 July, 1473, by William Olyver and John Hille, bailiffs of the town of Bridport, to Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, on behalf of John Wikes, chaplain, for his admission to the Chantry of St. Katherine in the parish church of Bridport, in their presentation and now vacant through the resignation of John Lugge. The second is a letter written apparently by a bailiff to his master, of which there are two drafts written on the back of the paper; the date of this is 8 Dec., 1473. The third document consists of Memoranda written on the same side as the Letters of Presentation; they are probably of about the same date as the other two. These latter documents seem to have sufficient interest of their own to justify their inclusion.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>130. THOMAS GATE TO THOMAS STONOR [<I>before</I> 1474]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Thomas Gate of Brutewell (i.e. Britwell, between Farnham and Hitcham), Bucks, <I>alias</I> of Wycombe, was escheator of the counties of Beds and Bucks before 1467 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Edw. IV, ii, 390; cf. <I>Lists and Indexes</I>, xi, 268, P.R.O.). A pedigree of Ramsey, ap. <I>Harley MS.</I>, 1533, f. 57, gives the descent of Thomas Ramsey from Richard Nernute. According to this pedigree Nernute had a son Myles, whose daughter Isabel married Reginald Beauchamp; the Beauchamp line of descent was Myles, Myles, John, Richard, Myles of Hicham, and Robert; Robert's daughter Isabel married Thomas Ramsey, father of the Thomas Ramsey who married Isabel Hampden, half-sister of 
<PB REF="00000204.tif" N="136, vol. 1"> the first Thomas Stonor. The early part of this pedigree seems to be un|trustworthy. Miles de Beauchamp held Hucham or Hitcham at his death in 1336 (<I>Cal. Inq.</I>, viii, 149). He was probably the husband of the daughter of Richard Nernute (or Noirnute). His heir was his grandson Miles (son of his son Richard), who held Hucham in 1346 (<I>Feudal Aids</I>, i, 116). This Miles was probably the father of Robert de Beauchamp, who was great-grandfather of the Thomas Ramsey of 1474 and brother of Elizabeth, the ancestress of Thomas Gate. In 1382 Isabella (or Elizabeth) de Beauchamp held Hucham as heiress of Miles de Neirnut (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Richard II, ii, 193). Thomas Worley occurs as a servant of Edward IV in 1465 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Edw. IV, i, 437). The date of this letter must be earlier than 1474 and later than 1460. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 52.</HEADNOTE>

William Stonor's own age makes an earlier date than 1470 unlikely, and since in 1472, 2nd Feb. was on a Monday and in 1473 on a Tuesday, these years are less likely.

<HEAD>137. WILL OF THOMAS STONOR 1474</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This is an imperfect draft or copy of the Will. The date must be later than 8 October, 1468, since Richard Drayton is dead. Apparently all Stonor's daughetrs were unmarried, so the date must be before the marriage of one of them to John Cottesmore (see Nos. 110 and 128). The date of that marriage was therefore probably not before 1470. The will may be compared with the Arbitrament between William Stonor and his mother, No. 157. See further vol. ii., p. 184.

<HEAD>139. EXPENSES OF AN INQUISITION POST MORTEM [? 1474]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This most probably relates to the Inquisition for the second Thomas Stonor in 1474. The names of Twenyo (Twynho) and Sir John Butteler point to the reign of Edward IV. See Nos. 215 and 294 (note). Nos. 229-232 in <I>Ancient Correspondence</I>, xlvi, contain the oaths of the Jurors in the In|quisitions held on that occasion in Kent and Hampshire together with the names of the Jurors. The Inquisitions were held in October, 1474; it was found that Thomas Stonor held no land in either county, that he died on 23rd April last, and that William, his son and heir, was aged 24 and more. The nine documents numbered <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 225 to 233, were found stitched together; for the others see Nos. 138, 143, 144, 152. From <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, iv, 10.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>150. BOND BY WILLIAM STONOR TO RICHARD FOWLER 9 MAY, 1475</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Richard Fowler, besides being Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was a prominent man in Oxfordshire. He was a nephew of Richard Quatermayns (see Nos. 93 and 116). Leland states that Quatermayns had "a servant caullid <I>Thomas</I> Fowler, his clerk, a toward felowe that after was Chauncelor of the duchy of Lancastre," and was godfather to his son and "namid hym Richard Quatermains Fowler"; the second Richard Fowler was Quatermayns' heir, but proved "a very onthrift and sold al his landes" (<I>Itinerary</I>, i, 115). The elder Richard Fowler was an arbitrator between William Stonor and his mother (see No. 156); he may be the "Master Fowler" of Nos. 71 and 174, and "Cousin Fowler" of Nos. 170 and 172. Quatermayns calls Thomas Stonor his cousin in No. 92. Fowler died in Nov., 1477 (Will, P.C.C., 32 Wattys). For this Bond, which has been cancelled by cutting, see Nos. 144 and 145. From <I>Ch.

No. 153 shows that the writer had lately been in trouble, and this letter may perhaps be a little earlier in date.

The date of this letter cannot be fixed, but either 1474 or 1475 are suitable years. On 25 October, 1476, William Stonor was at Stonor (see No. 173); so that year is unlikely.

<HEAD>157. AN ARBITRATION BETWEEN WILLIAM STONOR AND HIS MOTHER 28 NOV., 1475</HEAD><HEADNOTE>After the death of Thomas Stonor, his executors, Jane Stonor, Thomas Hampden and Thomas Ramsey, by deed indented granted to William Stonor "all thing which to tham shuld apperteigne as executours," and William Stonor took upon him the charge of performing the will "demandyng as well the rentes of diverse landes and tenementes, as diverse goodes, catalles and dueties, which perteigned to his said ffader". Controversies and variances having grown between Jane Stonor and her son, the matters in dispute were submitted to Richard Fowler, Humphrey Forster, and William Danvers, who gave their award on 28 NOV., 1475. The document is much mutilated, and a great part of the statement of claim by William Stonor is missing. After reciting the circumstances under which the dispute had arisen, and stating the claims made by the two parties, the arbitrators gave their award in the terms printed below. This contains all that is of real interest save for those points added in footnotes. From <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, vi.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>166. THOMAS BETSON TO KATHERINE RYCHE 1 JUNE, 1476</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Katherine Ryche, whom Betson married in 1478, was clearly at the time of this letter little more than a child. Katherine was the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Stonor by her first husband, Thomas Ryche or Riche. She was god-daughter of her mother's grandfather, William Gregory, who left her 20s. in his will dated 6 November, 1465 (<I>Collections of a London Citizen</I>, p. xlvi); Gregory does not mention any other of his great-grand-children; it may be conjectured that Katherine was born in 1463 or 1462. "Holake, your gentyll squyer," is probably Thomas Howlake (see Nos. 164 and 223). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 255.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>168. ELIZABETH STONOR TO WILLIAM STONOR 18 AUGUST, 1476</HEAD><HEADNOTE>"My brodyr Stocker" is Sir William Stocker, husband of Elizabeth Stonor's sister Margaret. "My brodyr Crooke" is probably her own brother John. If "my husbond's terement" refers to the anniversary of Thomas Ryche's death, he must have died nearly a year before his will was proved. Elizabeth Stonor seems to have spent all the latter part of 1476 in London. Unlike most of Elizabeth Stonor's letters this is holograph.

The trouble that led to the riot seems to be referred to in No. 179. Thomas Rokes, the elder, was probably the writer of No. 89, from which it would appear that he was married to a sister or half-sister of Thomas Stonor.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>190. HENRY MAKNEY TO WILLIAM STONOR [<I>before</I> 1478]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Henry Makney of Makney or Mackney, near Wallingford, in Berkshire, had a lawsuit between 1467 and 1472 with John Colyngrygge. Colyngrygge and his wife Isabell, together with John FitzRobert, and his wife Agnes, pleaded that William Makney, great-grandfather (<I>besayll</I>) of Isabell and Agnes, was seised of the manor of Makney and levied a fine in 1350 entailing it on him and his wife Elyn and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to his right heirs; and that Henry Makney, son of Richard, son of William, son of the said William and Elyn, and whole brother of Isabell and Agnes, saying that he had been married 15 years and had no issue, had covenanted with Thomas Stonor, esquire, for 20<I>l.</I>, part of a great sum to be paid, that the 
<PB REF="00000265.tif" N="31, vol. 2"> manor should be made sure to Stonor and his heirs. To this Henry Makney replied that his father Richard was seised in his demesne as of fee, and so enfeoffed Sir Robert Shotebroke and others, who granted the manor to Richard and Margaret his wife. After Richard's death Margaret made an estate in a moiety of the manor to Henry for her life; she was still alive and seised of the manor, Henry not holding by the fine. He denied the alleged bargain. Colyngrygge replied asking for Makney to be bound not to defeat the fine (<I>Early Chancery Proceedings</I>, 40/87-89). The litigation may have been pro|longed, but seems from these letters to have been decided in Makney's favour. This letter is earlier than 1478; it is convenient to place it here in conjunc|tion with the next two documents. From No. 192, William Stonor would seem to have acquired some right in the manor; in the Arbitrament between him and his mother he was awarded Makney's obligacion of &pound;40, whereof &pound;20 was yet due (see vol. i, p. 164 above). Leland describes Mackney as "a pratie manor place of brike," builded by one Courte, "uncle to Molines that now dwellith there" (<I>Itinerary</I>, i, 120). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 103.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>220. RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 7 JULY [? 1478]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This letter clearly belongs to the same time as Nos. 219 and 221. Since Stonor is a knight the date cannot be earlier than 1478. Otherwise the only clue to the date is the statement in this letter that the King was to be at Windsor on 8 July, and was going thence to Nottingham. Edward IV was at Nottingham in 1478, 1481, and 1482. In 1482 he went north at the end of May&mdash;see No. 313&mdash;and during July was in Kent&mdash;3rd, Manor of Knoll, 7th and 8th, Canterbury, 9th to 18th, Dover (<I>Chancery Warrants</I>, Series I, File 882). In 1481 he seems to have been at Southwell on 28th June to 5th July, and at Scrooby on 13th to 19th July (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, iii, 279-80). The <I>Chancery Warrants</I> (for Privy Seals) do not give clear evidence for move|ments in July, 1481, which year the evidence of the Patent Rolls makes un|likely. If the year is 1481 there is the further difficulty that Stonor must have married his third wife within two months of the death of his second. In 1478 Edward IV was at Greenwich from 2nd to 6th July, was perhaps in 
<PB REF="00000293.tif" N="59, vol. 2"> London on the 7th and 8th, was at Ditton on 12th and 13th, Windsor on 15th to 18th, Berkhamstead on 20th, Higham Ferrers on 26th, and Notting|ham on 7th August (<I>Chancery Warrants</I>, Series I, File 866). In No. 247 and all subsequent letters Page addresses Stonor as "knight for the King's body"; he does not do so in this letter nor in No. 221, an omission which suggests that they were earlier than 1479. So on the whole 1478 seems to be the most likely date, but the point is of no great importance. The Chamber|lain is William Hastings. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 186.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>223. THOMAS HOWLAKE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 24 JULY 1478</HEAD><HEADNOTE><P>It does not seem possible to explain the whole of Howlake's transactions; no doubt there were some things which would have been obvious to his em|ployer but are obscure to us. A comparison with Nos. 2 and 41 in the <I>Cely Papers</I> gives a partial clue. The first figures (xl., xxxij., xxxvij., and j) are the numbers of the serplars (see No. 159 above). Each serplar contained 2&frac12; sacks (ss. di.) with a number of odd cloves. A clove contained 7 lb., and there were 52 cloves to the sack. So the total weight would be 10 sacks + 149 cloves, or 12 sacks 45 cloves; the total weight clear is given, however, as only 11&frac12; sacks 14 cloves. From the Cely Account it appears that in selling a rebate was allowed. In the Cely Account (No. 41) the rebate was 2 cloves on the sack, and fractions of less than half a sack were disregarded; but 
<PB REF="00000296.tif" N="62, vol. 2"> (perhaps as compensation) the rebate on the last serplar was 4 cloves, though it only contained 1 sack 18 cloves. In Howlake's account the total rebate was apparently 57 cloves; if we calculate it at 4&frac12; cloves the sack and dis|regard resulting fractions of cloves, the rebate on the first serplar was 15 cloves, and on each of the others 14, giving the total of 57. This explains the "poyse". The price of 11&frac12; sacks 14 cloves at 19 marks the sack should be &pound;149 1s. 6d., not &pound;147 12s. 8d.; possibly there was a reduction in respect of a broken sack; or it may be that this is the "more respyte" to which Howlake refers. The value in sterling money agrees with the value in Flemish (&pound;180 8s. 9g.), if one-third is taken at 25s. 4g. Flemish for &pound;1 sterling, and the rest at 24s. It is therefore clear that Howlake when he wrote "viij s. g. ffl." meant only 8 shillings Flemish. The "g" presumably means "groot"; but it is clear that if so there were, as calculated, 12 groots to the shilling; for on this basis the three bills exactly make up &pound;180 8s. 9d. Flemish.</P><P>Peter van de Rade and Danyell van de Rade, merchants of Bruges, appear in the <I>Cely Papers</I> (Nos. 2 and 10). Dr. John Coke was employed in July, 1478, to treat with Thomas de Plana, the representative of Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy "super Intercursu ac communicatione Mercansie necnon Piscatione super mare," and to arrive at a settlement of all commercial grievances between England and Flanders. As a result a treaty was con|cluded on 12 July; to the treaty there were annexed documents dealing with the complaints of the Merchants of the Staple, fixing Ordinances for the Staple at Calais and providing for the inspection of the wool-trade there (<I>Foedera</I>, xii, 66-86). "Thursday last" was 23 July, the day before Howlake wrote his letter, so that news of what had been done at Bruges could hardly have reached Calais. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 175.</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>237. DAME ELIZABETH STONOR TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 26 MARCH [1479]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Since Sir William Stonor is a knight, the date cannot be earlier than 1478. From No. 205 it appears that Lady Stonor went to London on 25th March, 1478, so that 1479 is the only possible year. "Lovel's daughters" may be the children of William Lovel, Lord Morley, who died in 1476; his son Henry, died in 1489 and was succeeded by his sister Alice; in No. 282 there is reference to an Agnes Lovell, apparently a ward of Stonor. Thomas Stedolfe was a Justice in Eyre in the service of Elizabeth Woodville in 1477 (<I>Cal. Pat. Rolls</I>, Edw. IV, iii, 52). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 210.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>255. H. CARNEBULL TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 16 NOV. [1479]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This clearly relates to the stewardship of Thame. In <I>Ancient Deeds</I>, C. 5623, there is a copy of a grant by the dean and canons of Lincoln, at the request of Thomas, bishop of Lincoln, to Sir William Stonor and the heirs of his body, of the office of Steward of the lordships of Thame and Dorchester, in Oxfordshire, and of Wooburn and Tynghurst, Bucks., at a fee of &pound;6 1s. 8d. On the same paper is a copy of another deed dated 6 Dec., 1479. The grant of the stewardship may fairly be assigned to the same time. This letter suits well with 1479, for in that year 16th Nov. was on a Tuesday; Carnebull was going to Leicester on the following Monday, would stay there till the 26th, and then would be at Newark till 4 Dec., and at Lincoln till 12 Dec. Quatermayns and Fowler, who seem to have held the stewardship of Thame, both died in 1477. As Stonor was a knight this letter could not in any case be earlier than 1478, so that there must have been an interval between Fowler's death and Stonor's appointment. William Lenthall lived at Lachford, near Rycote&mdash;see No. 297. Henry Davers was one of Fowler's executors (<I>P.C.C.</I>, 32 Wattys). From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 144.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>263. [WALTER ELMES TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR] [1480]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>This letter, which is unsigned and apparently intentionally obscure, seems to be in the writing of Walter Elmes, who we know from Nos. 282, 287, and 288 periodically visited Stonor's Devonshire estates. On this occasion his business would seem to have been to make arrangements for the care of Agnes Wydeslade's estates; the date is therefore probably some time in 1480; since there is no reference to the trouble at Wolveston (see Nos. 266-68) it was per|haps written in March or April. On the repairs at Clist, see No. 285. The Wydeslade mentioned in this letter is probably the father of Lady Stonor's first husband. As to Germyn see No. 268.

<HEAD>294. MARY BARANTYNE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [13 NOV. 1481]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>John Barantyne of Little Haseley, Chalgrove and Churchill, son of Drue Barantyne by Jane, daughter of Sir John Wroughton, married Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Sir Stephen Popham. He died on 30 June, 1474 (<I>Chancery Inq. p.m.</I>, Edward IV., file 50, no. 36). On 5 Aug., 1475, Richard Frebodie and others were accused of having abducted Elizabeth, widow of John Barantyne, by force from the House of the Friars Preachers in London (<I>Early Chancery Proceedings</I>, 52/3). In his will (dated 28 June, 1474, proved 8 April, 1477) John Barantyne directed that his sons, John the elder, Austyn, and John the younger, and his daughter Anne, should "be ruled and guyded by Elizabeth, my wife," who was to hold all his lands for life, except lands in Chalgrove purchased of Sir Richard Harcourt, and lands in Goldore called Symyuns lands, purchased of Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which John his son and heir was to have (<I>P.C.C.</I>, Wattys, 34). All the children were under age; John the elder was returned as fourteen years of age and more in October, 1474. A document in <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, iv, 20 gives particulars "for the astate to Marie Barantyne" which are thus summarised: "Of Seyntcleres lond in Chalgrove, lx. s. Symeons in Goldore, lxvj. s. viij. d. And of Atyndon in the paroch. of Thame, lxxiij. s. viij. d. Summa, x. li. For my mastres Marie Barantynes joyntour." From No. 172 it would appear that the marriage took place before 22 Oct., 1476, when John Barantyne's widow seems to have been married to Sir John Boteler; in No. 310 it is implied that it took place before the death of John Barantyne the elder. Mary Barantyne's son William was born on 31 Dec., 1481; John Parson remembered that at his christening there was a fire in the belfry, by which the midwife stripped the child, and that Sir William Stonor, who was godfather, said the child loved it (<I>Cal. Inquisitions</I>, Henry VII., ii, 6). This points to 1481 as the probable 
<PB REF="00000365.tif" N="129, vol. 2"> year for this letter; in 1481 the feast of St. Hugh (17 Nov.) was on a Saturday. It is probable that John and Mary Barantyne were both at this time still under age and so under the control of Elizabeth Barantyne (or Boteler)&mdash;see Nos. 310 and 311. In May, 1482, there was a suit brought in the Common Pleas by Thomas Danvers against John Barantyne as to the manor of Wynnale and lands in Wynnale and Henton, which was settled by the sale to Danvers on 8 May, 1482, of the manor together with lands in Wynnale, Shynnor and Henton (<I>Placita de Banco</I>, Roll 880, m. 481, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2). Mary Barantyne's letter probably has reference to this transaction. John Barantyne and his mother were involved in much litigation at this time; as to "Seynclere's lands" in a friendly suit with Sir Richard Harcourt; and with John Nowers as to the manor of Churchill (<I>id.</I>, Roll 881, mm. 296, 451, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2; see also Roll 876, mm. 443, 444 as to lands in Aston Torold and Northmorton, and the manor of Attyndon).</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>300. JOHN SHYNNER TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [? 1481]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>John Shynner was a Modbury man (see list in No. 71) who, as these letters show, received the living of Penton Mewsey from Sir William Stonor. Some light is thrown on this letter by <I>Early Chancery Proceedings</I>, 40/227, where Robert Shynner, the younger, shows that his father, Robert Shynner, the elder, was seised in his demesne as of fee of 3 messuages and 2 acres of land in "Mychell Modbury," and enfeoffed John Rous, John Legh, Walter Torryng, and William Stenlake to the entent that after his death they should make an estate to the petitioner; Legh, Torryng, and Stenlake had done so, but Rous refused, and Shynner therefore prayed for a writ of <I>sub p&oelig;na.</I> These proceedings took place between 1467 and 1472. John Shyn|ner was apparently another son of Robert Shynner, the elder. Cristina, widow of Robert Shynner, and John Shynner, as executors of Robert Shyn|ner, sued Richard Fortescue of Valepitte in Michaelmas Term, 1478, for 8 marks (<I>Placita de Banco</I>, Roll 868, m. 96). John Shynner of Modbury, chaplain, had a suit for debt with Robert Tolloke (<I>Early Chancery Pro|ceedings</I>, 66/86, date 1475-80). This letter is probably rather earlier than No. 301, in which case it may perhaps belong to 1481. Shynner in some places wrote "d" (meaning &eth;) for "th". From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 202.</HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>303. THOMAS BANKE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 16 JANUARY [1482]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Thomas Banke was an Oxford D.D., who was Rector of Lincoln College 1493-1509, and Commissary of the University in 1501 and 1502. "My lord Edward" was one of the younger sons of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. In Oct., 1480, the University desired of Edward IV that he would send his nephew, "the lord Edward Pole," to study at Oxford. They also asked the Bishop of Salisbury to use his influence. In March, 1481, it was reported that the Bishop would bring him there. On 28 March, 1482, the University wrote to the King praising his nephew's gifts of intellect and heart. In another letter in the same year they repeated their praise, and thanked the King "quod Magistrum Stanley, infantem etiam nobilem atque litterarum studiosum illi prenobili nepoti tuo studiorum suorum comitem adjunxeris". Edward de la Pole cannot have been more than fourteen when he went to Oxford. He was Archdeacon of the East Riding from 15 Oct., 1480, to 6 Jan., 1485, when he became Archdeacon of Richmond; he died not long after. (See <I>Epistolae Academicae</I>, ii, 454-6, 462-3, 478, 484.) Master Stanley was James, son of Thomas Stanley (afterwards Earl of Derby). He was first cousin to Sir William Stonor's third wife, Anne Neville, and was somewhat older than Edward de la Pole. He was bishop of Ely from 1506 till his death in 1515 (<I>Dict. Nat. Biog.</I>, liv, 70). As to Sutton see No. 280. For Master Edmund see No. 194. The references show that the date of the letter must be either 1482 or 1483. Comparison with the reference to the troubles of Stonor's servants at Oxford in the next letter suggests that the former year is the more likely. From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 133.</HEADNOTE>

Since Stonor is a knight the date cannot be earlier than 1478; but neither that year, when 2nd Feb. was on a Monday, nor 1479, when it was on a Tuesday, are likely.

<HEAD>310. RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [1482]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>From the reference to Lady Stonor being with child the date is probably early in 1482. This letter appears to be later than No. 309 and earlier than No. 321. John Barantyne, who married Stonor's sister Mary (see No. 294), was returned as 14 years of age and more in October, 1474; at the date of this letter he seems to have been still under age, so cannot have been born before 1461; the <I>Inquisition</I> is quite possibly inaccurate. "Lady Botiller" is his mother, who married as her second husband Sir John Boteler; she is called "my lady Barantyne" in the next letter. The Barantyne manor of Chalgrove was held in part of the Prince of Wales as of the manor of Wal|lingford (<I>Chancery Inq. p.m.</I> Edward IV., file 50, no. 36); hence the refer|ence in these letters to the ravishment of his ward.

<HEAD>313. HUGH UNTON TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [11 MAY, 1482]</HEAD><HEADNOTE>From the reference to the King's going northwards, the date would seem to be May, 1482. Edward went to Fotheringhay about the end of May in that year (Ramsay, <I>Lancaster and York</I>, ii, 443). The intended date given in this letter is Whit-Tuesday, i.e. 28 May. The probable date for the letter itself is therefore Saturday, 11 May. As to the Worthe lawsuit, see Nos. 266-8, and 272. There is no reference to it in the "De Banco" Rolls for Easter and Trinity terms, 1482.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Nor in the corresponding Rolls for 1480 or 1481.</NOTE> There is, however, a record in Easter term of a successful suit brought by Worthe against Humphrey Veysy claiming messuages and lands in Crowthorne and Kynecote Hille, as heir of Agnes, daughter of John Wynnard; these lands had descended to her from John and Agnes Bevyle (<I>Placita de Banco</I>, Roll 880, mm. 447, 448; see also <I>Coram Rege</I>, Rolls 868, m. 141, and 869, m. 98; Trinity and Michaelmas terms, 1478, as to Elizabeth, wife of Thomas Worth, and Agnes, wife of John Wydeslade, heiresses of Humphrey Bevyle).

<PB REF="00000382.tif" N="146, vol. 2"> William Stonor had suits against Henry Felowe of Huchynden, Oxfordshire, and John Barell of Princes Risborough for trespass, and against Robert Emond of Hembury also for trespass (<I>Placita de Banco</I>, Roll 881, mm. 71, 197). His "mater anendes the Qwene" is explained by a suit which was pending against him for payment of 1000 marks under a bond dated 20th February, 1477 (<I>id</I>. Roll 881, m. 431). This suit which was already threatened in 1481 (<I>id</I>. Roll 877, m. 26) was then postponed to Michaelmas and finally to Hilary Term, 1483, see also Nos. 319 and 320.

The original is only a rough draft. The dispute seems to have originated in the purchase by Sir William Stonor (in 1479) from Peter Mar|myon of the manor of Beamys with manors, lands, and tenements in Shenyng|feld, Swalowefeld, Farley, Sydenham, Tronkewell, Foxhill, and Sheperygge in Berks. and Wilts, and of the manor of Nustelyngis in Hampshire. Part of the consideration was the grant by Stonor of an annual rent of 5 marks for life from Horton to Eleanor, wife of Peter Marmyon. There were similar grants of 100<I>s</I>. to Robert, and of 40<I>s</I>. each to John and Peter, sons of Peter Mar|myon (see <I>Ch. Misc.</I>, 37, ix, 40). The "Requests" here given come from <I>Ch.

<HEAD>331. SIMON STALLWORTH TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 21 JUNE, 1483</HEAD><HEADNOTE>Printed in <I>Excerpta Historica</I>, pp. 16, 17. The greater part of the letter, down to "menne of my lord," is not in Stallworth's writing. Sir Clements Markham (<I>Life of Richard III</I>, p. 214) has argued that: "As Saturday was the 21st, Friday last was the 20th. We have here evidence that Lord Hastings was not beheaded until a week after his arrest. . . . The story of Morton about the hurried execution on the 13th, and the log of wood, is there|fore false." Dr. Gairdner (<I>Eng. Hist. Review</I>, vi, 454) contested this con|clusion. But the fact that the letter was written in two hands affords an easy explanation; the first part may well have been written on Friday, the 20th, and the end added by Stallworth on the Saturday. This also explains the 
<PB REF="00000397.tif" N="161, vol. 2"> change of Stallworth's opinion as to the likelihood of the early release of the bishops. Compare, however, the dating of No. 174 on "All Soules dai last past". From <I>A.C.</I>, xlvi, 207.</HEADNOTE>
