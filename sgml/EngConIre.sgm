<P><HI REND="i">The English Conquest of Ireland</HI> was keyboarded  with an error rate within 1 in error in 20,000 characters.  All material except the glossary and index in the back matter is included and is represented in the electronic edition as it was in the print edition (so far as is possible). Subsequent to a review of  5% of the text by Catherine E. Paul, the text was marked up by Kenneth Church and the markup reviewed by Catherine Paul.</P><P>The long note that appears on page [vi], facing the first page of the "Forwords," is intended as a continuation of the note on page vii and has been inserted as a part of that note, occurring after "...other consonant and vowels" on the first page.  Some of the page numbers in the "Forwords" (x-xii) appear twice because the parallel quotes in the printed text have been rendered in succession in the electronic edition.</P><P>All chapter heads have been supplied by the editor, F.J. Furnivall, except those for chs. XXVII, XXIX, and LI in the Dublin MS. and chs. XXVII and XXIX in the Rawlinson MS. (pp. 64, 70 and 128 respectively of the former, and pp. 65 and 71 of the latter MS.).  All text that appears in brackets has been supplied by Furnivallr.  Although such is not stated explicitly in the "Forwords," we have assumed that the editor has supplied all text in parentheses from other MSS.</P><P>Occasionally, the exact location of milestone markers is unclear in Furnivall's edition; in those instances, we have inserted them according to our best judgment (e.g. Rawlinson MS., p. 27, fol. 6a or p. 133, fol. 25a).  The temporary change in milestone marker units from folio to leaf (Dublin MS.) conforms to their usage in the printed edition.  In three instances a milestone marker occurs within a word, and in each case the word has been joined in the electronic edition and placed before the milestone. In two cases the word in the printed edition is routinely hyphenated, and the hyphen has been retained  (Dublin MS. p. 20, fol. 4b; Rawl. MS., p. 113, fol. 21b). In one case the word is not routinely hyphenated, and the hyphen has been omitted (Rawl. MS., p. 149, fol. 28a).  Words that are broken by a page break have been joined and placed before the page break; if the word is regularly hyphenated, the hyphen has been retained (e.g. p. 21, Rawl. MS.).</P><P>In two instances (Dublin MS., p. 96; Rawl. MS., p. 23), a footnote marker has been omitted from the printed text; therefore we have inserted the corresponding footnote by the word "fawes" (p. 96) and 'The maystyr" (p. 23).  In the several cases where Furnivall supplies a long passage in Latin in a note corresponding to a passage in the English text that he sets off by two note markers (i.e. 1-1), one at the beginning and one at the end of the passage, we have copied the English text, placed it in quotation marks, and inserted it in the note just before the latin text (e.g. p. 33, Rawlinson MS.).</P><P>Six ampersands with macrons, which appeared on one page of the printed edition, but nowhere else in the text, are encoded as plain ampersands.</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE N="Latin" ID="l">Latin</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="Greek" ID="g">Greek</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE>

<PB N="vii"><HEAD>FOREWORDS.</HEAD><DIV2 TYPE="section"><P>THE first manuscript of this interesting story of "oure knyghten gestes yn Irlande" (92/15), and of Henry II's Conquest of our sister Isle, was sent over to me from the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, by Dr. John K. Ingram, to be copied, printed, and edited by him for the Early English Text Society.  He hoped to do his work at it during his July-September holiday (1893) in Scotland, on Loch Lomond, I having read his proofs with the MS. for him.  But illness prevented him; and so I (as the Society's man-of-all-work) had to take the book up.  Both the story told&mdash;mainly, though freely, from the <HI REND="i">Expugnacio Hibernica</HI> of Giraldus Cambrensis,&mdash;and the forms of the words, interested me. For the copier of the englisht text has often slipt into his own Irish dialect, specially in the use of <HI REND="i">d</HI> and <HI REND="i">t</HI> for <HI REND="i">th</HI>, and has written <HI REND="i">dynge</HI><NOTE>88/27; 134/13.</NOTE> and <HI REND="i">tynge</HI><NOTE>24/14; 28/8; (no)tynge 8/12; 16/5; 20/9; &amp;c.;</NOTE> for thing; <HI REND="i">drogh</HI><NOTE>14/8.</NOTE> and <HI REND="i">trogh</HI><NOTE>22/6, 7; 26/1, &amp;c.</NOTE>for <HI REND="i">through</HI>; <HI REND="i">day</HI> for <HI REND="i">they</HI><NOTE>10/19; 12/21; 24/10, 11.</NOTE>; <HI REND="i">idrow</HI> (18/1) for <HI REND="i">thrown</HI>; <HI REND="i">tanked</HI>for <HI REND="i">thanked</HI> (14/19); <HI REND="i">tynke</HI> for <HI REND="i">think</HI> (6/26); <HI REND="i">toght</HI> for <HI REND="i">thought</HI>(16/25, 18/7); <HI REND="i">tough</HI> (as once in The Three King's Sons) for <HI REND="i">though</HI> (22/14); &amp;c.

<PB N="viii">Part II. of this book, when complete, and will no doubt be finisht in 1894, or '95.</P><P>As it was now and then hard to understand the Dublin text, and one nearer the standard tongue turnd up in the Rawlinson MS. B. 490--the MS. that contains one of Mr. Steele's text of the prose <HI REND="i">Secreta</HI>&mdash;I got Mrs. Parker to copy this Bodleian MS.<NOTE>Mr. George Parker has collated the proofs with the MS.  Mr. Thomas Austin has made the Glossary and Indexes to both Texts.  Dr. Ingram wrote the English side-notes to the even pages 10-32, tho I've alterd 2 or 3 of em.</NOTE>, and the Clarendon Press to set it opposite the Dublin one.  The comparison of the two versions is full of interesting points, as the Rawlinson is generally less archaic than the Dublin<NOTE>I suppose the first englishing now represented by the Dublin MS. was made in the 14th century.</NOTE>, while each helps to fill up the other's occasional leavings-out.  There is at least one other MS. of the <HI REND="i">Conquest</HI>, the later one in Trinity College, Dublin, F. 4. 4, which is said to be a 16th century transcript of E. 2. 31.  From it, an extract is given below, pp. xiv-xvi as a specimen.  Doubtless, other MSS. of the text exist elsewhere.  Luckily for us, the late Rev. Jas. F. Dimock re-edited the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Expugnatio Hibernica</FOREIGN> in vol. v. (1867) <HI REND="i">Giraldi Cambrensis Opera</HI> in the Rolls Series of <HI REND="i">Chronicles and Memorials</HI>; and his notes, dates, and Preface have been of the greatest use to me.  He says (p. xxix) that there are two editions, and perhaps a third, of the <HI REND="i">Expugnacio</HI>: (1) that in an early 13th century MS. at Lambeth, No. 371, "probably penned during Giraldus's lifetime" (p. xxxi), and in (R.) and (B.), MSS. Bibl. Reg. 13 B. viii in the British Museum, and Rawlinson B. 188 in the Bodleian.  In treating the two latter MSS. as of the first cast of the work, Mr. Dimock neglects the marginal additions of the Royal MS.  These additions make (2) the second version of the <HI REND="i">Expugnacio</HI>(pp. xxxii, xxxiv), shown in (R.), and MS. Ff. 1. 27, in the University Library, Cambridge, in which "there is one whole chapter, (also in our English, p. 38-40 below) the eighteenth of the first book--giving the account of the synod at Armagh in 1170, of which no other mention is known besides this,
<PB N="ix">in this chapter of Giraldus--which is not in Lambeth 371, but is in Bibl. Reg. 13 B. viii and Rawlinson B. 188."</P><P>We now come to the MS. of most interest to us, Harleian 177, for in it only (as I gather from Mr. Dimock's note 3, p. 236) is the original of one of our English bits on pp. 16, 18 below:&mdash;</P><BIBL>Trin.

The omissions are more especially of the extraneous matter, not relating to Ireland; but there is much curtailing also of Irish matter, when not directly historical.  In the descriptions of the heroes, for instance, much often is left out; and in the orations which Giraldus puts into their mouths, still more.  The compiler of it never condenses, but simply omits.  In an oration ... he will retain two or three sentences of the beginning, and two or three more of the end, with perhaps another or two out of the middle, if not very much less than all this, word for word as in the complete oration, without much care about connection or sense ... it certainly is only an abbreviation, such as I describe it.</P></Q><P>This is just the case with our English text<NOTE>It stops at chapter 34 of Book II (75 of our pages go to 171 of the Rolls <HI REND="i">Giraldus</HI>).</NOTE>, though here and there it has bits not in Harl. 177.  As to that MS., Mr. Dimock continues, pp. xxxv-vi:</P><P>"It generally agrees closely, as I have said, with the second 
<PB N="x">edition, as in (R.) and (F.); but it exhibits a somewhat more advanced text.  For instance, the word <FOREIGN LANG="l">Stadia</FOREIGN> of (L)ambeth MS. occurs only twice instead of four times, out of eight as in (R)awlinson MS.: and instead of <FOREIGN LANG="l">Arcarii</FOREIGN> always, as in the early manuscripts, it has the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Satellites equestres</FOREIGN> of the later ones, in about half the instances where the words occur.  And, moreover, in a few instances, it has a word or two that are not in the early manuscripts, but are in the later ones.</P><P>This manuscript has no note whatever as to its history; but it, or its original perhaps, would seem to have been written by one of the English settlers in Ireland, as it attempts occasionally, instead of Giraldus's Latin of all the other manuscripts, to give an English rendering of the Irish names.  Thus, instead of <FOREIGN LANG="l">Murchardi filius</FOREIGN>, or <FOREIGN LANG="l">Dermitius</FOREIGN>, or <FOREIGN LANG="l">Murchardides</FOREIGN>, it has 'Macmorthit' or 'Macmorhith'; instead of <FOREIGN LANG="l">Ororicius</FOREIGN>, 'Oroch.'  In one instance the writer appears to make a blunder in his Englishing: he renders Otuethelis 'Oneyl' instead of O'Toole.... It is not the work of a very correct scribe."</P><P>As a sample of the cutting-down, by Harl. 177, of Giraldus's descriptions of men, take the most trenchant instance, that of Henry II.  In the Rolls edition, this description takes nearly six big octavo pages, <HI REND="i">Op</HI>. v. 301-6, the whole of Chapter 46, Book I.

Some late Irish writers, under the reaction perhaps of his having been found too much fault with, seem to me to put more faith in Giraldus's history than it really deserves." </Q></P></DIV2><DIV2 TYPE="section">

The&ydot; arr&ydot;ved at a place called Dondoneuile, foure myle besouthe the hawen of Waterforde; and there the&ydot; arrearede a diche, and a feble castell upon, of yards and <CORR SIC="?

The men of Waterforde, and with them Malaughl&ydot;ne Ofolane, the&ydot; did understande that the&ydot; had such Neighbourehede which them lothed: the&ydot; concluded that the&ydot; would upon them, or enny more weare to them come.  the&ydot; assembled them together, well thre thowsande men, and wente over the water of sure, that partethe the twoe counties of le&ydot;nester and of Mounester, and sett them in thre hosts, bouldel&ydot; for to assaile the Engl&ydot;shmen within there Castell.  Re&ydot;mounde and his men, thoughe the&ydot; weare but fewe, the&ydot; weare not fainte to fighte with uneven hoste, the&ydot; assemblede them together; But, as noe wonder was, soe fewe men mighte nat fighte againste soe man&ydot;; theie turned them againe to there receipte.  the other, thinkinge that the&ydot; departed in discomfeture, the&ydot; brake there sheldrun, and followed them: and the&ydot; weare not full&ydot; within the gate, but some of them weare rather in <SUPPLIED>than</SUPPLIED> thengl&ydot;she men.  Reymonde sawe that he and his weare in greate perill, and upon pointe to losse there l&ydot;ves.  he cried to his fellowes, and turned worthel&ydot; upon there foemen.  and the firste that came in, he clave his hedde, and throwl&ydot; killed him: all thoste
<PB N="xv">weare dyscomfitted, and toke them to flighte.  The others them followed into all the plaine, and la&ydot;de them one soe, that in litle while the&ydot; slowe of them f&ydot;ve hundreth and moe; and the moste parte of thother fell downe into the see from the hie roke, and drowne themselves.  in this fighte, was a knighte that heighte William fferande, that did over well, and above all other.  he was a man that hade semblante as thoughe he weare one the much yuell; and therfore he put him-selfe whear the moste perill was; for <SUPPLIED>he</SUPPLIED>raughte not whether death came betwen him and his &ydot;uell, or it weare overmuch <CORR SIC="? MS. suirtte">smitte</CORR>  upon him.  here the pride of Waterforde fell; all there mighte went to noughte: herof came the Englyshe hoppe and comforte; and to the Ir&ydot;she, dredd and wanhop; for it was never therbefore harde, that, of soe fewe men, soe greate a slaughter was done.  but unwise counsaile they did thereafter, that turned them to much crueltie; ffor when the Maystr&ydot; was all thers, and all there foemen overcom, In the fighte weare taken well threscore men and tenn, that them had yelded, and weare the higheste and the richeste men of all the C&ydot;tt&ydot;, such that the&ydot;e mighte have had the Citt&ydot; deliuered for them, or els asmuch Catell as the&ydot; woulde desire.  Henry of mountud, that to them was come, and Re&ydot;mounde, upon diuerse domes stroven whate they shoulde doe with there prisoners; ffor Reymounde travailede aboute for to deliuer them, as a man of Rewthefull mode, and thus saide to his fellowes: "Lordings, whate is us beste to doe with oure wreched prisoners?  I sa&ydot;e nat that one anny manner one shoulde spare his foemen; but the&ydot; be nat nowe oure foemene, but be men nat rebells, but in Battaile for to defende there county, overcome. me thinke the&ydot; are nowe in such state, that we oughte better to have merc&ydot;e of them, and g&ydot;ve them l&ydot;fe,&mdash;for to g&ydot;ve others example to be boxom,&mdash;then cruel&ydot; to doe them to deathe, wheare-throughe others, ffor feare of m&ydot;struste, the lesse will yeld them to us."  When Re&ydot;monde had theise wourds saide, in all the folke was amoste none to graunte them lyfe; Arose up Henry amonge
<PB N="xvi">them all, and this them saide: "I-noughe Remounde openl&ydot; to us hathe spoken of merc&ydot; and almosedede, how vnked<NOTE>["how vnked":] Afterwards written above the line in MS.</NOTE> landes are wonne; and not with slaughter and burnemge.  whether Alixandr and Julius Cesar, that weare lords of all the wourde, wonne lands b&ydot; such wa&ydot;, I woulde Re&ydot;mounde woulde me answere.  when the&ydot; came to us well arrayed for to fighte, yf theie had wone the overhande and overcome us, woulde the&ydot;, for almose and for rewth, haue had merc&ydot; one us? noe, I trowe not. therfore, but those one of twoe wayes: eyther doe manly that thinge whea<SUPPLIED>re</SUPPLIED>fore we bene come, and the folke that rebell againste us, with <SUPPLIED>out</SUPPLIED> any noyse, with weapone heartely bringe owt of dawes; otherwise, yf we shall doe almose-dede one them, and spare them, as Reymounde hath saide, lett us wend to oure shippes, and turne aga&ydot;ne; and lett we the wreched men houlde there lande, and Brouke it, without any challendge."  Henries dome licked them better then Reymonds; and the Cittizens weare demed to death.  They had noe wonte of waritrees; and therfore They ladd them to the clyffe of the see, and putt them downe, and drowned them.</P><P>of the firste goode adventure that him befell, the&ydot; that beste weare worth&ydot;e should haue there parte, and the hoste.  all the towne of wexforde, with the twoe nexte count&ydot;es, he gave to Roberte Stephensson and to Mor&ydot;ce fitz Geraude, as forwarde was to-for made.  other twoe nexte counties, he gaue to Henr&ydot; of Mount-morthie&mdash;nexte thay twoe, one the s&ydot;de towarde waterforde,&mdash;a knighte that came in that same flote, h&ydot;m &thorn;ridsome of knights, and came throughe thearle Richarde, more for to sp&ydot;e the land, then for to fighte.</P></DIV2></DIV1></FRONT><BODY>

Lastly, Giraldus asks that a scholar may translate his books into French; gives Walter Map's opinion on his own talk and Giraldus's writings; and says that he (Giraldus) is now old, and 'desires only God's favour and the appreciation of his labours by posterity.'</P><MILESTONE N="---------------" UNIT="typographic"><P>pp. 144-5, lines 9-2 from foot.
