<HEAD>CHAPTER I. THE DEFERENCE BI TWENE DOMINIUM REGALE AND DOMINIUM POLITICUM ET REGALE.</HEAD>
<P>THER bith ij kyndes off kyngdomes, of the wich that on is a lordship callid in laten <B>dominium regale</B>, and that other is callid <B>dominium politicum et regale</B>. And thai diuersen in that the first kynge mey rule his peple bi suche lawes as he makyth hym self. And therfore he mey sett vppon thaim tayles and other imposicions, such as he wol hym self, with owt thair assent. The secounde kynge may not rule his peple bi other lawes than such as thai assenten unto. And therfore he mey sett vpon thaim non imposi|cions with owt thair owne assent. This diuersite is wel taught bi Seynt Thomas, in his boke wich he wrote <B>ad regem Cipri de regemine principum</B>. But yet it is more openly tredid in a boke callid <B>compendium moralis philosophie</B>, and sumwhat bi Giles in his boke <B>de regemine principum</B>. The childeryn of Israell, as saith Seynt Thomas, aftir that God hade chosen thaim <B>in populum peculiarem et regnum sacerdotale</B>, were ruled bi hym vndir Juges <B>regaliter et politice</B>, in to the tyme that thai desired to haue a kynge, as tho hade al the gentiles, wich we cal peynymes, that hade no kynge but a man that reigned vppon thaim <B>regaliter tantum</B>. With wich desire God was gretly offendyd, as wele for thair folie, as for thair vnkyndnes; that 
<PB REF="00000134.tif" N="110"> sithyn thai had a kynge, wich was God, that reigned vppon thaim politekily and roialy, and yet wold chaunge hym for a kynge, a verray man, that wolde reigne vpon hem only roialy. And therfore God manassynge hem made them to be ferde bi thondres and o&thorn;er gasteful thynges from the hevene. And whan thai wolde not therby lefe thair folissh desire, he charged &thorn;e profet Samuel to declare vnto them the lawe of such a kynge as thai askyd; wich amonge o&thorn;er thynges said that he wolde take from thaim thair lande and gyf it to his servantes, and sett thair childeryn in his cartis, and do to thaim such o&thorn;er many harmeful thinges, as in the viij<SUP>th</SUP> chapiter of the first boke of kynges it mey apere. Wher as bi fore that tyme, while thai were ruled bi God roialy and politikely vndir Juges, it was not lefull to any man for to take from thaim any of thaire godis, or to greve thair childeren &thorn;at hade not offendid. Wereby it mey appere that in tho dayis <B>regimen politicum et regale</B> was distyngued <B>a regemine tantum regale</B>; and that it was bettir to the peple to be ruled politekely and roialy, than to be ruled only roialy. Seynt Thomas also in his said boke prasith <B>dominium politicum et regale</B>, bi cause the prince that reigneth bi such lordshippe mey not frely falle into tyrannye, as mey the prince that reigneth <B>regaliter tantum</B>. And yet thai both bith egall in estate and in poiar, as it mey lightly be shewed and provid by infallyble reason.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. WHI OON KING REGNETH REGALITER, AND ANOTHER POLITICE ET REGALITER.</HEAD>
<P>HIT mey peraventur be mervellid be some men, whi on reaume is a lordeshippe only roialle, and the prince therof rulith it bi his lawe callid <B>Jus regale</B>; and a nother kyngdome is a lordshippe roiall and politike, and the prince therof rulith hit bi a lawe callid <B>Jus polliticum et regale</B>; sithin thes ij princes bith of egal estate. To this doute it mey be an|swerde in this maner. The first institucion of thes ij realmes vppon the incorperacion of thaim is cause of this diuersite. Whan Nembroth be myght for his owne glorie made and incorperate the first realme, and subdued it to hymself bi tyrannye, he wolde not have it gouernyd bi any o&thorn;er rule or lawe, but bi his owne wille; bi wich and for the accom|plisshment &thorn;erof he made it. And therfore though he hade thus made hym a realme, holy scripture disdeyned to call hym a kynge, <B>quia rer dicitur a regendo</B>; wich thynge he did not, but oppressyd the peple bi myght, and therfore he was a tirraunt and callid <B>primus tirrannorum</B>. But holy write callith hym <B>robustus benator coram Domino</B>. Ffor as the hunter takyth the wilde beste for to sle and ete hym, so Nembroth subdued to hym the peple with myght, to haue &thorn;er seruice and thair godis, vsing vppon thaim the lord|shippe that is callid <B>dominium regale tantum</B>. Aftir hym Belus that was first callid a kynge, aftir hym is 
<PB REF="00000136.tif" N="112"> sone Ninus, and aftir hym other paynemes, &thorn;at bi ensample of Nembroth made hem realmes, wolde not haue thaim ruled bi o&thorn;er lawes then be ther owne wylles. Wich lawes ben right gode vndir gode princes, and thair kyngdomes bethe than most resembled to the kyngdome of God, wich reigneth vpon man rulynge hym bi his owne will. Wherfore mony cristen princes vsen the same lawe; and ther|fore it is that &thorn;e lawes seyn, <B>quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem</B>. And thus I suppose first be gan in Realmes <B>dominium tantum regale</B>. But aftirwarde, whan mankynde was more mansuete, and bettir dis|posid to vertu, grete comunaltes, as was the felow|shippe that came in to this lande with Brute, willynge to be vnite and made a body pollitike callid a reawme, hauynge an hed to gouerne it;&mdash;as aftir the saynge of the philisopher, euery comunalte vnyed of mony parties must nedis haue an hed;&mdash;than they chese the same Brute to be &thorn;er hed and kynge. And thai and he vpon this incorperacion, institucion, and onynge of hem self in to a reaume, ordenyd the same reaume to be ruled and justified by suche lawes as thai all wolde assent vnto; wich lawe therfore is callid <B>polliticum</B>, and bi cause it is ministrid bi a kynge, it is callid <B>regale</B>. <I>Policia dicitur a</I> <B>poles</B>, <I>quod est plures, et</I> <B>ycos</B>, <I>scientia; quo regimen politicum dicitur</I> <B>regimen plurium scientia siue consilio ministratum</B>. The kynge of Scottis reignith vppon is peple bi this lawe, <I>videlicet</I>, <B>regemine politico et regali</B>. And as Dio|dorus Siculus saith in is boke <B>de priscis historiis</B>, the reawme of Egipte is ruled bi the same lawe, and therfore the kynge therof chaungith not his lawes with owt the assent of his peple. And in like fourme as he saith is ruled the kyngdome of Saba in <I>Felici</I> 
<PB REF="00000137.tif" N="113"> <I>Arabia</I>, and the londe of Libie; and also the more parte of all the reawmes of Affrike. Wich maner rule and lordshippe the said Diodorus in that boke praisith gretly; ffor it is not only good for the prince, that mey therby &thorn;e more surely do justice than bi is owne arbitrment; but it is also good for his peple &thorn;at resseyue thair bi such justice as thai desire thaim self. Now as me semyth it is shewid openly ynough, whi on kynge reignith vpon is peple <B>dominio tantum regali</B>, and that other reignith <B>dominio politico et regali</B>; ffor that on kyngdome be ganne of and bi the might of the prince, and that o&thorn;er be ganne bi the desire and institucion of the peple of the same prince.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. HERE BIEN SHEWED THE FRUYTES OF JUS REGALE AND THE FRUYTES OF JUS POLITICUM ET REGALE.</HEAD>
<P>AND how so be it that &thorn;e Ffrenche kynge reignith vppon is peple <B>dominio regali</B>, yet Seynt Lowes some tyme kynge ther, nor eny of his progenitors sette neuer tayles or o&thorn;er imposicion vppon the peple of &thorn;at lande with owt the assent of &thorn;e iij estates, wich whan thai bith assembled bith like to the courte of the parlement in Ingelonde. And this ordre kepte many of his successours in to late dayis, that Ingelonde men made suche warre in Ffraunce, that the iij estates durst not come to gedre. And than for 
<PB REF="00000138.tif" N="114"> that cause and for gret necessite wich the Ffrench kynge hade of goode for the defence of &thorn;at lande, he toke vpon hym to sett tayles and o&thorn;er imposicions vpon the commons with owt the assent of the iij estates; but yet he wolde not sett any such charges, nor hath sette, vppon the nobles for fere of rebillion. And bi cause the commons &thorn;er, though thai haue grucched, haue not rebellid or beth hardy to rebelle, the Ffrench kynges haue yerely sithyn sette such charges vpon them, and so augmented the same charges, as the same commons be so impouerysshid and distroyed, &thorn;at thai mowe vnneth leve. Thai drinken water, thai eyten apples, with brede right browne made of rye; thai eyten no flesshe but yf it be right seldon a litle larde, or of the entrales and heydes of bestis slayn for the nobles and marchauntes of the lande. Thai weren no wolen, but yf it be a pouere cote vndir thair vttermest garnement, made of grete caunuas, and callid a frokke. Thair hausyn beth of lyke caunuas, and passyn not thair kne, wher fore thai beth gartered and ther theis bare. Thair wyfes and childeren gone bare fote; thai mowe in non o&thorn;er wyse leve. For somme of thaim &thorn;at were wont to pay to his lorde for his tenement, wich he hiryth by the yere, a scute, payith nowe to the kynge ouer &thorn;at scute .v. scutes. Wher thurgh thai be arted bi necessite so to wacch, labour, and grubbe in the ground for thair sustenance, that thair nature is wasted, and the kynde of hem broght to noght. Thai gon crokyd, and ben feble, not able to fight, nor to defende &thorn;e realme; nor thai haue wepen, nor money to bie thaim wepen with all. But verely thai liven in the most extreme pouertie and miserie, and yet dwellyn thai in on the most fertile reaume of the 
<PB REF="00000139.tif" N="115"> worlde. Werthurgh the Ffrench kynge hath not men of his owne reaume able to defende it, except his nobles, wich beyren non such imposicions, and ther fore thai ben right likely of thair bodies; bi wich cause the said kynge is compellid to make his armeys and retenues for the defence of his lande of straungers, as Scottes, Spaynardes, Arrogoners, men of Almeyn, and of o&thorn;er nacions, or ellis all his enymes myght ouerrenne hym; for he hath no defence of his owne except is castels and fortresses. Lo this is the frute of his <B>Tus regale</B>. Yf the reaume of Englonde, wich is an Ile, and therfor mey not lyghtly geyte soucore of other landes, were rulid vndir such a lawe, and vndir such a prince, it wolde be than a pray to all o&thorn;er nacions &thorn;at wolde conqwer, robbe, or deuouir it; wich was well provid in the tyme of the Bretons, when the Scottes and the Pyctes so bete and oppressid this lande, &thorn;at the peple therof sought helpe of the Romayns, to whom thai hade be tributori. And when thai coude not be defende be thaym, thai sought helpe of the Duke of Bretayn tho called litle Bretayn, and grauntid ther|fore to make his brother Costantyne &thorn;er kynge. And so he was made kynge here, and reigned many yeres, and his childirren aftir hym, of wich gret Artour was one of thair issue. But blessyd be God, this lande is rulid vndir a bettir lawe; and therfore the peple therof be not in such peynurie, nor ther by hurt in thair persons, but thai bith welthe, and haue all thinges nescessarie to the sustenance of nature. Wherfore thai ben myghty, and able to resiste the aduersaries of this reaume, and to beete o&thorn;er reaumes that do, or wolde do them wronge. Lo this is the fruyt of <B>Tus polliticum et regale</B>, vndre wich we live.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. HERE IS SHEWED HOW THE REUENUES OF FFRAUNCE BYN MADE GRETE.</HEAD>
<P>SITHYN our kynge reignith vpon vs be lawes more fauerable and good to vs, &thorn;an be the lawes by the whiche &thorn;e Ffrench kynge rulith his peple, hit is reason &thorn;at we be to hym more good and more profitable than be the sugettes of the Ffrench kynge vnto hym; wich it wolde seme that we be not, con|siderynge &thorn;at his subiecttes yelden to hym more in a yere, than we do to owre soferayn lorde in ij yeres, how so be it &thorn;at thai do so ayenst thar willes. Neuer the lesse when it is considerid, how a kynges office stondith in ij thynges, on to defende his reaume ayen &thorn;air enemyes outwarde bi the swerde; an other that he defende his peple ayenst wronge doers inwarde bi justice, as hit apperith bi the said first boke of kynges; wich &thorn;e Ffrench kynge dothe not, though he kepe Justice be twene subiet and subget; sithin he oppressith thaim more hym self, than wolde haue done all the wronge doers of &thorn;e reaume, &thorn;ough thai hade no kynge. And sithyn it is a synne to gyve no meyte, drynke, clothynge or other almes to hem that haue nede, as shal be de|clared in the day off dome; how muche a greter 
<PB REF="00000141.tif" N="117"> synne is it to take from the pore man is meyte, is drinke, his clothynge, and all that he hath nede off. Wich werely doth the Ffrench kynge to mony a thowsande of his subiectes, as it is be fore openly declared. Wich thynge &thorn;ough it be nowe colourid <B>per jus regale</B>, yet it is tyranne. Ffor, as Seynt Thomas saith, whan a kynge rulith his reaume only to his owne profite, and not to the good off is subiectes, he is a tyrant. Kynge Heroude reignid vppon &thorn;e Jues <B>dominio regali;</B> yet when he slowe the childeren off Israell, he was in that a tyrant, though the lawes seen, <B>quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem</B>. Wherfore Acab, wich reigned vppon the childeren of Israell bi like lawe, and desired to haue hade Nabothe his subgectes vyne yerde, wolde not by that lawe take it ffrom hym, but proferid hym the value thereof. Ffor theys wordes seid to the pro|fete, <B>predic eis jus regis</B>, beth not ellis to say but, <B>predic eis potestatem regis</B>. Wher fore as ofte as such a kynge dothe any thynge ayenst the lawe of God, or ayenst &thorn;e lawe off nature, he dothe wronge, not with stondynge the said lawe declared by the prophete. And it is so, that the lawe off nature woll in this case, &thorn;at the kynge shulde do to his subgettes, has he wolde ben done to hym self, yff he were a subget; wich mey not be that he wolde be almost distroied as bith &thorn;e commons off Ffraunce. Wherfore, al be it that the Ffrench kynges reuenues ben by suche meanes moche gratter than be the revenues wich &thorn;e kynge owre souerayn lorde hath off vs, yet thai ben not goodly taken, and the myght of his reaume is nerehande distroyed ther by.

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. THE HARME THAT COMYTH OFF A KYNGES POVERTE.</HEAD>
<P>FFIRST, yff a kynge be pore, he shall bi nescessite make his expences, and by all &thorn;at is necessarie to his estate, by creaunce and borowynge; wher through his creauncers wolle wynne vpon hym the iiij<SUP>th</SUP> or the v<SUP>th</SUP> pene of all that he dispendith. And so he shall lese whan he payith, the iiij<SUP>th</SUP> or the v<SUP>th</SUP> pene of his revenues, and thus be ther by alway porer and porer, as vser and chevisaunce encressith the pouerte off hym that borowith. His creauncers shul alway grucche ffor lake of thair paymente, and defame his highnes off mysgouernance, and defaute of kepynge of days; wich yf he kepe, he most borowe also much at the dayis, as he didd firste; ffor he shalbe than pouerer than he was by the value of the iiij<SUP>th</SUP> or v<SUP>th</SUP> parte of his first expences, and so be alway pouerer and pouerer, vnto the tyme he be the pouerest lorde of his lande. Ffor such maner of borowynge makith the grete lordis to 
<PB REF="00000143.tif" N="119"> be pouerer than thair tenantes. What dishonour is this, and abatynge of the glorie of a kynge. But yet it is most to his vnsuyrte. For his subgettes woll rather goo with a lorde &thorn;at is riche, and mey pay thair wages and expenses, then with thair kynge &thorn;at hath noght in his purse, but thai most serue hym, yf thai wil do so, at thair owne dispenses. <B>Item</B>, yf the kynge be pouere, he shall of necessite make his giftes and rewardes by asseignementes, for wich he shall haue but litle thanke. For the pouere man hade leuer an c. marke in hande, then an c. li. bi asseignement, wich perauentur shall cost hym right miche or he can gete his payment, and per|auentur be neuer paid therof. And often tymes for lake of money the kynge shall be fayne to gyf awey his lande to such as wolde haue ben feyner of a c. li in hand, than of xl. li worth lande yerely, to the grete abatynge of his revenues and depopolacion of his reaume. But the grettest harme that comyth of a kynges pouerte is, that he shal bi necessite be arted to fynde exquysite meanes of geytinge of good; as to putt defaute in some of his subgettes &thorn;at bith innocentes, and vpon the riche men more &thorn;en the pore, by cause that he mey bettir pay; and to shew rigoure &thorn;er as fauour awght to be shewid, and fauour &thorn;er as rigour shuld be shewid, to per|version of Justice, and perturbacion of the peas and quiete of the reaume. For, as the philosepher saith in his Eytikes, <B>Impossibile est indigentem operari bona</B>. Hit nedith not now to specifie mo of the harmes wich comyth to a reaume bi the pouerte of &thorn;er kynge, how be it thai bith mony mo than we haue shewid yet; for euery wise man mey se ham openly i now.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. ORDINANCE FFOR THE KYNGES ORDINARIE CHARGES.</HEAD>
<P>AND sithyn it is necessarie that the kynge be alway riche, wich may not be with owt he haue revenues sufficiant for the yerely mayntenance of his estate; it is behouefull that we furst esteme, what his erly charges and expences bith likely to drawe vnto. Ffor aftir that nedith his reuenues to be proporcioned; but yet thai nedun to be gretter than woll be the charges, for doute of soden cases, wich mey falle to hym and to his reaume. Ffor Seynt Bernarde saith, &thorn;at yf a mannes ex|penses be egall to his livelode, a soden chaunce mey distroye his estate. The kynges yerely ex|penses stonden in charges ordinarie, and in charges extra ordinarie. His charges ordinary mey not be eschewed, and therfore it nedith &thorn;at ther be lyvelode asseigned ffor the payment therof; wich lyvelode be in no wyse putte to no other vse. And yff it happen that any patent be made of any parte therof to o&thorn;er vse, &thorn;at thanne &thorn;at patent be voide and of non effect. Wich thynge yff hit be ffermely estableshed, the kynges ordinarie charges mey alway be paid in hande, and the pro vision ffor hem mey alway be made in seson; wich shalbe worth to the kynge the 
<PB REF="00000145.tif" N="121"> iiij<SUP>th</SUP> or the v<SUP>th</SUP> parte of the quantite of his expenses for ordinarie charges. This may in nothinge restrane the kyngis pover. Ffor it is no poiar to mowe aliene and put away; but it is power to mowe haue and kepe to hym self. As it is no poiar to mowe synne, and to do ylle, or to mowe to be seke, wex olde, or that a man may hurte hym self. Ffor all thes poiars comen of impotencie. And therfore thay mey properly by callid nown poiars. Wherfore the holy sprites and angels, &thorn;at mey not synne, wex old, be seke, or hurte ham selff, haue more poiar than we, that mey harme owre selff with all thes defautes. So is the kynges power more, in that he may not put ffrom hym possescions necessaries for his owne sustenance, than yff he myght put ham ffrom hym, and aliene the same to his owne hurte and harme. Nor this is ayen the kynges prerogatiff, be wich he is exaltid above his subgettes; but rather this is to hym a prerogatiff. Ffor no man saue he mey haue ayen the lande &thorn;at he hath onis aliened. This livelode asseigned ffor the ordinarie charges shall aftirwarde be neuer askid off the kyng, nor his highnes shall thynke ffor &thorn;at, that he hath &thorn;e more livelode to be given awey; but be reason hereoff he will &thorn;e more restrayn his yeftis off o&thorn;er off his livelod, considerynge &thorn;at than it woll not be grette, and therfore he shall haue more nede off it then thai that will aske it. The ordenarie charges, wich &thorn;e writer hereoff can nowe remenbr, be thies; the kynges housholde, his warderobe. And how so be it &thorn;at the kynge liste now, or will hereaftir, make his howshold lesse than it was wonned to be; yet his highnes shall &thorn;an haue therfore a bouute his persone, ffor his honour and suyrte, lordes, knyghtes, 
<PB REF="00000146.tif" N="122"> and sqviers, and o&thorn;er, in also grete nombr, or gretter than his howsolde was wonned to be, to his charges peraduentur also gretly, as his houshold well ruled was wonned to stonde hym inne. Wher fore here|inne it nedith not to considre or to purvey, but only ffor the kynges house, wich he may resume or chaunge in to his new maner, or other fourme at his pleasur, and as it shalbe thought aftir the seasons most expedient. The expenses off wich housholde mey sone be estemed by the wich off olde tyme haue be officers therin, and bi the clerkys off theschekquer. The secounde ordinarie charge is the payment off the wages and ffees off the kynges grete officers, his courtes, and his counsell. Wich charge woll alwey be grete, and thies men nedun to be alway redely payid. Ffor indigens in ham is not only vnworshipfull, but it mey do the most harme &thorn;at mey falle of eny nede in any estate of the lande, aftir the kynges most grete estate. &THORN;e thirde charge ordinarie is the payment of the kepyng of the marches, wher in we beyre moch gretter charges yerely than done the Scottis, wich often tymes is for the ffauour &thorn;at we do to the persones &thorn;at kepe ham, wich ffauoure &thorn;e Scottis do not. The iiij<SUP>th</SUP> charge is the kepyng off Caleis, wich charge is welynoghe knowen. &THORN;e v<SUP>th</SUP> charge is ffor the kynges werkes, off wich &thorn;e yerely expenses mey not be es|temede, but yet &thorn;e accoumptes off the clerkes off the werkes wollyn shewe &thorn;e likenes &thorn;eroff, wile &thorn;e kynge makith no new werkes. The kepynge off the see I reken not amonge the ordinarie charges, how be it the charge &thorn;eroff is yerely borne, bi cause it is not estimable, and the kynge hath therfore &thorn;e subsidie off pondage and tonnage. Nor the lesse 
<PB REF="00000147.tif" N="123"> be that reason pondage and tonnage mey not be rekenned as parcell off the revenues wich the kynge hath ffor the mayntenance off his estate, bi cause it aught to be applied only to &thorn;e kepynge off the see. And though we haue not alwey werre vppon the see, yet it shalbe nescessarie &thorn;at the kynge haue alway some ffloute apon the see, ffor the repressynge off rovers, sauynge off owre marchauntes, owre ffishers, and the dwellers vppon owre costes; and &thorn;at the kynge kepe alway some grete and myghty vessels, ffor the brekynge off an armye when any shall be made ayen hym apon &thorn;e see. Ffor thanne it shall be to late to do make such vessailles. And yet with owt thaym all the kynges navey shallnot suffice to borde with carrikkes and o&thorn;er grete ves|sailles, nor yet to mowe breke a myghty ffloute gadered off purpose. Now, as I suppose, we haue rekened &thorn;e grettest parte off the kynges ordinarie charges. Wherfore we woll considre next his extra ordinarie charges, also ferre as mey be possible to vs.</P>

<P>THE kynges extraordinarie charges bith so casuelle, &thorn;at no man mey knowe hem in certaynte. But yet he may esteme what somme thai bith not like to excede, but yff &thorn;er ffall a case ouer moch exorbitant; 
<PB REF="00000148.tif" N="124"> and than it shalbe reasone, and also necessarie, &thorn;at all the reaume beyre ffor &thorn;at case a synguler charge. Such off the said extraordinarie charges as the writer hereoff can now remenbr be theis. Ffirst &thorn;e kyng shall often tymes sende owt off this lande his ambassatours, as well to the pope, as to diuerse kynges, prynces, and nacions; and o&thorn;er while he shall sende his procuratours and messengers to the counselles generalles. Wich ambassatours, procura|tours, and messengers shall nede to be honerably accompanyed, and well be sene, alsowell ffor the worshippe off &thorn;e reaume, as ffor the avaunsynge off &thorn;e maters ffor wich thai shalbe sende, to &thorn;e kynges right grete charge, wich shalbe more or lesse, aftir thair longe or shorte demure in thair viage. <B>Item</B>, the kynge shall beyre yerely charges vnknowen in re ceyvinge off ligates and messengers sende ffrom the pope, and off ambassatours sende ffrom kynges and o&thorn;er princes, and also ffrom grete communalties bi yonde &thorn;e see, wich will putt &thorn;e kyng to grete expenses while thai bith here, and at thair depart|ynge thai most nedis haue grete giftes and rewardes; ffor &thorn;at be sitith &thorn;e kynges magnificence and liberalite, also it is necessarie ffor the worship off his reaume. <B>Item</B>, sithen it is not gode &thorn;at he rewarde such as do, and shall do to hym seruice, or o&thorn;er maner off pleasures, with &thorn;e possescions and revenues of his crovne, nor with other possescions off his inherit|ance;&mdash;ffor thai be moch more necessarie for the sustenance off his grete estate;&mdash;hit shall ther fore be necessarie, &thorn;at the kynge make such rewardes with money owt off his cofers, and &thorn;at somme off hem haue so largely &thorn;eroff, as thai mey bie thaim lande with all, yff thai will. Ffor be this meane &thorn;e 
<PB REF="00000149.tif" N="125"> kynges estate shall alwey be kept vnblemyshed. And off somme man is highnes shall haue more thanke ffor money then ffor lande; and also money is the most convenient rewarde to hym &thorn;at hath not longe serued. This charge woll all wey be grete, and so inestimable grete, &thorn;at in somme yere a grete lordes lyvelod shalnot suffice to beyre it, though he wolde selle grete parte &thorn;erof. And trewly, when &thorn;e kyng rewardith is servantes in this maner, he shewith grete ffauour to all his reaume. <B>Item</B>, it shall nede &thorn;at the kyng haue such tresour, as he mey make new bildynges whan he woll, ffor his pleasure and magnificence; and as he mey bie hym riche clothes, riche furres, o&thorn;er than be wonned to fall vndre &thorn;e yerely charges off his warderober, rich stones, serpes, bauderikes, and o&thorn;er juels and ornamentes conue|nyent to his estate roiall. And often tymes he woll bie riche hangynges and other apparell ffor his howses; vessaill, vestmentes, and o&thorn;er ornamentes for his chapell; bie also horses off grete price, trappers, and do other suche nobell and grete costes, as bi sitith is roiall mageste, off wich it is not now possible to the writer hereof to remenbr the especial|liteis. Ffor yff a kyng did not so, nor myght do, he lyved then not like his estate, but rather in miserie, and in more subgeccion than doth a priuate person. <B>Item</B>, the kynge shall often tymes sende his comis|sioners in gret myght, and also his juges, to represse and punysh riatours and risers; ffor wich cause he shall odre whiles ride in his owne person myghtely accompanyed. Wich thynge wolnot be done with owt grete costes; ffor no man is bounde to serue hym in suche cases at his owne dyspenses. <B>Item</B>, yff ther come a sodayne armye vpon this londe by see 
<PB REF="00000150.tif" N="126"> or by lande, &thorn;e kyng most encomptre them with a lyke armye, or a gretter; ffor &thorn;e expenses wheroff he shall not so sadanly haue any eyde off his peple. Wherfore he most than do the expences with money owt off his cofers, or put all is lande in jopardie. Loo now we haue remenbred grete parte off the kynges extraordinarie charges; and be ffore we haue shewid grete parte off his ordinarie charges. Wherfore now it is tyme &thorn;at it be shewid, how the kynge mey haue revenues and livelode sufficient to beyre theis ij charges.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. YFF THE KYNGES LIVELODE SUFFICE NOT, HIS SUBGETTES AUGHT TO MAKE HIT SUFFICIENT.</HEAD>
<P>HIT is shewid be ffore, how necessarie it is &thorn;at livelod sufficient be asseigned ffor the kynges ordi|narie charges, and that the same livelod be only applied therto, and not aliened in tyme comynge. Ffor that asseignement mey in no wise hurte &thorn;e kyng, considerynge &thorn;at yff any parte off &thorn;e revenues &thorn;eroff remayne ouer the paiement of the same ordynarie chargis, that so remaynynge is the kynges owne money, wich he mey than imploye to o&thorn;er vse at is owne pleasur. And it is vndouted that the kynge hath livelode sufficient wich mey be soo asseigned for his ordinarie charges. Wherfore we haue now no thyng ellis to be sercched, but what lyvelod &thorn;e kyng hath ffor the payment off his charges extraor|dinarie, ouer so moche livelod as shalbe asseigned 
<PB REF="00000151.tif" N="127"> ffor his charges ordinarie; and yff he haue not live|lod sufficient &thorn;erto, how than his livelod mey be made sufficient. Ffor his reaume is bounde by right to susteyne hym in euery thyng necessarie to his estate. Ffor, as Seynt Thomas saith, <B>Rex datur propter regnum, et non regnum propter regem.</B> Wherfore all that he dothe owith to be referred to his kyngdome. Ffor though his estate be &thorn;e highest estate temporall in &thorn;e erthe, yet it is an office, in wich he mynestrith to his reaume defence and justice. And therfore he mey say off hym selff and off his reaume, as the pope saith off hym selff and off the churche, in &thorn;at he writithe, <B>seruus seruorum Dei.</B> By wich reason, ryght as euery seruant owith to haue is sustenance off hym &thorn;at he serueth, so aught &thorn;e pope to be susteyned by the chirche, and the kyng by his reaume. Ffor <B>nemo debet propriis expensis militare.</B> And owre lorde saith, <B>dignus est operarius cibo suo.</B> Wherfore &thorn;e appostill saith, <B>commbnicet is qui cate&yogh;i&yogh;atur berbo, ei qui se cate&yogh;i&yogh;at, in omnibus bonis.</B> Wherfore sithen euery reaume is bounde to susteyn is kyng, yet moch more be we bounde ther to, vppon whom owre kyng reignith by so ffauerable lawes as is be ffore de|clared.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. HERE HE SHEWITH THE PERELLIS THAT MEY COME TO THE KYNG BY OUER MYGHTYE SUBGETTES.</HEAD>
<P>BUT sithyn the said extraordinarie charges bith so vncertayne &thorn;at thai be not estymable, hit is not 
<PB REF="00000152.tif" N="128"> possible to putt in certayne, what lyvelod will yerely suffice to beyre ham. Wherfore we nede in this case to vse coniecture and ymaginacion, as to thynk that &thorn;er is no lordis livelod in Englond sufficient to beyre the kynges extraordinare charges. Then nedith it &thorn;at the kynges livelod, aboff such reuenues as shalbe asseigned for his ordinare charges, be gretter than the livelod off the grettest lorde in Englande. And perauenture, whan livelod sufficient ffor the kynges ordinarie charges is lemitted and asseigned therto, hit shall apere, that diuerse lordis off Englande haue also moch livelode off thair owne, as than shall remayne in the kynges handes ffor his extraordinarie charges; wich were inconvenient, and wold be to the kynge right dredefull. For than such a lord mey dispende more then the kynge, con|sideringe &thorn;at he is charged with no such charges extraordinarie or ordinarie as is the kyng, except an houshold, wich is but litle in comparison off the kynges house. Wherfore yff it be thus, it shalbe necessarie, &thorn;at ther be purveyid ffor the kyng moch gretter livelod than he hath yet. For manis corage is so noble, &thorn;at naturally he aspirith to high thinges, and to be exaltid, and &thorn;erfore enforsith hym selff to be alway gretter and gretter. Ffor wych the philo|sopher saith, <B>omnia amamus sed principari maius.</B> Wherof it hath comyn &thorn;at oftyn tymes, when a subget hath hade also gret livelod as his prince, he hath anon aspired to &thorn;e estate of his prince, wich by such a man mey sone be gote. Ffor the remenante off the subgettes off such a prince, seyng &thorn;at yff so myghty a subget myght opteyne &thorn;e estate off thair prince, thai shulde than be vndir a prince double so myghty as was thair old prince;&mdash;wich encrease any subget 
<PB REF="00000153.tif" N="129"> desirith, ffor his owne discharge off &thorn;at he beyrith to the sustenance off his prince;&mdash;and therfore wolbe right gladde to help such a subgett in his rebillion. And also such an enterprise is the more ffeseable, when such a rebell hath more riches than his souer|ayne lorde. Ffor the peple will go with hym &thorn;at best mey susteyne and rewarde ham. This maner off doynge hath be so ofte practised nerehande in euery reaume, &thorn;at thair cronicles be full off it. In the reaume off Ffraunce was neuer chaunge off thair kynge, sithyn it was ffirst inabyted by Ffrench men, but by &thorn;e rebillion off such myghty subgettes; as Hyldericus kyng off Ffraunce, dissended off Clodone, wich was ffirst Cristen kyng off Ffraunce, was putt doune by Pepyne son to Carollus Marcellus, wich was the most myghty subget &thorn;at into that tyme was euer sene in &thorn;e reaume off Ffraunce. And aftirwarde Charles, discended off Carolus Magnus, sonne to the said Pepyne by ix. or by x. generacions, was put ffrom the kyngdome of Ffraunce by Hugh Capite, sonne to Hugo Magnus, Erle of Paris, wich tho was the myghtieste subgett off Ffraunce, and therfore create and callid <B>Dux Ffranci&aelig;.</B> And in owre dayis we haue sene a subgett off the Ffrench kynges in such myght, &thorn;at he hath gyven bataill to the same kyng, and putt hym to flight, and aftirwad be segett hym beyng in Paris is grettest cete, and soo keppid thair, vnto &thorn;e tyme his said kyng hade made such ende with hym, his adherentes, and fauctours, as he desired. We haue also sene late in owre reaume, somme off the kynges subgettes gyff hym bataill, by occasion &thorn;at thair livelod and offices were &thorn;e grettest off &thorn;e lande, and ellis thai wolde not haue done soo.</P>
<P>The Erlis of Lecestir and Glocestre, wich were &thorn;e 
<PB REF="00000154.tif" N="130"> grettest lordes off Englond, rose ayenest thair kynge Herre the iij<SUP>de</SUP>, and toke hym and his sonne prisoners in the ffelde. Wich maner off demeynynge the kyng off Scottis &thorn;at last dyed dredyng to be practysed in his lande, putt owt off the same lande &thorn;e Erle Douglas whos livelod and myght was nere hande equivalent to his owne, moved &thorn;erto be no other cause, saue only drede off his rebyllion. The crony|cles off euery reaume, and in especiall off Spayne and Denmarke, bith full off such ensamples; and so bith also the bokis off kynges in holy scripture; wherfore it nedith not to write mor herein. And also it mey not be eschewid, but &thorn;at the grete lordis off &thorn;e lande by reason off nev dissentes ffallyng vnto ham, by reason also off mariages, purchasses, and o&thorn;er titles, shall often tymes growe to be gretter than thai be now, and perauentur somme off hem to be off livelod and poiar like a kyng; wich shalbe right god ffor the lande while thai aspire to non hygher estate. Ffor such was &thorn;e Duke of Lancastre, &thorn;at warred &thorn;e kynge off Spayne, on off the myghtiest kynges off Cristendome, in his owne reaume. But this is writun only to the entent &thorn;at it be well vnder|stande, how necessarie it is &thorn;at the kynge haue grete possescions, and peculier livelod ffor his owne suirte; namely, whan any of his lordis shull happen to be so excessyuely grete, as ther mought therby groue perell to his estate. For certanly ther mey no grettir perell growe to a prince, than to haue a subgett equepolent to hym selff.

<P>Now that the lykennes off the kynges charges ordinarie and extraordinarie bith shewid, and ouer that, how necessarie it is that he haue grete livelod aboff &thorn;e same charges, in wich it nedyth &thorn;at he excede gretly euery man off the lande, wych livelod vndoutedly he hath not at &thorn;is day; hyt is therfore byhouefull &thorn;at we now serch how the kyng mey haue such livelod; but ffirst, off what comodites it mey best be take. The kyng off Ffraunce myght not sumtyme dyspende off his demaynes, as in lorde|shippes, and o&thorn;er patrimonie peculier, so mich as myght tho the kynge off England; wich mey well appere be that the qwene off Ffraunce hath but v. M<SUP>l</SUP> marke yerely to huyr douer, wher as the qwene off Englond hath x. M<SUP>l</SUP> marke. Ffor in tho dayis ther was but litle more off the reaume off Ffraunce in the kynges handes, but &thorn;at parte wich is callyd the Ile off Ffraunce. Ffor all the remenant off the reaume as Burgonye, Normandye, Guyne, Cham|payne, Langdoke, and Fflaunders, with mony o&thorn;er such grete lordshippes, were than in the handes off the Dussepers, and off o&thorn;er princes and grete lordis. Ffor wych cause the gabell off the salt, and the quaterimes of the wynes were graunted to the kynge by the iij estates off Ffraunce, wych was no litill subsidie. Ffor ther is no man in Ffraunce &thorn;at mey eyte salt, but yff he bie it off the kyng; and that is now sett to so grete prise, &thorn;at the bushell, wich the

<P>SOME men haue said &thorn;at it were good ffor the kyng, &thorn;at the commons off Englande were made pore, as be the commons off Ffraunce. Ffor than thai wolde not rebelle, as now thai done oftentymes; wich the commons off Ffraunce do not, nor mey doo; ffor thai haue no wepen, nor armour, nor good to bie it with all. To theis maner off men mey be said with the phylosopher, <B>ad pauca respicientes de facili enunciant</B>. This is to say, thai that see but ffew thynges, woll sone say thair advyses. Ffor soth theis ffolke consideren litill the good off the reaume off Englond, wheroff the myght stondith most vppon archers, wich be no ryche men.

What than wolde ffall, yff all the commons were pouere? Trewly it is lyke that this lande then shulde be like vnto &thorn;e reaume off Boeme, wher the commons ffor pouerte rose apon the nobles, and made all thair godis to be comune. <B>Item</B>, hit is the kyngis honour, and also is office, to make is reaume riche; and it is dishonour whan he hath but a pouere reaume, off wich men woll say &thorn;at he reigneth but vppon beggers. Yet it were moch gretter dishonour, yff he ffounde is reaume riche, and then made it pouere. And it were also gretly ayenest his conciens, &thorn;at awght to defende hem and her godis, yff he toke ffro hem thair godis with owt lafull cause; ffrom the infame wheroff God defende owre kyng, and gyff hym grase to augmente is reaume in riches, welth, and prosperite, to his per|petuell laude and worshippe. <B>Item</B>, the reaume off Ffraunce givith neuer ffrely off thair owne gode will any subsidie to thair prince, be cause &thorn;e commons &thorn;eroff be so pouere, as thai meynot give any thyng off &thorn;air owne godis.

But owre commons be riche, and &thorn;erfore thai give to thair kynge, at somme tymes quinsimes and dessimes, and ofte tymes o&thorn;er grete subsidies, as he hath nede ffor &thorn;e gode and defence off his reaume.

This myght thai not haue done, yff thai hade ben im|pouershed be thair kyng, as be the commons off Ffraunce; nor such a graunte hath be made by any reaume off cristendome, off wich any cronicle makith mencion; nor non o&thorn;er mey or hath cause to do so. Ffor thai haue not so much ffredome in thair owne godis, nor be entreted by so ffauerable lawes as we be, except a ffewe regions be ffore specified. <B>Item</B>, we se dayly, how men &thorn;at haue lost thair godis, and be ffallen into pouerte, be comme anon robbers and theves; wich wolde not haue ben soche, yff pouerte hade not brought hem &thorn;erto.

<P>POUERTE is not the cause, whi the commons off Ffraunce rise not ayen thair souerayn lorde. Ffor &thorn;er were neuer people in &thorn;at lande more pouere, then were in owre tyme the commons off the contre off Caux, wich was tho almost diserte ffor lakke off tillers; as it now well apperith be the new husbondry &thorn;at is done &thorn;er, namely in grobbyng and stokkyng off treis, busses, and groves, growen whill we were ther lordes off the contray. And yet the said commons off Caux made a mervelous gret rysinge, and toke owre townis, castelles, and ffortresses, and slowe owre capitans and soudiours, at soche a tyme as we hade but ffewe men off werre lyinge in &thorn;at contray. Wich provith &thorn;at it is not pouerte &thorn;at kepith Ffrenchmen ffro rysinge, but it is cowardisse and lakke off hartes and corage, wich no Ffrenchman hath like vnto a Englysh man.

<P>THE kyngis counsell was wonned to be chosen off grete princes, and off the gretteste lordes off &thorn;e lande, both spirituelles and temporellis, and also off o&thorn;er men that were in grete auctorite and offices. Wich lordes and officers had nere hande also mony maters off thair owne to be treded in the counsell, as hade &thorn;e kynge. Wherthrough, when thai come to gedre, thai were so occupied with thair owne maters, and with the maters off thair kynne, ser|uantes, and tenantes, &thorn;at thai entendet but litle, and o&thorn;er while no thynge, to &thorn;e kynges maters. And also &thorn;er were but ffewe maters off the kynges, but yff &thorn;e same maters toucheden also &thorn;e said coun|sellers, thair cosyns, &thorn;er seruantes, tenantes, or such o&thorn;er as thai owed ffauor vnto. And what lower man was &thorn;er sytinge in &thorn;at counsell, &thorn;at durste say ayen the openyon off any off the grete lordis? And whi myght not then men make be meanes off cor|rupcion somme off the seruantes and counsellers off somme off the lordes to moue the lordes to par|ciallite, and to make hem also ffauorable and parcial as were the same seruantes, or the parties &thorn;at so moved hem? Then couude no mater treted in the counsell be kept prive. Ffor the lordes oftentymes tolde ther owne counsellours and seruantes, that hade suyd to hem ffor tho maters, how thai had sped in ham, and who was ayen ham. How mey

Wich thynges considered, and also mony o&thorn;er wech shall be shewid hereaftir, hit is thought gode, that &thorn;e kynge had a counsell chosen and estableshed in the fourme that ffolowith, or in some o&thorn;er ffourme like &thorn;erto. Ffirst, &thorn;at ther were chosen xij spirituell men, and xij temporell men, off &thorn;e wysest and best disposed men &thorn;at can be ffounde in all the parties off this lande; and that thai be sworne to counsell the kynge aftir a ffourme to be devysed ffor &thorn;er owthe.

And &thorn;at thes xxiiij. be alway counsellers, but yff &thorn;er be any defaute ffounde in hem, or &thorn;at hit lyst the kynge, be the advise off &thorn;e more parte off hem, chaunge any off hem.

It shall not be necessarie, &thorn;at the xij spirituell men off this covnsell, haue so gret wages as the xij temporall men; be cause thai shull not nede to kepe an houshold in thair contray, while thai ben absent, as the temporell men moste nedes

By wich con|sideracion the spirituell juges in the courte off par|liment off Parys, taken but cc. ffrankes by &thorn;e yere, where as &thorn;e temporell juges &thorn;eroff taken by the yere ccc. ffrankes.

<P>THE Romaynes, while thair counsell callid &thorn;e senate was gret, gate, through &thorn;e wysdome off that counsell, the lordshippe off gret partye of the world. And aftirward Julyus, thair ffirst emperowre, coun|selled by &thorn;e same senate, gate the monarchie ner|hande off all &thorn;e world. Wherthrough Octavian, &thorn;er secounde emperour, commounded all &thorn;e world to be discribed as subget vnto hym. But aftir this, when yll dysposed emperours, as Nero, Domician, and o&thorn;er had slayn grete parte off &thorn;e senatours, and dyspiced the counsell off &thorn;e senate, the estate off &thorn;e Romans and off &thorn;er emperours be ganne to fall doune, and hath ffallen alwey sythyn, in to suche decay, &thorn;at nowe the lordeshippes off &thorn;e emperour bith not so gret, as be &thorn;e lordeshippes off some kynge, wich, while &thorn;e senate was hole, was subget to &thorn;e emperour. Be wich ensample it is thought, &thorn;at yff the kyng haue such a Counsell as is beffore specified, his lande shall not only be ryche and welthy, as were

<P>YFF it woll lyke &thorn;e kyng to gyff non office, in to the tyme &thorn;at his entente therin be comened with his counsell, and thair opiniyon by his hyghnes vnder|stonde in the same, he shall mowe so rewarde his seruantes with offices, as ther shall be lityll nede to gyff hem moch off his livelod, and his offices shall then be geuen to soche as shall only serue hym selff. Wher through he shall haue than a greter myght, and a garde off his officers, when he liste to call thaym, than he hath nowe off his o&thorn;er ffeed men vndre the astate off lordes. Ffor the myght off &thorn;e lande, aftir the myght off &thorn;e grete lordes &thorn;eroff, 
<PB REF="00000175.tif" N="151"> stondith most in &thorn;e kynges officers. Ffor thai mowe best rule &thorn;e contreis wher as &thorn;er offices ben, wich is in euery partie off &thorn;e lande. A pouere baylyff mey do more in his bayille, then any man off his degre dwellynge with in his office. Some fforester off &thorn;e kynges, that hath non o&thorn;er livelod, mey brynge moo men to &thorn;e ffelde well areyed, and namely ffor sho|tynge, then mey some knyght or Squyer off ryght gret lyuelod, dwellynge be hym, and hauynge non offyce. What than mey gretter officers do, stewardes off gret lordeshippes, reseyvors, constables off Castels, maystir fforesters, and such o&thorn;er officers; be sydis the hygher offycers, as Justices off fforestes, Justices and Chambirlayns off Contreis, &thorn;e warden off &thorn;e portes, and such o&thorn;er? Ffor sothe it is not lyghtly estymable, what myght &thorn;e kynge may haue off is officers, yff euery off hem hade but on office, and serued non o&thorn;er man but &thorn;e kynge. Nor hit is ease to be estemed, howe mony men mey be rewarded with offices, and how gretly, yff thai be discretly geuen. The kynge givyth mo than M<SUP>ll</SUP> offices, be sydes tho &thorn;at my lorde &thorn;e prince geuyth, off wich I reken &thorn;e officers, as the kynges officers. Off thes officers some mey dispende by &thorn;e yere, by reason off is office, cc. li., some a c.li., some a c. marc, some xl. li., some l. marc, and so downwarde.

How mony men then off euery estate, and off euery degre, and how gretly, 
<PB REF="00000176.tif" N="152"> mey the kynge rewarde with offices, with owt gyuynge awey off his livelod. Ffor soth the grettest lordes livelod in Englande mey not suffice to rewarde so many men, though he wolde departe hit euery dell amonges is seruantes; nor ij. the gretteste lordes off Englond mey make so gret a myghte as &thorn;e kynge mey haue only off his officers, yff thai were holliche and only is seruantes, and euery off hem had but on office. To this sane suche lordes and o&thorn;er men, such as axen off &thorn;e kyng offices ffor thair seruantes, that thai and all thair seruantes shall alwey serue &thorn;e kynge, and is officers shul do hym the bettir seruyce, by reason thei bith in &thorn;er seruice; ffor thai woll helpen hym to do so, and suffre non in thair companye, but suche as woll do so. Wher to may be said, that it is trewe thai shall do the kyng seruice while thai be in thair companie; but so shulde thai haue done, though the kynge had neuer made thaym his officers. Wher fore &thorn;e kynge shal not be the bettir served, &thorn;at he hath yeuen his offices to thair seruantes, but ra&thorn;er worse. Ffor owre lorde said, <B>Remo potest duobus dominis seruire</B>. And so &thorn;e kynge shall lese the offices, as ffor any syngular service he shall haue ffor hem, or &thorn;at the same officers shulde thynke them selff by hold vnto the kynge ffor &thorn;er offices, wich is hyghnes hath yeuen them at &thorn;e contemplacion off &thorn;er maisters, and ffor no reward off any seruice &thorn;at thai haue done, or shul doo vnto hym selff. Be consideracion wher off &thorn;er olde maistirs shall be bettir serued be thaym than thei were be fore; and so be more myghty in thair contraes to do what them liste; and the kynge in lasse myght, and haue the ffewer officers to represse hem when thai do a mysse.
