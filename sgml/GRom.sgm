<P><TITLE>Early English versions of the Gesta Romanorum</TITLE> was keyboarded by Seconr, 5% proofed, and found to be within 1 error in 20,000 characters specifications.  It was encoded by Kenneth Church and mark-up was revied by Catherine Paul.</P><P>The Herrtage edition has been rearranged slightly. When a second
version of a story exists, the print edition splits the page in two,
with the primary verion appearing on consecutive tops of pages and the
second version appearing on bottoms. These stories have been brought
together at the DIV1 level, with each version contained in a DIV2.
There is a BIBL tag at the beginning of each DIV2 showing its manuscript source, and milestones reveal the manuscript pagination.</P><P>The front matter of the Herrtage edition--the title page, contents, introduction, comparative table of manuscripts, and additional notes (pp. v-[xxxiii])--have been omitted, and this electronic text begins on page one, with the opening of the Wynken de Worde edition.</P>
<P>In the Wynkyn de Worde edition presented herein (the last eight
stories), the moral of the story is not distinguished by a heading and
is sometimes included in the preceding paragraph. When the typography
of the chapter does not make it clear where the two parts meet, the
DIV2 and/or P have been split according to the
context, and a head supplied to indicate the beginning of the moral.</P>
<P>In four instances, folio markings were listed as numbered footnotes
but their corresponding number did not appear in the text itself.
This happened with text pages 225, 240, 244, and 273; these are leaf
188 col. 2, leaf 192 col. 1, leaf 191 back col 1, and leaf 198 col. 1,
respectively.  We do not have an alternative edition of this
manuscript to which to refer for placement of the milestone tags.  Milestone tags have been inserted for these leafs where it was estimated that they
would have been.</P>
<P>The 'sic' and 'corr' tags used in this document refer to the
changes made by the original editor, Sidney Herrtage.</P>
<P>The Addit.
9066 is quite similar to Cambr. MS Kk. 1. 6. The differences between
the manuscripts are provided in footnotes in the edition from which
this electronic text is taken, with the Addit. as the primary text and
Cambr.'s differences in the notes. In the electronic edition,
footnotes have been replaced by &lt;note type=variant&gt; followed by
the difference or "omitted." The * character is used as a left
boundary to the text of Addit. 9066 that is affected by the note and the
note appears at the right boundary. If no * is present before the
note, the replacement or omission is interpreted to indicate the
single word that the note follows.</P><P>Beginning on page 429 of Herrtage's edition is a series of addtional stories not given in any of the manuscripts, but present in Wynkyn de Worde's Edition (c. 1510). These have been separated from the stories presents in the manuscripts by being enclosed by a separate DIV1.</P>

ba&thorn;, &thorn;e clerk toke him a myrour in his hond, and seide,
"Nowe &thorn;ou shalt see in this myrour a&llbar; that I spake of to
&thorn;e."  And thenne seide he, "ye, sot&hbar;ly I see a&llbar;
opynly in myne hous, &thorn;at &thorn;ou spakist of to me.  And now
&thorn;e myster-man takit&hbar; his bowe, and wo&llbar; schete att

smyten &thorn;e ymage, &thorn;ou sholdist have I-be de&dtail;.  But
loke nowe on the myrour, and te&llbar; me what &thorn;ou seist."  "Now

"Do thenne," quo&thorn; the Clerke, as &thorn;ou dyd afore, or ellis
&thorn;ou shalt be ded."  And &thorn;erfore the kny&yogh;t putte
a&llbar; his hede vndir &thorn;e water.  And whenne he had so y-done,
he raisi&dtail; hit vp a&yogh;en, And seyde to &thorn;e clerke, "He
makit&hbar; sorowe nowe more &thorn;an ony man wo&llbar; trowe, For he
smot not &thorn;e ymage; And he Cryed to my wif, seiyn&gtee;,
&thorn;at if I fayle the thir&dtail; tyme, I am but ded my selfe, And
&thorn;yne husbond sha&llbar; lyve; And my wif maki&thorn;

he, "he hat&hbar; bend his bowe, and goit&hbar; ny to &thorn;e ymage
for to shete; and &thorn;erfor I drede now gretly."  "Do
&thorn;erfore," seide the clerke, "do as I bade doo afore, and dred
&thorn;e no&thorn;yn&gtee;."  So &thorn;e kny&yogh;t, whenne he sawe
the scheter drawe his bowe, he swapte his hed vndir &thorn;e watir, as
he dyd afore; And thenne he toke it vp a&yogh;en, And lokid yn
&thorn;e myrour, and he low&yogh; with a gret myrt&hbar;.  "I sey,"
quod the clerke, "whi law&yogh;ist &thorn;ou soo?" "For the archer
wold have y-schot at the ymage, And he hat&hbar; y-schotte him selfe

"Sire," quo&thorn; &thorn;e kinge, "we redyn further; by a casuel

themperoure, "Calle to me my seconde sone." anone his eldest sone,
gretely gladded of his faders gyfte, called in his broder / and whan

"My reuerent fader, I thanke you moche."  Than sayd themperoure.
"calle to me my thyrde sone" / and so it was done.  And whan he was

And the eldest sone anone toke season of the tree.  Whan the seconde

the lordes and 
<pb N="437"  ID="pb.685" > 
states of his empyre, and made a greate feest at theyr weddynge. And
thenne, after the feest, Socrates led home his wyfe to his owne house,
where as they lyued in pease and helth longe tyme / but at last this
Emperours doughter sekened to deth.  Whan Socrates this perceyued, he
sayd to hym selfe, "Alas &amp; wo to me, what shall I do, &amp;
whether shall I flee, yf themperours doughter, yt is my wyfe, sholde
deye?"  &amp; for sorowe this Socrates wente to a forest there besyde,
&amp; wepte bytterly.  The whyle he wepte thus &amp; mourned, there
came an aged man berynge a staffe in his honde, &amp; asked the cause
of Socrates, why he mourned?  Socrates answered, and sayd, "I wedded
themperours doughter vpon this condycyon, yt yf she deyed in my
felawshyp, I sholde lese my lyfe / and now she is sekened vnto the
deth, &amp; I can fynde no remedy of helpe, &amp; therfore I mourne
more than ony creature can thynke."  Than sayd the olde man, "Be ye
conforted, for I shall be your helper, yf ye wyl do after my
counceyll.  In this forest be thre herbes; yf ye make a drynke of the
fyrst to your wyfe, &amp; of ye other .ij. a playster, and yf she vse
this medycyne drynke and plaster, in due tyme without doubte she shall
recouer to perfyte helth."  Socrates fulfylled all as the olde man had
taught hym.  And whan his wyfe had vsed a whyle that medycynall drynke
&amp; plaster, within shorte tyme she was perfytly hole of all her
sekenes.  And whan themperour herde yt Socrates wrought so wysely /
