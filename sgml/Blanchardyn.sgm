<P><TITLE>Caxton's Blanchardyn and Eglantine</TITLE> was keyboarded by Chrisian, 5% proofed and found to be within 1 error in 20,000 characters specifications.  All material, except for the back matter, including the Name Index and Glossary, is included and is represented in the electronic edition as it was in the print edition (so far as is possible). The text was encoded by Kenneth Church, proofread by Kenneth Church (5%), and the markup reviewed by Catherine Paul.</P><P>All "corr" tags correspond to corrections that the editor, Leon Kellner, made from the original.  The "sic" attribute contains the word or phrase as it appeared in the manuscript.</P><P>Kellner has created three basic types of notes that are tagged in different ways.  First, where text has been added by the scribe and noted by Kellner by the phrase "Wanting in the French," or "Wanting," the text has been surrounded by "add" tags and Kellner's note retained as a pointer or note inside the "add" tags.  Second, where Kellner has supplied the original French for a phrase in the English text, the note contains both the French and the English parallel.  Finally, on occasion Kellner notes where the English text omits the French original.  These instances are marked as notes as they occur in the text.</P><P>Milestone markers are inserted as they occur in the English editions, although some are missing.  Milestone markers that appear in brackets at the beginning of the two parallel versions of the English text have been inserted into this electronic edition to help orient the reader and do not occur in Kellner's edition.</P><P>At the beginning of the text, two versions of the first six chapters and part of the seventh chapter run parallel to one another -- the first from Caxton's 1489 edition, and the second from the 1595 translation by Thomas Pope Goodwine.  Therefore, we have maintained the parallel structure by running each chapter of the 1595 edition after its counterpart from the Caxton edition (ca. 1489) . The chapter title for both versions is supplied from an abbreviated title from the Caxton chapters.  Each version retains its original chapter title.   Similarly, a parallel structure has been maintained at the end of the text for the final chapter, which consists of the English version of Caxton, continued by the 1595 edition of T.P. Goodwine, running parallel to a French version taken from the Paris MS. Bibl. Nat. 24,371 of the French original. </P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE

TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.8" ><HEAD> &sect;1. RELATIONS between the Noun and the other parts of speech.</HEAD>
<P>From the logician's point of view, every 'part of speech' has a
province of its own, strictly limited and separated from the other
'parts'; but in practice, language constantly cuts the line drawn by
Aristotle, and some English students are wont to say that nearly
every short English noun and verb can be used as verb, noun, and
adjective, while nearly every adjective can be used as a noun: 'a
plant, plant-life or plant-culture, to plant; tea, tea-district, we'll tea
you at our tent; love, love trifles, to love; his english, English ways,
to english; the true, the beautiful; true that line,' &amp;c.;</P>
<P>In Old English there are several instances in which both noun
and adjective are denoted by the same form of a word, as earfo&eth;
(difficulty and difficult), leoht (light sb., bright adj.), weor&eth; (worth,
sb. and adj.), yrre (wrath, sb. and adj.); every adjective may be used
substantively, in the singular as well as in the plural, in the positive
as well as in the comparative and superlative degree; the infinitive
and the verbal noun (in -ung, -ing) may be said to belong to the
noun as well as to the verb.  Theoretically, the tendency of every
literary language of the present day is to observe the laws of logic in
grammar and style, and to restrict as far as possible the use of every
part of speech to its own dominion, though practically, as stated
above, speakers and writers claim and exercise full freedom in this
respect.  Caxton and his contemporaries did not care to be fettered
by niceties of logic, and thus we have to state the following relations,
in his books, between the noun and the other parts of speech.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="sub-theme"  ID="DIV5.9" ><HEAD>1. Nouns used as adjectives.</HEAD>
<P>We have kept in Modern English a few such expressions as
'queen-mother, queen-dowager, lord-lieutenant,'<note ID="note.2" >At the Philological Society's Meeting on Nov. 1., when parts of this Introduction were read as a Paper, the Members divided these 3 sample-words into
two classes, I. two nouns, 'queen-mother'; II. noun and adjective, 'queen-dowager,'
'lord-lieutenant.'</NOTE> where 'queen,' 'lord'



<pb N="vi"  ID="pb.7" >
are to be looked on more as appositions than as the first part of
compounds; and there are others, like 'fellow-creature, deputy-marshal,
champion-sculler,' where 'fellow,' 'deputy,' 'champion' are
used quite adjectively.  But while in Modern English this use is
restricted in common speech to a few cases,&mdash;I exclude the conscious
archaisms in poetry and historic romances,&mdash;Caxton is very free in
forming such appositive compositions:&mdash;</P>

for a time, though it is afterwards revived in literary, if not in
common, speech.  Berners, in his <HI REND="i">Huon of Burdeux</HI>, has still 'a
felon traitour,' I. 5/4; 'thou &slong;alse traitour knyght,' I. 41/26.  But
the edition of 1601 alters the latter passage into 'trayterous knyght.'
'Traitor knight' and like expressions will, however, be found in
plenty of later poems and romances, though more or less consciously
as archaisms.</P></DIV5><DIV5 TYPE="sub-theme"  ID="DIV5.10" ><HEAD>2. Adjectives used substantively.</HEAD>
<P>Compared with its power in Old English, and even in the first
two centuries of the Middle-English period, the adjective of the
present day has lost a good deal of its vigour and independence.
By inflexion, any adjective could formerly express alone what it can
now say only by adding a noun: e. g. se g&oacute;da (the good man), &thorn;&oelig;t


<pb N="vii"  ID="pb.8" >
g&oacute;d (the good, in opposition to evil), &thorn;&aacute; g&oacute;dan (the good ones, the
righteous).  We can still use: 'the good and evil of this life, of
adversity,' &amp;c.; 'the good (pl.) shall be happy, the evil (pl.) miserable,
hereafter.'  But in consequence of the inflexion having decayed, the
independence of the adjective was to some extent given up, in order
to avoid ambiguity.  In Modern English prose we only retain&mdash;and
in the plural only, as to persons&mdash;those which exclude all ambiguity,
e. g. 'the poor and the rich,' always plural now, Psalms and Bible
used singular, or whose ambiguity the context removes.  Caxton's
use of the adjectives is, in this respect, nearly modern.</P>
<P>The adjectives used substantively may be divided into the
following groups:&mdash;</P><LIST><ITEM>(a) Adjectives qualifying concrete nouns, mostly persons.<LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL><HI
REND="i">Specyall</HI></LABEL> = friend, <HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 84/34; elsewhere, frende specyall, 72/10,

<DIV3 TYPE="subsection"  ID="DIV3.15" ><HEAD>CASES.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.16" ><HEAD>&sect; 4. The Nominative Case.</HEAD>
<P>The Nominative in Middle English ranges over a wider area than
in Old English.  First, its dominion is enlarged in consequence of
the other cases losing their characteristic inflexions, and being mistaken
for the nominative; secondly, it is used in syntactic connections
and expressions which were unknown to the older periods of
the English language.</P>
<P>In the struggle between the nominative and the accusative (or
dative?) case of the personal pronoun (ye and you), as late as the end
of the 15th century, the nominative is far from being overcome.</P>
<P>1. The first function of the nominative is to express the subject
of a sentence.  So far as the logical subject is concerned, there has
been no change from Old English down to Modern English times.</P>
<P>2. But in the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, the grammatical
subject became much more frequent and important than ever
it was before.</P>
<P>(a) While Old English is very rich in impersonal verbs, there is a
tendency in the later periods of Middle English towards the personal
expression, that is to say (as Koch puts it), what once appeared as a
<pb N="xii"  ID="pb.13" >
dim sensation is made to appear as the conscious action of the free
mind.  Instead of 'hit hre&oacute;&utail;e&eth;, hit sceame&eth;, hit lica&eth;, hit langa&eth;,'
there appear 'I repent, I am ashamed, I like, I long.'  This natural
development was favoured by two external causes.  In such instances
as 'Wo was this kyng,' <HI REND="i">Chaucer</HI>, II. 193, what is an indirect object
was mistaken for the nominative case; and secondly, the French
model had great influence.  See Chapter VI. on the Impersonal Verbs,
p. xlvii, below.</P>
<P>(b) The second encroachment of the nominative on the dative case
took place in the passive constructions of transitive verbs governing
a direct and an indirect object, or of intransitive verbs followed by
prepositions.  This innovation was brought about first by the dative
and accusative cases being confounded.  Objects governed by verbs
like 'command, answer,' etc., were consequently looked upon as
accusative cases, and were treated as such, so that they became
capable of the passive construction.</P>
<P>In Caxton's time, however, that process was not yet completed;
hence such expressions as the following, which we still keep: 'as
was tolde him by the knyght,' <HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 43/1; 'all that was told him,'
196/20.  See the chapter on the Passive, p. lxi, below.</P>
<P>3. The Nominative absolute wholly supplanted the Old English
dative, and became much more popular than the Old English construction
(apparently from Latin) had ever been.  This use, which is
quite common in the 14th century (for Chaucer, cf. <HI REND="i">Einenkel</HI>, p. 74,
ff.), occurs rather frequently in the time of Caxton, and offers nothing
of special interest:&mdash;</P>
<P>'This ansuere y-herde, Alymodes ... made his oost to approche,'
<HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 57/28; 'and that doon, ... he shall mowe,' etc., 73/24;&mdash;preceded
by after, 94/6; <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 44/21, 47/31, 58/31,
61/12, 62/17, and <HI REND="i">passim</HI>; <HI REND="i">Huon</HI>, 3/29, 39/5.</P>
<P>4. Another function of the nominative case was that in connection
with the infinitive:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI REND="i">e. g.</HI> 'I say this, be ye redy with good herte To al my lust, and
that I frely may As me best liste do you laughe or smerte, And neuer
ye to gruch it night ne day.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Chaucer</HI>, II. 289.  See the chapter on
the Infinitive, p. lxiv, below.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="sub-theme"  ID="DIV5.17" ><HEAD>5. Interchange of the Nominative and the Accusative cases.

</HEAD>
<pb N="xiii"  ID="pb.14" ><P>(a) Though the use of you instead of ye occurs as early as the
middle of the 14th century ('yhow knaw,' Hampole, <HI REND="i">Pricke of
Conscience</HI>, p. 127, l. 4659; cf. <HI REND="i">Book of Curtesye</HI>, Introduction,
p. x), the nominative holds its place on to the time of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>Caxton, as a rule, has preserved ye; it is only in the inverted
position (imperative, less frequent in interrogative sentences) that you
is introduced; but the number of ye's, even in that position, prevails.</P>
<P>In <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> there are two you's in the imperative:&mdash;</P>
<P>'Come you with me,' 60/28; 'be you sure,' 185/17.  (The
instances are, of course, much more numerous in<HI REND="i"> The Foure Sonnes
of Aymon</HI> and <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>.)</P>
<P><HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>.  'But knowe you, that Hernyer dyde mysse of his enterpryse,'
90/15; 'Fayr chyldren, now be you sure,' 129/1; 'defye you

'telle me, how thynke you?'  170/1; 'what thynge aske you of

<P><HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 206/6, 240/22, 242/14, 251/29, 255/16, 255/33,
269/8, 279/18, etc., etc.</P>
<P><HI REND="i">Huon</HI>, 33/9, 33/19, 41/5, 79/32, 98/10, 102/5, 110/13, etc.</P>
<P>There are, however, several instances of you in another position:</P>
<P>'You holde,' <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 26/18; 'Cosin, sayd Reynawde, you speke
well and wysely,' <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 132/33; 'now up, Ogyer, and you, duke
Naymes,' <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 157/23; 'yf you wyl yelde your selfe to his merci,'
189/22, 432/14, 438/10.</P>
<P>(b) There is another instance in which the nominative case has
been encroached upon by the dative.  That well-known tendency of
using absolute personal pronouns in the dative case, which has divided
the French pronouns into two different classes (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">conjoints</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="fre">absolus</FOREIGN>),
and which appears in such modern English phrases as 'it is me,
older than me,' is not wholly unknown to Caxton.  He always
has 'it is I'<note ID="note.10" >Chaucer 'it am I.'</NOTE> (never me!), but in the following passages, p. xiv, there
is apparently a faint germ of that use.</P>
<P>In <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> the dative occurs twice where we expect the
nominative case; but there seems to be a sort of mixed construction:
'And syn aftre, he lyghtly dyde sette hande on the swerde, of the


<pb N="xiv"  ID="pb.15" >
whiche he smote here and there with bothe his handes by suche a
strengthe, that him that he rought with full stroke was all in to
brused,' 63/2,&mdash;him that = whom that, for 'he whom,' as if the
use of the flexionless that threw the case on to he; 'and sware that
he sholde neuer departe from afore the place unto the tyme that the
castel were take, and theym of within at his wyll,' 181/31,&mdash;'them'
for 'they.'</P>
<P>But the passages from <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI> do not admit of such an explanation:&mdash;</P>
<P>'whan thise wordes were fynysshed, all the foure brethren, and
all theym of theyr companye arayed themselfe ...' 78/22; 'the
base courte began to be sore moved, and the crye was so great, for al
them of the dongeon defended themselfe valyantlye,' 94/12; 'But I
telle you, upon your feythe that none other shal knowe the same,
but only we, us three, unto the tyme that the dede be accomplysshed,'
212/30.  Cf. <HI REND="i">The Curial</HI>, 4/18: 'For ther is nothyng more suspecte
to euyl peple than them whom they knowe to be wyse and trewe.'</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are striking instances of the nominative
being used instead of the dative or accusative case:&mdash;</P>
<P>'But at thentree of a forest that was there, they loste their
trayne, and went oute of ther waye, wherby they myght not folowe
nor ouertake the pucell, nor they that brought her with theym.'&mdash;<HI
REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
181/22; 'Go ayen to Tormaday to see the noble lande
of that lady, she of whom thou art amorouse so moche,' 186/19.</P>
<P>On this point I cannot refrain from quoting those passages of a
16th century play which contain the same use, as I have never come
across any parallel earlier or later.  Both in the last passage of
Caxton's and in those of <HI REND="i">Sir Clyoman and Sir Clamydes</HI> (falsely

<P>Finally, it is worth stating that but and sauf (save) don't govern
the accusative as prepositions, but are followed by the nominative, as
if they were conjunctions.  'Noon but I have seen it.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,

<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.18" ><HEAD>&sect; 5. The Genitive Case.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The genitive in connection with nouns (and pronouns).</P>
<P>The applicability of this genitive, which was nearly unlimited in
Old English, especially in poetry, is rather restricted in Caxton's
time.</P>
<P>1. The first function of this case, viz., that denoting birth and
relationship (whence the name genetivus), shares its dominion with
the dative:&mdash;</P>
<P>'My lady Margarete . . Moder unto our naturel & souerayn
lorde.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 1/3.  'Blanchardyn, sone unto the kynge of
Fryse.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 1/27.  'Blanchardyn ansuered that he was of the lande
of Grece, and sone to a kynge,' 100/1; 'and sayde to the kynge,
fader unto Blanchardyn,' 174/18; 'daughter to Kyng Alymodes,' 83/9;
'quene Morgause of Orkeney, moder to Sire Gawayne.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Morte
Darthur</HI>, 357/25; 'kynge Lots wyf and moder of sir Gawayne and
to sire Gaheris,' <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 425/12.</P>
<P>2. The objective genitive is not very frequent:&mdash;

</P>
<pb N="xvi"  ID="pb.17" ><P>'She bereth in her herte care ynough and dyspleysure for the
loue of him.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 73/33, 76/5, 77/25; 'for right moche
he desyred to shewe hymself, for his ladyes loue,' 83/8.</P>
<P>3. The genitive denoting quality is used in the same way as
in Modern English; only it is noteworthy that Malory treats it quite
as if it were an adjective, so as to use it in the comparative and superlative
degree.  'She is the fairest lady and most of beautie in the
world,' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 357/23; more of beautie, 358/13, 358/18,
360/33, 450/13, and frequently.  Instead of of, a sometimes
appears:&mdash;</P>
<P>'yf he had been yet man alyue, I wolde haue gyuen you tyl his
wyff.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 93/22.  alyue = of life; cf. liues = alife.&mdash;<HI
REND="i">Rob.
of Gloucester</HI>, 301/376; <HI REND="i">Owl and Nightingale</HI>, 1632; Morris,
note to l. 250 of <HI REND="i">Story of Genesis and Exodus</HI>.  'I am not a power
to reward the after thy merite.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 109/9.</P>
<P>4. The genitive of the personal pronoun instead of the possessive
pronoun occurs very frequently:&mdash;</P>
<P>(I) 'knewe wel that the story of hit was honeste.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
1/11.  'the sowle of the (thee),' 17/21; 'for pryde of her,' 39/14;
'the herte of hym,' 39/33, 64/17, 86/20, 87/31, 92/7, 106/17, 114/32,
etc.</P>
<P>This use is especially worth noting, when it occurs in sentences
like the following:&mdash;</P>
<P>'ye haue exposed the body of you and of your men,' 171/20.  In
Modern English we should say: 'your body and those of your men.'
Malory once says: 'I pray you hertely to be my good frende and to
my sones,' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 406/28.</P>
<P>5. The partitive genitive was not a great favourite with the
English of the 14th and 15th centuries.  After comparing the use
of this case in that time with what it was in Old English, we
cannot but conclude that the idea of partition attached to such
phrases as M&Aacute;&ETH;MA FELA (many treasures), <HI REND="i">Be&oacute;wulf</HI> 36, in Old
English was about to be supplanted by that of the simple apposition.
Apart from the fact that the numerals, as well as many
indefinite adverbs and pronouns, no longer governed the genitive,
compare the following expressions:&mdash;</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL><HI

<P>But there was a sudden stop in the development towards apposition
instead of the genitive; and at the end of the 15th century there
was a sort of reaction in favour of the Old English use.  Expressions
like those quoted above are not to be met with in Caxton;
only a few traces of the Middle English tendency remained.</P>
<P>Maner without of occurs in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> three times: 'by al
manere wayes,' 50/19; 'all manere noureture,' 74/8; 'al manere

viz., 28/20, 53/17, 55/27, 58/19, 60/31, 73/34, 93/32, 111/28, 117/27,
119/2, 119/11, 159/34, 174/12, 177/4, 186/8, 188/26, 197/28,
200/18.</P>
<P>Other is used for 'others of.'  'Other her gentyll women,' 76/31;
'other his prysoners,' 121/25.</P>
<P>Also any occurs for 'any of':&mdash;</P>
<P>'Affermyng that I oughte rather tenprynte his actes and noble
feates than of Godefroy of boloyne or ony the eight.'&mdash;Caxton's
Preface to <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 2/1.</P>
<P>In <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI> is a curious remnant of what must have been rather
common in the 14th century, as Chaucer offers several instances of it.
The passage runs as follows: 'but of all Fraunce I am one of the best
&amp; truest knyght that be in it,' 272/23.  These are the parallels in
Chaucer:&mdash;</P>
<P>'Oon of the grettest auctour that men rede' (5 MSS., one has
'auctours'), III. 234; 'On of the best farynge man on lyue,' III. 8;
'On of the best enteched creature,' V. 35 (cf. <HI REND="i">Einenkel</HI>, p. 87).</P>
<P>This odd expression is made up of two constructions: I. 'One the
best knyght.'  II. 'One of the best knyghtes.'  The former, which
was at last supplanted by the second, crops up many times in Middle
English, and has its parallel in other numerals:&mdash;</P>

<P>Apart from this liberty, we have to state a few other noteworthy
points respecting Caxton's use of the partitive genitive.</P>
<P>(a) There are numerous instances of the independent, or, as it is
sometimes called, the elliptic genitive partitive, which is so often
met with in Chaucer; cf. 'Of smale houndes hadde sche, that she
fedde,' II. 5.  Before Chaucer the instances are rare.  Perhaps the
following passages may be looked upon as approaching that use:&mdash;</P>
<P>'hwa se euer wule habbe lot wi&eth; &thorn;e of &thorn;i blisse: he mot dea'e
wi&eth; &thorn;e of &thorn;ine pine on eor&thorn;e.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">O. E. Hom</HI>. I. 187.  'man egge&eth; his
negebure to done o&eth;er to speken him harm, o&eth;er s(c)ame, and haue&eth;
ui&eth; elch wi&eth; o&eth;er, and make&eth; him to forlese his aihte, o&eth;er of his
rihte.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">O. E. Hom</HI>. II. 13.  '&thorn;e priue &thorn;yeues bye&thorn; &thorn;o &thorn;et ue stele&eth;
na&yogh;t of oncou&thorn;e ac of priue&thorn;.  And of zuichen &thorn;er bye&eth; of greate
and of smale.  &thorn;e greate bye&eth; of &thorn;e kneade and &thorn;e ontrewe reuen.'.
.&mdash;<HI REND="i">Ayenbite</HI>,
37.</P>
<P>Caxton has several instances of this use:&mdash;</P>
<P>'(She) tolde hym that she was right wel content of his seruyce,
and wolde reteyne hym in wages, and gyue hym of her goodes, for he
was worthy therof.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 75/5.  'wherof the kynge was
right wele content, and reseyued hym of his hous.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 99/21; =
as one of his house, or court.  (Cf. <HI REND="i">Huon</HI>, I. 13/20: 'the two sonnes
<pb N="xix"  ID="pb.20" >
of Duke Senyn of burdeux shal come to the courte, and, as I haue
harde say, the kynge hath sayde that, at there comynge, they shal be
made of hys pryuey counsell.')  'And wyte, that Guynon hadde wyth
hym of the beste knyghtes of Charlemagne.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 91/18.  'and
therefore lete us set upon hym or day, and we shalle slee doune of
his knyghtes:  ther shal none escape.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 121/10.
'(He) charged hym that he shold gyue hym of al maner of metes.'&mdash;<HI
REND="i">ibid</HI>.
214/20.  (Cf. <HI REND="i">Gesta Romanorum</HI>, 197: '&thorn;e knyghte of baldak
sent to the knite of lumbardye of al maner thinges.')</P>
<P>This use too was continued in the time of Henry VIII.:&mdash;</P>
<P>'I wyll ye take of your best frendys.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Huon</HI>, 5/25.  'this that
I haue shewid you is of truth.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 61/26.  'I requyre you, shewe
me of your newes and adventures that ye haue had.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 566/12.
'Englysh marchauntes do fetch of the erth of Irlonde to caste in
their gardens.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Andrew Borde</HI>, p. 133; cf. p. 170.</P>
<P>From an alteration of the 1601 edition of <HI REND="i">Huon</HI> we may perhaps
conclude that the English of that time did not relish this use in
prose.  The original edition has: 'for incontinent they wyll sende
of theyr shyppes, and take thys shyp,' 212/29; the edition of 1601
alters of into 'some of.'</P>
<P>(b) Here and there indefinite pronouns like 'much, many
(other)' are followed by of + noun: 'for he hath doon to us this
day so moche of euyl.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 169/22.  'wherof soo many of
children (were) faderles, and soo many churches wasted.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>,
27/19.  'a grete many of prysoners.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 87/4.  But, as a rule,
the modern use prevails.</P>
<P>(c) There is another sort of Genitive, which we may, perhaps, not
improperly term pseudo-partitive, viz. that which appears in sentences
like 'a castle of hers, a knight of Arthur's.'  It is true, that in many
cases we might translate these phrases by 'one of her castles, one of
Arthur's knights'; but there are many examples in Middle English
which do not admit of such an explanation, and the Modern English
use ('that beautiful face of hers!') proves that no idea of partition
is included in such expressions.  After a close examination of the
oldest instances as met with in the 14th century (second half?), we
see that they are brought into existence by another necessity.</P>
<P>In Old English the possessive pronoun, or, as the French say,
'pronominal adjective,' expresses only the conception of belonging
<pb N="xx"  ID="pb.21" >
and possession; it is a real adjective, and does not convey, as at
present, the idea of determination.  If, therefore, Old English
authors want to make such nouns determinative, they add the
definite article:</P>
<P>h&aelig;le&eth; m&iacute;n se leofa, <HI REND="i">Elene</HI>, 511; &thorn;&uacute; eart d&oacute;htor m&iacute;n s&eacute;o d&yacute;reste,
<HI REND="i">Juliana</HI>, 166; &thorn;&aelig;t tacnede Leoni&eth;a on his &thorn;&aelig;m nihstan gefeohte and
Persa, <HI REND="i">Orosius</HI>, 84/31; Mammea his sio gode modor, <HI
REND="i">ibid</HI>. 270/26;
mid hire &thorn;&aelig;re yfelan sc&eacute;onnesse, <HI REND="i">Blickling Homilies</HI>, 5/1; openige nu
&thorn;in se f&aelig;gresta f&aelig;&thorn;m, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 7/24; &thorn;onne bi&eth; drihten ure se trumesta
sta&eth;ol, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 13/10; h&eacute; wolde ofersw&iacute;&eth;an &uacute;rne &eth;one &eacute;can d&eacute;a&eth;, <HI
REND="i">&AElig;lfric's
Homilies</HI>, I. 168/1; &uacute;re se &aelig;lmihtiga scyppend,<HI REND="i"> ibid</HI>. I. 192/6;
&thorn;urh his &thorn;&aelig;s mran forryneles and fulluhteres &eth;ingunge, <HI
REND="i">ibid</HI>. I.
364/5.  The article preceding the possessive pronoun: se heora
cyning, <HI REND="i">Orosius</HI>, 56/31; seo heora iugo&eth;, <HI REND="i">Blickling Homilies</HI>, 163/3;
seo hire gebyrd, 163/9, etc.</P>
<P>In Middle English the possessive pronoun apparently has a
determinative meaning (as in Modern English, Modern German, and
Modern French); therefore its connection with the definite article is
made superfluous, while the indefinite article is quite impossible.
Hence arises a certain embarrassment with regard to one case which
the language cannot do without.  Suppose we want to say 'she is in
a castle belonging to her,' where it is of no importance whatever,
either to the speaker or hearer, to know whether 'she' has got more
than one castle&mdash;how could the English of the Middle period put it?
The French of the same age said still 'un sien castel'; but that was
no longer possible in English.  There's only one instance of indefinite
article + possessive pronoun that has come to my knowledge, and that
is of the early period of Middle English: <HI REND="i">Sawles Warde</HI> (<HI
REND="i">O. E. H.</HI>,
I. p. 265): 'for euch an is al mihti to don al &thorn;at he wule, &yogh;e, makie
to cwakien heouene ba ant eor&thorn;e wi&eth; his an finger' (for one is
mighty enough to do all that he desires, yea, to make heaven and
earth quake with one of his fingers.  Translation by R. Morris).<note ID="note.11" > Other instances, however, may have escaped my notice, and it is worth while to search Middle English literature for evidence on this hitherto
puzzling point.</NOTE></P>
<P>We should expect the genitive of the personal pronoun (of me,
etc., as in Modern German),&mdash;and there may have been a time when
this use prevailed,&mdash;but, so far as I know, the language decided in


<pb N="xxi"  ID="pb.22" >
favour of the more complicated and rather absurd construction 'of
mine, of thine,' etc.</P>
<P>This was, in all probability, brought about by the analogy of
the very numerous cases in which the indeterminative noun connected
with mine, etc., had a really partitive sense (cf. the examples
below), and, moreover, by the remembrance of the old construction
with the possessive pronoun.</P>
<P>There is a good deal of guesswork in this explanation, of course;
but one thing is sure&mdash;it was the impossibility of connecting the
indefinite article with the possessive pronoun which suggested the
new construction.  This is proved by indisputable chronological facts.</P>
<P>I. First, we find the indefinite article (or the equally indefinite
words any, every, no) in connection with of mine, of thine, etc.  This
construction is met with in the 14th century.</P>
<P>II. Next, analogy introduces the indefinite article in connection
with the double genitive of a noun, 'a knyght of king Arthur's.'</P>
<P>III. Last, we come across definite pronouns (this, that) in connection
with of mine; and exceptionally the definite article occurs
there also in connection with the double genitive of a noun (the
knight of kyng Arthur's).</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>CHAUCER:</LABEL>A friend of his, IV. 130, IV. 257, IV. 356; an hors

<P>The frequent occurrence of this genitive in connection with
Arthur and his knights has often (in English Grammars, &amp;c.;) suggested
the supposition that there is a sort of ellipsis in this construction:
a knyghte of kynge Arthurs = a knyghte of kynge
Arthurs court.<note ID="note.12" >Cf. two knyghtes of kynge Arthurs Courte, 297/1, 6, 16, 298/33, etc.</NOTE> But first of all, such instances as 'a trusty frende
of syr Tristrams,' 'I am forester of the Emperors,' do not admit of
such an explanation&mdash;unless we say 'among Sir T.'s friends,' 'among
the Emperor's foresters';&mdash;and secondly, there are no other examples
of this elliptic construction in Caxton or Malory.</P>
<P>Of Group III., there are two instances in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> with that,

both instances the partitive genitive is wholly excluded.</P>
<P>B. The Genitive governed by adjectives and verbs is, on the

<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.19" ><HEAD>&sect; 6. The Dative Case.</HEAD>
<P>After the decay of the Old English inflection there was a tendency
to make up for it by the preposition to.  But from the time in which
the <HI REND="i">Old English Homilies</HI> were composed, down to our own days, to
never became the rule.</P>
<P>In CAXTON to is often used after verbs, where we omit it,
especially after tell:&mdash;</P>
<P>Now anon brynge to me myn armes, <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI> 48/15;
but on the same page: he shold brynge hym hys armes, l. 4; after

86/5, etc.</P>
<P>Demand is usually followed by of; but there is an exception,
perhaps brought about by French influence: 'Thenne cam kyng
Alymodes forthe, and demaunded to the stywarde' . . . <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
283/23.  Require, also, occurs with to: <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 168/3; <HI
REND="i">Aymon</HI>,
34/20.  Ask, followed by two objects, occurs: <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 362/31; (he)
asked for hym to two of his men.</P>
<P>There is one instance of offend + to: 'Yf there be ony man here
that I haue offended unto,' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 292/19.</P>
<P>The Ethic Dative is not frequent in Caxton:</P>
<P>'A right grete and impetuouse tempeste rose, that lasted us thre
dayes,' <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 100/9; their sorrowe redoubled them full sore,
ibid. 119/34; the bloode ranne me doune, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 88/19.  (But
ye withdrawen me &thorn;is man.&mdash;Chaucer, <HI REND="i">Boethius</HI>, ed. Morris, p. 7.
Caxton has: fro me.)</P></DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.20" ><HEAD>&sect; 7. The Accusative Case.</HEAD>
<P>A. The Accusative Case, as governed by transitive verbs, sometimes
differs in Caxton from the modern use.</P>
<P>Besides such verbs as 'demand, require, serve, tell,' quoted above,
behold is followed by of, e. g. Aymon, 391/26; and especially noteworthy
is the construction of swear.  In Middle English this verb is
followed by on.  Cf. <HI REND="i">Chaucer</HI>, IV. 363: and this on every God
celestial I swere it yow, V. 222.  Caxton uses 'swear' as a transitive
verb, and makes the accusative case follow it: he sware his Godes,
<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 92/25, 107/22; swore God, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 38/4, 73/14, 87/10,
185/4, 201/33, 459/11, 471/7, 515/7, 526/17.  In <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI> are only
three examples of 'swear' followed by a preposition: (he) sware by
God, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 61/29; he sware by saint Denys, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 411/11; I swere
upon all sayntes, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 85/4.</P>
<P>From one passage of the <HI REND="i">Ayenbite</HI>, and another in <HI
REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
we may safely infer that this use is due to French influence.

</P>
<pb N="xxv"  ID="pb.26" ><P><HI REND="i">Ayenbite</HI>, p. 6: huo &thorn;et zuere&thorn; wi&thorn;-oute skele &thorn;ane name of oure
lhorde . . . he him uorzuere&thorn;, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 107/22; The kynge of
polonye . . . sware his goode goddes, that he sholde neuer haue
loye at his herte.  Original: 'jura ses bons dieux.'</P>
<P>Dan Michel always translates literally; and Caxton too, in this
case, introduced the French construction.</P>
<P>The Cognate Object occurs several times:</P>
<P>And there she had not been no longe whyle, when she had
perceyued the playn choys and syght of a right grete and myghty
nauye, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 56/2; (choys = syght). deye a shamefull dethe,
ibid. 190/4, and very often in the other works of Caxton.  I rebuke
hym neuer for no hate that I hated hym, <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 349/4; the
good loue that I haue loued you . . . <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 364/4.</P>
<P>B. The Accusative absolute is used with great freedom by Caxton
and Malory, and even by Berners.  Instances abound.  I quote only
a few to illustrate my statement:&mdash;</P>
<P>He fonde hym the terres (= tears) at the eyes of him makynge
his full pituouse complayntes, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> 123/24; (there) he toke
a bote, prest and garnysshed wyth eight goode felawes, eche of them
an ore in his hande . . . <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 154/7; The good erle, then, the
prouost, and the knyghte of the fery, their swerdes in their handes
naked, toke and seysyd her by force, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 180/19; Thenne came
syluayn, his felawes wyth hym, and ascryed the two barons to dethe,
<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 205/19.  Original: 'siluain auant auec ses compaignons.'</P>
<P>C. For the Accusative with Infinitive, see Infinitive, p. lxx.</P>
<P>D. The Adverbial Object exhibits some peculiarities worth stating.</P>
<P>(a) Time.  Never the days of her lyff she sholde wedde paynem
nor no man infidele, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 65/15.  Malory has: neuer his
lif, 127/23; cf. Chaucer.  Imeneus, that god of weddyng is, Seigh
neuer his lif so mery a weddid man, II. 333; many a wighte hath
loued thynge he neuer saugh his lyue, V. 8 (cf. <HI REND="i">Einenkel</HI>, p. 52;
Zupitza, note to <HI REND="i">Guy of Warwick</HI>, ll. 1747-8); (he) wend neuer to
haue come tyme enough, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 158/4.  Original: 'a tans
(temps).'  Cf. 170/5; <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 265/19, 343/5; <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 228/24;
<HI REND="i">Huon</HI>, 332/8, 334/10.</P>
<P>That tyme, in <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 48/8, is equivalent to 'at that
tyme,'<HI REND="i"> ibid</HI>. 49/16.  Cf. the same tyme, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 127/13, 128/8,
143/29; and at that same houre, 139/8; at the tyme, 194/32;

Cf. <HI REND="i">Einenkel</HI>, p. 66.</P>
</DIV4><DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.21" ><HEAD>&sect; 8. The Article.</HEAD>
<P>There are several remarkable peculiarities about Caxton's use of
the Article.</P>
<P>(a) Nouns in the Vocative case are preceded by the definite
article instead of O:&mdash;</P>
<P>'Sith that we haue lost thee, farewell the ioye of this world!'
<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 574/30; 'Then syr Launcelot cryed: the knyght wyth the
blak shelde, make the redy to Iuste wyth me!' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>,
392/16.</P>
<P>(b) Possessive Pronouns used substantively are sometimes preceded
by the definite Article:&mdash;</P>
<P>'Thenne toke the prouost his spere, and so dyde Blanchardyn the
his,' <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 48/20 (Original: <FOREIGN LANG="fre">la sienne</FOREIGN>); I praye you that
euery man force hymself to do worthily hys deuoyr, that your worship
and the oures be kepte, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 72/21; In whiche he hath not rendred
the reason or made any decision, to approve better the his than that
other, <HI REND="i">Eneydos</HI>, 23/19.</P>
<P>(c) Numerals denoting part of a whole are sometimes preceded by
the definite Article:&mdash;</P>
<P>'And yf perauenture one of them dare not come allone hardyly,
late come the two or thre or foure of the moost valyauntest' . . .
<HI REND="i">Charles the Grete,</HI> 41/27; and yf the foure dare not come, late come
fyue, ibid. 29.  Cf. <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 355/5: wete thou wel, said sir
Tristram, the one of us shalle dye or we departe.</P>
<P>In all these three groups Caxton copied only too faithfully his
French originals.  I do not know of any other Middle English
instance of 'the his'; but as for 'the two,' there is the authority of
Chaucer and the unknown translator of the <HI REND="i">Romaunt of the Rose</HI>, if
not to sanction it as a good Middle English expression, at least to
excuse it:</P>
<P>And sins he ran . . . And borwed him large boteles thre; and in
the two his poysoun poured he; The thrid he keped clene for his
<pb N="xxvii"  ID="pb.28" >
drynke, <HI REND="i">Cant. T</HI>. III. 103; And if thou maist so fer forth wynne,
That thou resoun derst byginne, And woldist seyn thre thingis or mo,
Thou shalt fulle scarsly seyn the two.&mdash;<HI REND="i">Romaunt of the Rose</HI>, V. 77/8.</P>
<P>Perhaps the following expressions too may be attributed to
French influence:&mdash;</P>
<P>The captayne gaff the goode nyght to the damoyselle, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
51/27 (Original: <FOREIGN LANG="fre">la bonne nuit</FOREIGN>); and gaff hym the goode nyght,
<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 74/26; onely the captayne of Tormaday, that cam for to make
unto her the reuerence, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 51/17.  Cf. 77/2, 158/16: Blanchardyn
coude not kepe hymself, but that the grete teerys dropped fast out of
his eyen, ibid. 145/33.</P>
<P>(d) Before two adjectives qualifying one noun, the Article is
often repeated:&mdash;</P>
<P>He sawe there under in a playn a moche ample and a grete
medowe, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 32/2; the prouoste of the towne dyde ordeyne
a stronge and a bygge warde, 58/20; ye be enamored of a hyghe
and a ryche pryncesse, 75/7; he was a ryght valyaunt and a hardy
prynce, 113/20; makyng a grete and a solempne oath, 177/16.&mdash;There
are, in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, but two exceptions<note ID="note.13" >These are where Caxton is writing his own English, not englishing another man's French.  I wish all his Prologues and Epilogues, as collected
in Blades's quarto, could be examined for other contrasts of his phrascology.&mdash;F.
J. F.</NOTE>: A noble and
victorious prynce, 1/26; the rude and comyn englysshe, 2/9.</P>
<P>(e) The definite article is repeated where one of the two adjectives
is in close connection with the noun.  Thus in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> 'proude'
and 'pucelle' are looked upon as one noun, hence the following
expressions:&mdash;</P>
<P>The right gracious and fayre, the proude pucelle in amours, 76/30;
the fayer, the proude pucell, 83/12; the right desolate, the
proude pucelle, 89/29; cf. 94/9, 96/7, 127/10, 129/29.  There are
two exceptions: the fayr pucelle and proude in amours, 128/8; the
fayr proude mayden, 131/10.</P>
<P>(f) There are three instances (in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>) of the indefinite
article used in analogy to such + adjective + a:&mdash;</P>
<P>It nedeth not to be doubted that he is come to his extremyte
of prowes and valyantes, wythout that amours hathe be the cause in
the persone of some hyghe a pryncesse, 72/20; hy gaf to hym-self
grete merueylle, and was wel abashed of that soudayne a wylle that
was come to hym, 126/9; which is the most fayr, and the most



<pb N="xxviii"  ID="pb.29" >
noble, and the most complete a lady, and most pleasaunt of all the
remnaunt of the world, 156/13.</P>
</DIV4><DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.22" ><HEAD>&sect; 9. The Adjective.</HEAD>
<P>For adjectives used substantively see &ograve; 1, p. vi.  For the arrangement
of noun and adjective see the chapter below, on 'The Arrangement
of Words.'  The tautology in the formation of the comparative
and superlative degree (more better, most best) so well known from
Shakspere, occurs here and there in Caxton, and is extremely
frequent in <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>:&mdash;</P>
<P>more werse, <HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 23/33; more better, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 91/35; the most
valyauntest, <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 41/27; more sonner,<HI
REND="i"> ibid</HI>. 44/18;
most next,<HI REND="i"> ibid</HI>. 44/17; more gretter, <HI REND="i">Curial</HI>, 5/13.  <HI

74/37, 142/8, 144/29, 35; 148/5, 215/29, 218/3, etc.</P>
<P>Adjectives referring to preceding nouns are not yet followed
by one:&mdash;</P>
<P>So grete a stroke and so heuy he gaffe hym, <HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 62/22; god
hath well kept hym from so moche an hap and so hyghe, 75/24; a
trusty man and secret, 81/23, 86/17, 97/20, 110/2, 156/14, 163/4,
169/17, 178/2, 179/5, 200/29.  <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 392/9, 504/20.  <HI
REND="i">Morte

<P>But the Middle English use of 'one' following a noun is met
with in Malory several times:&mdash;</P>
<P>There lyueth not a bygger knyght than he is one, 72/22; (it)

ouermatched, 87/35; such yong knyghtes as he is one . . . ben neuer
abydynge in no place, 251/25.  Cf. Chaucer: For in my tyme a
seruaunt was I on, II. 56, V. 112.  The oldest instance quoted by
M&auml;tzner, <HI REND="i">Glossar</HI>, is from <HI REND="i">Robert of Gloucester</HI>, p. 17: 'a wonder
maister was he on;' but without the preceding article, the use goes

separated from the subject by any adverbial, participial, or adjectival
(relative) clause, a personal pronoun is pleonastically inserted to
mark the subject:&mdash;</P>

<P>Caxton is extremely free in omitting the pronoun.  The instances
occurring may be divided into the following groups:&mdash;</P>
<P>1. When the subject is the same in two co-ordinate sentences, it
is omitted in the second.  The omission is striking, whenever there
is a clause inserted between the two principal sentences:&mdash;</P>
<P>So ranne the vasselles to gyder, and roughte eche other by suche

a long speech; then the author continues:] and thenne (that is,
after the speech) wythout taryeng drewe his swerde (namely, the
provost), 49/29.  On p. 52 the subject for the first sentence of the
16th chapter must be supplied from the preceding chapter:&mdash;whan
the proude lady in amours understode the squyer speke thus, the
bloode ranne up at her face, and [she] wexed red as a rose, 64/16;
wherof the provost was not lesse reioysshed than blanchardyn was.
The dyner was redy, and [they] made an ende of their proces tyl

127/4, 146/9, 157/3, 170/29, 174/20, 195/22, 203/29.</P>
<P>2. When the subject is the same in a principal and a subordinate
sentence, the pronoun is omitted in one of them.</P>
<P>(a) Pronoun omitted in the subordinate sentence:&mdash;

</P>
<pb N="xxxiv"  ID="pb.35" ><P>Blanchardyn emonge other passetymes, delyted hymself in hawkynge

169/13.</P>
<P>(b) Pronoun omitted in the principal sentence:&mdash;</P>
<P>And for tabredge, after the rewthes, syghes and wepynges that so
moche incessantly or wythout ceasse made the noble pucelle, [she]

cf. 30/20, 49/11, 52/21, 53/24, 54/6, 65/3, 127/16.</P>
<P>3. When the subject of a subordinate sentence is not the same
as that of the principal one, and is yet omitted, it must be supplied
from the ontext.</P>
<P>How be it I knowe right wel, and make no doubt at all, but that

<P>4. It preceding impersonal verbs is omitted.</P>
<P>There are but two instances of this omission in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>:&mdash;</P>
<P>But [it] seemed that she sholde slee herself to be more hastely
venged, 43/26; so [it] taryed not long after thys was doon that the

<P>B. A pronoun as object is very rarely omitted.</P>
<P>'But the knyght that was ryght courteys, guyded hym and conduyted
a whyle,' <HI REND="i">Blanch</HI>. 39/30, is scarcely to be called an omission
(see 'Arrangement of Words,' p. ci); but the pronoun is certainly
wanting in the following passage: 'For as to his fadir, he wolde not
touche,' <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 85/29.  Cf. Starkey, <HI REND="i">England in the Reign of
Henry VII</HI>, 71/66: as for thys matter we shal ryght wel avoyd.</P>

<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 339/13.</P></DIV4><DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.25" ><HEAD>&sect; 11. The Reflexive Pronoun.</HEAD>
<P>Both the simple and the compound forms occur, but the latter
are apparently the rule.  Of thirty instances occurring on the first
forty-two pages of <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, only three are simple, namely, 1/22,
2/10, 41/21.</P></DIV4><DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.26" ><HEAD>&sect; 12. The Possessive Pronoun.</HEAD>
<P>(a) My, thy, are used before consonants; mine, thine, before
vowels.  Its never occurs; in its place we find his, as in Old and
Middle English.  For the possessive pronouns used substantively,
'mine, thine, ours, yours' is the rule; 'our, your' occur, but quite
exceptionally:&mdash;</P>
<P>I haue herde that ye haue called me and my broder the sones of
a traytour, and that the kyng knoweth well that our fader slewe
yours by trayson, wherof I wylle ye wyte that ye lie falsely, but
your fader dyde assaylle our by trayson, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 545/10; Ye wolle
enforce yourselfe to rescue oute of daunger of deth, my lorde and
youre, my good husband Sadoyne, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 189/25.  his is
sometimes preceded by the definite article.  See 'Article,' p. xxvi.</P>
<P>The possessive pronouns are sometimes preceded by this: 'This
their message,' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 160/30.  Cf. above, &ograve; 5, on the
Genitive Case, p. xv.</P>
<P>(b) The possessive pronoun my is used as a term of courtesy.  It
occurs very frequently in connection with lady, so as to form almost
one word.  This is made evident by the repetition of my in the
following instances:&mdash;</P>
<P>Unto the right noble puyssaunt and excellent pryncesse, my
redoubted lady, my lady Margarete, duchesse of Somercete, etc.,
<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI> (Dedication), 1/2; I haue told you her byfore, that
the paynem kynge Alymodes apparreylleth hymself to make werre
<pb N="xxxvi"  ID="pb.37" >

I byleue certeynly that he shall doo soo, for the kindness that my
lorde my fader dyde shewe unto Charlemagne, <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 427/33; I
praye you ryde unto my lorde myn unkel kynge Arthur, <HI REND="i">Morte
Darthur</HI>, 267/32.  I met with only one exception:  At yonder
wyndowe is my lady syster dame Lyones, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 237/3.</P>
<P>Instead of 'my lady his moder,' Caxton says several times his
lady moder: <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 57/34, 62/20, 81/13.</P>
<P>(c) The possessive pronoun is often replaced by the genitive of
the personal pronoun: the head of him = his head.  See 'Genitive.'</P>
<P>(d) his instead of the genitival inflexion 's is very rare:&mdash;</P>
<P>And with that renne, blanchardyn his courser ran ouer &thorn;e provost
that he tradd upon one of his armes, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 48/35; to what
thynge Charles hys sone and hys doughters were instructe and taughte
to doo, <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 28/1; this lord of this castel, his name is
syr Damas, <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 126/17 (not exactly equal to a genitive);
the fyrste knyghte hys hors stumbled,<HI REND="i"> ibid</HI>. 220/30.</P>
<P>(e) mine is sometimes equivalent to of me used in an objective
sense.  It occurs in connection with the gerund, and translates the
French <FOREIGN LANG="fre">mon</FOREIGN>, etc.  'Thou knowest well, that I dyde was in my deffendynge,'
<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 88/26; 'it was I that slewe this knyght in my deffendaunt,'
<HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 83/25.  This is false analogy to the other
gerundial constructions, like 'in my talking,' etc., formed out of the
intransitive or transitive verbs.  There is a parallel passage in
Chaucer:&mdash;'Another homicidy is doon for necessite, as whan a man
sleth another in his defendaunt,' III. 312.  One MS., however, has
him defendaunt.<note ID="note.14" >Perhaps the following passage cannot be explained in the same way:&mdash;'Syre, ye be a right fayre Iouncell . . . and to my seming right wel worthy to
haue the grace and fauour of the right gentyll damoyselle,' Blanchardyn,
37/22.  Probably 'seem' is here 'think'; 'to my thinking' is still in use.

<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.29" ><HEAD>&sect; 15. The Relative Pronoun.</HEAD>
<P>(A.) The relative clause either follows its antecedent, or rather
correlative, or precedes it.  Accordingly we find two sorts of relative
pronouns in Caxton:&mdash;</P>
<P>I. That, which, the which, whom, where, as.</P>
<P>II. Who, who that, whosoever (whomsoever).</P>
<P>(I.) That is used of persons and things, especially after pronouns
(he, that), but is restricted to the nominative and accusative case,
when used alone, and is never preceded by a preposition.  Of all
the relative pronouns it is by far the most frequent.</P>
<P>'That' conveys a vague idea of reference; this is its function
compared with the other relative pronouns.  It answers thus to

the Hebrew ascher.</P>
<P>Dr. Abbott's rule with regard to the Elizabethan use of that
does not apply to Caxton.  That is not only used (a) after a noun
preceded by the article, (b) after nouns used vocatively, in order to
complete the description of the antecedent by adding some essential
characteristics of it.  Cf. the following passages:&mdash;</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>That</LABEL> used of persons: <HI

<P>(B.) Relative pronouns in the sentence.<note ID="note.16" >For convenience' sake I prefer to discuss this important point in this place, instead of in the Syntax of the Sentence, as the system requires.</NOTE></P>
<P>The structure of the relative clauses in Caxton is far from being
the same as in Modern English.  There are three principal types of
relative constructions:&mdash;</P>
<P>(I.) The antecedent or correlative is a noun in a complete sentence,
which is followed by a many-worded adjective or relative clause:&mdash;</P>
<P>'She conceyued a ryght faire sone, whiche was named Blanchardyn.'&mdash;<HI
REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
12/12.</P>
<P>(a) If the relative pronoun is in the nominative case, the construction,
as a rule, is the same as in Modern English.  There are
only a few exceptions:&mdash;</P>
<pb N="xli"  ID="pb.42" ><LIST><ITEM><P>Ine &thorn;ise zen&yogh;e&thorn; moche uolk: ine uele maneres . ase &thorn;ise fole

<P>(b) The relative is an oblique case.  Then, as a rule, the relatives
enumerated above are used in connection with the corresponding
preposition: 'Of whom, to whom, whom or which,' etc.  But there
are exceptions in this case too.  Instead of the simple relatives, there
occur</P>

saunce pyte took that shelde from her, 345/11, 12.</P>
<P>This use continued in the 16th century:&mdash;</P>

yonder two prynces that goth up the stayres, and that so moch
honour is done to them, 286/9.</P>
<P>Very rarely is a relative in the oblique case followed by a redundant
personal pronoun:-</P>
<P>(they) were all murderers, wherof the pryncypall and the mayster
of them all was named syluayne, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 204/8; It is by cause
ther is come in to thy court he that hath slayne my brother whom
incontynente thou oughtest to haue slayne hym quyke, <HI REND="i">Huon</HI>,
141/24.</P>
<P>The edition of 1601 omits hym.  There is perhaps a change of the
construction in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 192/29: 'they recountred a peynem,
which they toke, and broughte hym before Blanchardyn.'</P>
<P>(II.) The correlative sentence is divided into two parts by the
relative clause:&mdash;</P>
<P>'He that wyll be enhaunced in price, he oughte not to loke soo
nyghe.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, 354/23.</P>
<P>In Old and Middle English this type is nearly always a sort of
anacoluthon to our modern eyes and ears, and perhaps it was such
indeed.  The essential point in which this construction differs from
the modern use is, that the correlative always appears in the nominative
case, without regard to its place in the sentence; it is only the
redundant pronoun, personal or possessive, in the second part, which
marks the subjective or objective case of the correlative, e. g., in
Modern English we might say:&mdash;'To her who was not skilled in
receiving such guests, his acquaintance was hard to make,' but
Caxton has:&mdash;'and she that was not lerned to receyue suche geestes,
sore harde was his acquaintance to her.'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 67/29, 30.</P>
<pb N="xliii"  ID="pb.44" ><P>Accordingly I distinguish two groups of type II.</P>
<P>(a) The correlative is the subject of the sentence.  Then the
redundant personal pronoun appears in the nominative case.</P>
<P>This pronoun is, as said above (see 'Personal Pronoun'), very
frequent in Old English and Middle English.  Perhaps we might
say that this is the rule; at least the <HI REND="i">Old English Homilies</HI> seem to
suggest such a supposition.  There are in the Second Series twenty-three
instances of the redundant pronoun, namely, p. 15, l. 4 from
top; p. 15, l. 4 from foot; p. 19, l. 9 from top; p. 43, l. 3 from
top; p. 45, l. 16 from foot, and on pages 69 (twice), 73, 75, 99,
115 (twice), 133 (twice), 143, 153 (three times), 155, 159, 201,
203, 207; while only six passages omit it, namely, on pages 11, 17,
19, 73, 111, 151.</P>
<P>In Caxton this is no longer the case.  There is not one instance
of the group (a) in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>; and in <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI> they are not very
numerous.  See 'Personal Pronoun.'</P>
<P>(b) The correlative is the object (direct or indirect) of the sentence;
then, as a rule, it is in the nominative case, and the redundant
personal pronoun is either in the genitive (his, her, their) or dative
(accusative) case:&mdash;</P>

Malory, <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 174/13.</P>
<P>There is one instance in Malory in which&mdash;if Caxton or his
compositor did not introduce a first gaf not in the author's copy&mdash;both
the old and modern uses are mixed in one: 'Thenne the kyng
stablysshed all his knyghtes and [gaf] them that were of londes not
ryche, he gaf them londes . . .' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 118/13.  Malory
(if the first gaf was his) began with the modern construction: 'and
gaf them that were of londes not ryche (londes),' but in the second
half of the sentence he found it would be quite confusing and
impossible to add 'londes' only to his long adjective 'that were of
londes not ryche,' and he therefore repeated the words which
governed 'londes,' the old use suggesting itself to his memory as a
justification for his cumbrousness.  This use occurs very often in
Berners:&mdash;</P>
<P>The londe that they hold, gyue it to Charlot your sone, <HI REND="i">Huon</HI>,
5/13; with my sworde I so defendyd me, that he that thought to
haue slayne me, I haue slayne hym, 27/5, 6; he that lieth there deed
before you, I slew him in my defence, 34/11; all the mete that he
could get in the towne, he shuld by it, 84/33.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.32" ><HEAD>&sect; 17. Impersonal Verbs.</HEAD>
<P>(A.) The Impersonal Verbs denoting natural or else external
events, as raining, thundering, freezing, etc., have remained the same,
with regard to their syntactical use, from Old English down to
modern times.  We say still: it rains (O. E. hit r&icirc;n&eth;), it thunders
(O. E. hit &thorn;unra&eth;), it freezes (O. E. hit fre&oacute;se&eth;), it<note ID="note.19" >This it is a false subject, to throw the true subject after the verb.</NOTE> happens that, &amp;c.;
(O. E. hit gelimpe&eth;), etc.</P>
<P>But those Verbs which express states or actions of the human
mind have undergone an important change.  As stated above (see
p. xi, 'Nominative Case'), many once Impersonal Verbs became
personal, and we have now but a few instances of such verbs as 'it<note ID="note.20" >This it is a false subject, to throw the true subject after the verb.</NOTE>
seems to me, it<note ID="note.21" >This it is a false subject, to throw the true subject after the verb.</NOTE> pleases me.'</P>
<P>In Caxton we see this tendency at work, but the change from
impersonal to personal verbs is far from being complete.  Here is an
alphabetical list of the impersonal verbs in Caxton and Malory;
those used personally, too, are marked with *:&mdash;</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>*ail,</LABEL> Middle English eilen, impersonal, and so it is in Caxton.

his French original.
</P><pb N="xlviii"  ID="pb.49" ><P>Caxton does not use the word, which he replaces by 'rewe' and
'repent'; but there are several instances in <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>: 'Me

'Ha, false and renyed strompet, I were me leuer ded, than
that I sholde byleue nor doo thi cursed counseyll,' <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 185/32.
It is composed out of the two constructions struggling one with
another in the author's mind.  Similar absurdities occur in <HI REND="i">Chaucer</HI>:
Him hadde wel leever . . . That she hadde a ship, II. 109; Him
lever had himselfe to mordre and dye, V. 323.  See <HI REND="i">Einenkel</HI>, p. 112;

<P>(B.) There is another sort of Impersonal Verbs, which denote
neither external events nor actions of the mind.  These are the verbs
reherce, show, tell, occurring in Malory, as in Middle English,
without any subject.  The context proves that we have to supply
'the author,' 'the book,' though sometimes we find 'in the booke':&mdash;</P>
<P>After they were wedded, as it telleth in the booke, <HI REND="i">Morte
Darthur</HI>, 63/18; as it telleth after, 63/35; as it telleth in the book

Balyn le saueage, that foloweth next after, 75/17; as it telleth after
in the sangraylle, 91/27; as it reherceth afore, 105/11.  I found only
one instance in Caxton.  The heading of chapter xvii. of <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>
runs as follows:&mdash;Here sheweth how reynawde faught agenst rowland,

<P>The peculiarity of forming the passive voice from intransitive
verbs, which is characteristic of the English language, or rather the




<pb N="lv"  ID="pb.56" >
conversion of what is the object of a verb into the subject (he was
given a book), is, so far as I am aware, not to be met with in Caxton,
and I found only one instance in Malory.  Cf. the following
instances:&mdash;</P>
<P>As was tolde hym by the knyght, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 43/1; all that
was told hym, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 196/20; and whan it was told the kynges that

<P>This rigid observation of the difference between transitive and

</DIV4><DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.36" ><HEAD TYPE="supplied">&sect; 21. Verbal Forms</HEAD><P>There are verbal forms which, in Old English, were indifferent
with regard to voice.  These were the infinitive, the verbal

<P>In Middle English there is a faint beginning of creating new
passive constructions of the infinitive and gerund by means of the

passive infinitive and gerund is not complete.</P>
<P>In Caxton there is a distinct tendency towards the modern use,
but still the active constructions prevail.  The Infinitive, Gerund,

instances will suffice:&mdash;</P>

<P>(f) With regard to the agreement between the tenses in principal
sentences and clauses, the strictness of our modern rules, adopted
from the Latin grammar, is still unknown, and, in particular, the
Preterite in the principal sentence is often followed by the Present
in the clause.  This is due to a sort of anacoluthon.  There is, as it
were, a sudden transition from indirect to direct speech, which is
indeed very common in Middle English, as well as in Caxton and
Malory:&mdash;</P>

<P>Caxton's use of the Subjunctive is nearly modern; in the sentences,
however, which express a wish, the synthetic use is remarkable.
Instead of the modern 'may god help me' there is 'so helpe
me God'; instead of 'might it please God,' 'pleased God,' etc.  This,
however, is very common, and is continued in the poetry of even
modern times.  But there is another point worth noting.  There are
several instances of the Indicative instead of the Subjunctive Mood,
which seem to suggest that the modern tendency of supplanting the
Subjunctive may be traced back to Caxton's time, or still earlier.</P>

<P>While, as mentioned above, the Infinitive in Old English&mdash;as well
as in the other Teutonic languages&mdash;was indifferent with regard to
voice, the later periods of Middle English develope the passive on the
same principle as Latin, and are probably modelled on that.  Whenever
there is an action without a subject to do it, we find the passive
construction in Latin&mdash;<FOREIGN LANG="lat">infinitivus passivi</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="lat">participium passivi</FOREIGN> (or
rather <FOREIGN LANG="lat">gerundium</FOREIGN>), e. g. <FOREIGN LANG="lat">militem occidi iussit; credendum est</FOREIGN>.  So
far as I am aware both these constructions are translated in Old
English, as well as in Middle English of the first centuries, by the
simple infinitive.  Instances abound:&mdash;</P>

<P>I have tried in vain to find any trace of this use in earlier days,
and can only account for it in the following way.  There is an outspoken
tendency in the English of the 14th century to supplant
adverbial clauses of time, and express a condition by absolute constructions:&mdash;</P>
<P>&thorn;e same Plato lyvyng, hys maistre socrates deservede victorie
of unri&yogh;tful dee&thorn; in my presence, Chaucer's <HI REND="i">Boece</HI>, 184 (original:
<FOREIGN LANG="fre">'eodemque superstite praeceptor ejus Socrates injustae victoriam

of his harm the roote, Anon he yaf the syke man his boote, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>.
II. 14.</P>
<P>As appears by the preceding examples, both participles serve to
represent clauses in the present and past tenses.  But how about the
future?  Why should there be no absolute construction for a clause
with a future tense?  The want of a proper participle did not prevent
the language from completing the use of absolute constructions.  It
resorted to the Infinitive.  Wycliffe tried to introduce a future participle.
'He was to dyinge,'&mdash;<HI REND="i">Lucas</HI>, I. 2 (erat moriturus); 'to doynge,'
<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 22, 23 (facturus).  But this innovation was not accepted.
There is, however, a similar formation in Caxton: 'Guy, hir loue
and tocoming husband,' <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 134/27, i. e. that was to
be; 'Our tocomyng souerayne lorde,' <HI REND="i">Blades</HI>, 139/140; it occurs also
in <HI REND="i">Piers Plowman</HI>.  Cf. Skeat, Notes, p. 371, and Trevisa, <HI
REND="i">Polychr</HI>.
I. 267.  This probably gave birth to that peculiar use which, in the
course of its development, became more and more free, so that in the
15th century the Infinitive Absolute often serves to alternate with
any principal sentence and clause:&mdash;</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV4.49" ><HEAD>&sect; 34. The Verbal Noun.</HEAD>
<P>The verbal noun in Caxton, with its functions of noun and verb,
may be traced back to two different sources.</P>
<P>(A.) When used as a noun, it derives from the Old English <GAP
DESC='text blank after partially printed letters "lish" in English.' REASON="omitted in printing" EXTENT="possibly two words">
noun in -ung, -ing.  Instances of it are very common <GAP
DESC='text blank after partially printed "n" in "common"' REASON="text omitted in printing of edition" EXTENT="possibly two-three words">
<pb N="lxxv"  ID="pb.76" >
in modern times.  It is only worth noting when it forms part of a
compound:&mdash;</P>

<P>The more modern phrase 'the house is building'<note ID="note.28" >It is a pity that 'is being built,' &amp;c.;, tend to displace this construction.</NOTE> is not met
with in Caxton; he has still a (or in) preceding the verbal noun:&mdash;</P>

REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 84/12, 389/7.</P>
<P>(B.) The verbal noun is used as a verb: then it derives from the
present participle.</P>
<P>1. Governed by the preposition in.</P>
<P>We now use in in connection with the verbal noun, where, in
Old English, the simple participle was preferred, e. g. 'ealo drincende
o&eth;er s&aelig;don' = others said in drinking ale, Beowulf, <HI REND="i">1946</HI>.  I




<pb N="lxxvi"  ID="pb.77" >
suppose that in, imitated from the French, was grafted upon the old
participle, so that it kept its verbal function.  Therefore it was not
followed by of, even in the earliest periods of its use:&mdash;</P>
<P>And thei seye, that we synne dedly, in schavynge oure Berdes,&mdash;
<HI REND="i">Maundeville</HI>, p. 19; he was a dedly Creature, suche as God hadde
formed, and duelled in the Desertes, in purchasynge his Sustynance,
<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. p. 47; and in bryngynge hire Servyse, thei syngen a Song, <HI
REND="i">ibid</HI>.
p. 310.</P>
<P>Caxton very often drops in, as in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 14/20, 16/8,
18/8, 33/12, etc.  But even when it precedes the verbal noun, it is
not followed by of:&mdash;</P>
<P>I am come to serue her in kepyng my worship,&mdash;<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>,
76/11; and in tornynge hemself ayen, [they] layde hande on their
swerdes, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 84/27; euery man cam forth to doo his deuoyre, eche
of hem in his rowme in defendynge the place,&mdash;<HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 113/4, 123/17;
<HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 26/34, 52/11, 66/34, 85/23, 163/19, etc.</P>
<P>2. There are a few passages in Caxton, which, in my opinion,
throw a most interesting light on the use of the verbal noun, both
in Middle English and in modern times.  'Most humblie beseekynge
my . . . lord to pardon me so presumyng,' <HI REND="i">Blades</HI>, 140; 'take no
displaysir on me so presuming,' <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 148.  Cf. 165.  I see in this
construction a mode of expression which was the only one used in
old times, and which still remains in vulgar English: 'don't mind me
sitting down.'</P>
<P>In Old English, as well as in Latin, Greek, and the old Teutonic
languages, it is not the action or state as an abstract, but the
person or thing acting, which is the subject of perception, feeling,
or thought.  '<FOREIGN LANG="lat">hac literae recitatae magnum luctum fecerunt</FOREIGN>' = the
reading of this letter, <HI REND="i">Livius</HI>, 27, 29; '<FOREIGN LANG="lat">poena violatae religionis iustam
recusationem non habet</FOREIGN>' = for the violation of religion,&mdash;Cicero, <HI
REND="i">De
Leg</HI>., 2, 15.</P>
<P>To this principle are due many of the so-called absolute constructions
in the Old Teutonic dialects.  See <HI REND="i">Grimm</HI>, IV. 873, ff.</P>
<P>It appears also in the noun-clauses in Old and Middle English.
Instead of the modern abstract sentence, e. g. 'you see that he's going
away,' the old construction is, 'you see him that he goes away.'  So
<HI REND="i">Old English Hom</HI>., I. 17; '&yogh;if &thorn;u hine ise&yogh;e &thorn;et he wulle assottie to
<pb N="lxxvii"  ID="pb.78" >
&thorn;es deofles.'  See below, 'Noun Clauses.'  The same principle appears
also in the following instances illustrating the older use:&mdash;</P>
<P>Be &thorn;e lifigendum (during thy life time), <HI REND="i">Be&oacute;wulf</HI>, 2666; be &thorn;&aelig;m
lifigendum, <HI REND="i">Beda</HI>, 2, 5; To-janes &thorn;o sunne risindde = at the time of
sunrise, <HI REND="i">Old English Miscellany</HI>, 26.</P><LIST><ITEM><P><Q><l  ID="l.115" >'Alle waters als &thorn;ai sall rynne</L><l  ID="l.116" >And &thorn;at sal last fra &thorn;e son rysyng</L><l  ID="l.117" >Til &thorn;e tyme of &thorn;e son doungangyng.'</L></Q><BIBL><HI

REND="i">Genesis</HI>, 28, 11.</BIBL></ITEM></LIST><P>In later times this use began to decay, as indeed in every respect
abstraction supplanted intuition, and the verbal noun took the place
of the old present participle.  Thus Purvey alters the instance quoted
above to 'aftir the goyng down of the sunne.'  Cf. <HI REND="i">Exod</HI>. xxii. 26,
<HI REND="i">Deuteronomy</HI> xi. 30.  Perhaps we may see the state of transition in
the following passages of the <HI REND="i">Ayenbite</HI>.  The old participle is kept in
its outward form, but the new use, i. e. the verbal noun, throws its
shade on the construction.  Thus we have: '&yogh;ef he zuere&thorn; fals be his
wytinde,' p. 6.  'Be him wytinde' would answer to the Old English
'lifigendum'; 'be his wytinge' would be quite modern (as it really
occurs, see below); the connection of both gives 'be his wytinde.'
Cf. pp. 8, 28, 37, 40, 47, 94, etc.  The French has: '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">&agrave; son (leur)
escient</FOREIGN>.'</P>
<P>Both the mixed and the modern construction occur on p. 73,
<HI REND="i">Ayenb</HI>.: 'guo into helle ine &thorn;ine libbinde: &thorn;et &thorn;ou ne guo ine &thorn;ine
steruinge' (original: '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">en ton vivant, en ton morant</FOREIGN>').</P>
<P>The extremely free use of the verbal noun as an adjective to substantives,
which is characteristic of Elizabethan English ('undeserving
praise,' 'unrecalling crime' in Shakspere) is not met with in Caxton.
Perhaps these are worth noting: 'fallyng sekeness,' <HI REND="i">Charles the
Grete</HI>, 37/28; 'weepyng teerys,' <HI REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI>, 338/9.  Cf. <HI

<DIV3 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV3.55" ><HEAD>&sect; 39. Co-ordination instead of Subordination.</HEAD>
<P>It is a well-known characteristic feature of poetical style to use
sentences as co-ordinate ones, which, logically, stand in the relation
of subordination.  But Caxton's prose also exhibits several striking
instances of this use.  Two principal sentences are asyndetically
joined together, where we should expect a principal sentence and a
subordinate clause:&mdash;</P>
<P>Whan he see Blanchardyn, that all prest was to furnyshe hys
enterpryse, gaffe to hymselfe grete meruaylle, and praised hym but
litell, he asked hym of whens he was.  Blanchardyn answerd, that for
no drede nor fere that he had of hym he shuld kepe his name from
hym, <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, 84/3; whan the sarrasyns saw the kynge of the
gyauntes dede they were sore frayed and gretly abashed, for in hym
was alle their hope.  they fled toward their tentes as faste as they
myght.  Blanchardyn and they of Tormaday pursued them, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>.
87/14, 15; Sadoyne behelde the pucell beatryx that so gentyl was
and so odly fayr, he enbraced and kyssed her, sayeng, <HI REND="i">ibid</HI>. 143/21.
Cf. 33/2, 39/16, 141/25, 168/24.</P>
<P>In the prose of the sixteenth century I noticed this use only in
Berners:&mdash;
<pb N="xcv"  ID="pb.96" >
</P>
<P>So he went to hys lodgyng sorowfull and in grete dyspleasure,
and than he imagyned and studyed on the mater, and howe to

went to Charlot the kynges sone, with whome he was ryght pryuey;

to Old English &eth;onne&mdash;&eth;onne = when, then.)  Cf. 134/20, 149/6&mdash;9,
152/16, 185/3, 4, 203/1, 273/8, 297/4, 313/25, 381/24, 388/2.</P>
</DIV3><DIV3 TYPE="theme"  ID="DIV3.56" ><HEAD>&sect; 40. Noun Clauses.</HEAD>
<P>(A.) The Subject Clause, which, in Modern English, is introduced
by that, turns up very frequently in the shape of an Accusative in
connection with an Infinitive.  'It is better a man wysely to be
stille, than folysshly to speke,' <HI REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI>, 93/5.  See &sect; 30.</P>
<P>(B.) Much more interesting is the difference in the construction
of the Object Clause.  Compare the following two sentences: 'And
God saw the light that it was good' (<HI REND="i">Genesis</HI>, i. 4); 'You see that I
am composed' (Dickens, <HI REND="i">Dombey and Son</HI>, iii. 9).</P>
<P>Logically speaking, the two constructions are equivalent; but
psychologically, how different is the idea which they represent!  In
the first case the sentence expresses an abstract result; in the second,
the verb see has a concrete object, in which a certain attribute is
perceived.</P>
<P>The former way of expression is the older as well as the more
intuitive, and it crops up very often in Early English, though the
more modern one seems to have crept in at a very early period:&mdash;</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>Old English:</LABEL>  Ic &thorn;&oelig;t gehre, &thorn;&oelig;t &thorn;is is hold w&euml;orod, <HI

<P>(C.) Whenever the object noun-clause is at the same time an
adjectival one, Caxton uses the old construction.  Take for instance
this sentence, 'He saw a shield that he knew to be his brother's.'
Instead of using our accusative with the infinitive, Caxton says (as
we also often do now): 'He saw a shield that he knew was his
brother's':&mdash;</P>

<P>Compared with Early English, the inversion of the present

is very near the Modern English; in two cases, however, he has kept
the Middle English.</P>
<P>1. Inversion used in emphatic sentences:&mdash;</P>

<P>2. Co-ordinate sentences introduced by and are often inverted.
This use may be traced to the pre-historic time of the English
language.  It appears in the oldest Teutonic dialects, and is still
kept in Modern German, though learned grammarians are untiring
in ridiculing this time-honoured use:&mdash;</P>

<P>(B.) The personal pronoun as an object is not bound by this
rule.  In Old English its place was generally before the finite verb,
as may be seen from the <HI REND="i">Blickling Homilies</HI>, where more than 80 per
cent. of the pronouns in the oblique case precede the verb.  In Middle
English prose the modern arrangement carries the day, and in Caxton
there are but a small number of instances exhibiting the old use; but
even in these the French influence may have been of some effect:&mdash;</P>

<P>(A.) One attribute.</P>
<P>In Old and Middle English, adjectives (as a rule) precede the
noun; this before-putting, though not unfrequent in poetry, occurs
rarely in prose.  In Caxton, adjectives&mdash;not only of French, but also
of Teutonic origin, as well as present and past participles&mdash;follow the
noun, and we may safely say that this is due to French influence.</P>
<P>(B.) Of two adjectives belonging to the same noun, the first precedes,
the second follows it.  This is nearly like the French use; but
Caxton was far from copying his original, he simply kept a very old
good English tradition:&mdash;</P>

<P>To sum up:&mdash;Caxton's syntax, on the whole, is nearer Chaucer
than Shakspere; and there is a still greater kinship between his
prose and that of the fourteenth century, than that of the Elizabethan
age.  In reading Caxton's books, the general impression resembles
very much that received by reading <HI REND="i">The Tale of Melibeus</HI>, or even
<HI REND="i">Maundeville</HI>; and the results of a minute analysis agrees with that
impression.  It is true, many peculiarities of Caxton's language turn
up also in Shakspere and Spenser; but we must keep in mind, that
there is always a sort of tradition in poetry, which links together the
remotest periods, while in simple prose, as in daily life, the distance
of times is of great influence.  There is a wide gap between the
language in Spenser's <HI REND="i">Fa&euml;rie Queene</HI>, not to speak of the <HI
REND="i">Shepherd's
Calendar</HI>, and his <HI REND="i">View of the State of Ireland</HI>.</P>
<P>Thus, the plural of abstracts is very frequent in the poem, but
very rare in the prose treatise; the article is extremely often omitted
in the former, while it is used in the latter, etc.</P>
<P>There are several points, which draw a very marked line between
Caxton's syntax and that of the sixteenth century:&mdash;</P>
<LIST><ITEM><P>1. Ye, not you, is still, with a few exceptions, the nominative of
the 2nd pers. plural personal pronoun.  This is quite common in
Berners.  See p. xiii.

between transitive and intransitive verbs, with regard to the passive

<DIV3 TYPE="section"  ID="DIV3.68" ><HEAD>I. CAXTON AS A TRANSLATOR.  HIS STYLE.</HEAD>
<P>'IN his translation of this work, Caxton shows himself piously
literal.  Words and phrases, both foreign and unusual, he transferred
bodily to his text; nothing ever deterred him, simply because it was
French; he wandered along every winding of the sentences he was
rendering, and brought them over with all their sinuosities into
English.  In consequence, his translation is perhaps one of the most
literal that has ever been produced in the English language; and
though to some extent stilted and even awkward, yet it is impossible
not to admire his faithfulness to his original; and the very quaintness
of those peculiarities of language sometimes adds a charm to his
composition.'&mdash;Octavia Richardson, in the Introduction to her edition
of <HI REND="i">The Four Sonnes of Aymon</HI>, E. E. T. Soc., p. vii.</P>
<pb N="cxi"  ID="pb.112" ><P>I don't think Caxton was such a pious slave.  His translation of
<HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>, no doubt, is as 'quaint' and even as 'awkward' as
that of <HI REND="i">The Four Sonnes of Aymon</HI>; but I cannot admit Miss Octavia
Richardson's statement with regard to his 'piety.'  On the other
hand, I contend that he was as good and free a translator as any
of the 15th century, and in his style certainly not inferior to Peacock,
the greatest prosaist of his time.</P>
<P>What makes Caxton's style appear so awkward in the eyes of a
modern reader, is his repetitions, tautologies, and anacolutha.  But
these irregularities are, for the most part, conscious sins, committed
not only by him, but also by all the writers of his time.  Read the
following sentences from Malory, whose like never occurs in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>
or <HI REND="i">Aymon</HI>, and you will admit that Caxton was a very able
translator, for his time:&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, saide Merlyn / I knowe whome thou sekest / for thou sekest

<P>Of course, Caxton followed the drift of the narrative in his
original as closely as possible; but so far as I am aware, there is no
ground whatever for supposing that he slavishly sacrificed the genius
of his native language to Latin or French.  It will be seen by the
Introduction that Caxton's Syntax is essentially English, as much so
as that of Chaucer and Gower; his arrangement of words is, in spite
of his original, truly Saxon; and even in his introduction of foreign
words, he only continued what the preceding centuries had begun.</P>
<P>There are a very few decided Frenchisms in <HI REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI>; but
these are rather slips of the pen, than intended or conscious innovations.
Such are require, demand, governing the dative case, see &sect; 6,
p. xxiii; swear, with the accusative, see &sect; 7, p. xxiv, A; the article
used in the vocative case, &sect; 7, a; the his, &sect; 7, b, p. xxvi.  Cf. Dr.
Furnivall, Introduction to <HI REND="i">Eneydos</HI>, p. xix.</P>
<P>As strong evidence against Miss Richardson's opinion, I quote
the fact that there is not one instance of the French <FOREIGN LANG="fre">moi</FOREIGN> = I being
translated by 'me'!  See &sect; 4, p. xi.  With regard to Caxton's
style, its main feature is the tiresome tautology, which is apparently
produced by the translator's desire to make as much as he could of
his work, to render it as showy as possible;<note ID="note.31" >Compare the American girl who liked creaky shoes because they announced her coming and made folk look at her.</NOTE> his whole age was
affected by this fashion of intolerable verbosity: to convey an idea
through the medium of as many words as possible was considered as
a beauty of style.</P>
<P>This appears first in the choice of words.  Generally, one French
expression is rendered by two consecutive synonyms; sometimes the
first of these is the word of the original, sometimes another; sometimes
one is French, the other Saxon; sometimes one strange, the other
familiar:&mdash;</P>

<P>A second sort of tautology is Caxton's additions of his own, for
which there is not the slightest necessity whatever.  (But who of us
doesn't like touching up other men's work?)  Compare the following
instances, to which many more can be added:&mdash;</P>

63/12, 64/6, 65/34, etc.</P>
<P>There are very few passages in which Caxton is less verbose
than the original.  Cf. 24/16, 44/6, 65/16.</P>
<P>There are also few instances in which Caxton seems to have
misinterpreted the French:&mdash;</P>

le droit que tu y pretendez a auoir</FOREIGN>), 27/15, 16.  Cf. 29/1.</P>
<P>The sudden transition from one construction to another is pretty
frequent in Caxton, and seems, to a certain degree, to have been
considered as a figure of speech.  Compare the following passages:&mdash;</P>
<P>For I confesse me not lerned, ne knowynge the arte of rhetorik,

<P>Against the first important principle of modern composition, the
unity of sentence, Caxton often sins.  Such strong anacolutha as the

in about 4800 octosyllabic lines.  French.  'Blanchandin is the son
of a king of "Frise" (Phrygia?).  He has been kept in ignorance of
chivalry, till he sees some figures upon a tapestry.  He steals away
from home, and, after a &slong;ew adventures, kisses Orgueillose d'Amors,
the Princess of Tormadai (apparently in or near Syria), out of sheer
bravado.  Her indignation is before long changed into affection.
She is besieged by another suitor.  Blanchandin is taken prisoner.
He is shipwrecked on the coast of India.  In the end he returns to
Tormadai with Indian allies under a Prince Sadoine, and they relieve
Orgueillose d'Amors.'</P>
<P>M. Michelant thus sketches the contents of the earliest version
of the story in the St. Germain MS. 1239, of the 13th century,
which contains 4,826 lines (p. v&mdash;vii):&mdash;</P>
<P>'Blancandin has fled from his Father's court&mdash;where the practice
of arms was forbidden him&mdash;to seek adventures abroad.  On his road,
a knight advises him to go and kiss, in the midst of her retinue, the
beauteous <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Orgueilleuse d'amour</FOREIGN>, whose name denotes her character.
This audacious deed stirs most highly the wrath of the young
princess.  She vows she will take astounding vengeance on the
culprit, who has fled.  She recognises him next day in the middle of
a tourney where he carries off the prize; but the valour and good
looks of the young knight make love supplant hatred in her heart;
and the two lovers have just avowed their mutual feelings, when an
old Saracen king (Alimodes) arrives, who besieges <FOREIGN LANG="fre">l'Orgueilleuse
d'amour</FOREIGN>, to force her to marry him, in spite of her repeated refusals.
Blancandin offers to defend her, and distinguishes himself in the
fight; but, overpowered by numbers, is taken prisoner.  In vain is
the highest ransom offered to the Saracen king.  He has sworn the
death of his rival, and sends him captive to a King of the Indies,
whose brother, Blancandin had slain in battle.</P>
<P>'During the voyage, a storm rises, which wrecks the vessel, and
Blancandin alone escapes.  He arrives safe and sound at the court of
a certain King of Athens, who is besieged by a powerful enemy.
Blancandin offers his services to the King, and frees him.  The King,
from gratitude, wishes to marry Blancandin [to his daughter?], but
Blancandin, faithful to 'the Lady-proud-in-love,' refuses.  He con&slong;ides
his secret to the King's son (Sadoine), with whom he is bound
in firm friendship, and both embark to succour the still-besieged
Princess.  At sea, they meet some of her folk; and Blancandin, without
making himself known, charges them to announce his speedy
arrival, for the purpose of delivering her.  But, in very sight of the
harbour, a tempest drives them away, and Blancandin takes advantage
of the terror of his companions, to convert and baptise them.  He
lands, with his friend Sadoine, in the very kingdom of the Prince
<pb N="cxviii"  ID="pb.119" >
(Alimodes) who was besieging the Lady-proud-in-love, where his own
Father was moaning in the direst captivity.  Blancandin promises to
give Sadoine in marriage the daughter of King Alimodes, a young
and beautiful Saraceness who, in the customary way, at first sight
falls in love with the Knight (Sadoine), whom she sees out hunting.
Blancandin takes the city, kills the King's son Darie, gives his sister
in marriage to his friend Sadoine, and sets his own father free.  Then
all retake the road to Tormaday, where the Lady-proud-in-love is
besieged.  She sends her Provost to know who the new-comers are,
and to ask them for help.  The Provost&mdash;who had formerly been
Blancandin's host&mdash;recognises him, and announces his arrival to the
Lady-proud.  She wants to prepare a brilliant reception for him,
while his foe Alimodes, on his side, makes ready for battle.  In the
middle of the fight, the Lady-proud, to encourage Blancandin, sends
him her sleeve on the point of a spear; he redoubles his efforts, and
puts his rival to flight.  Alimodes re-embarks in all haste.  And
the two lovers, united at last, after so many thwartings, celebrate
their marriage; and the wedding ended, every one, says the poet in
concluding, goes home, <Q><FOREIGN LANG="fre">S'en vet en sa contr&eacute;e.'</FOREIGN></Q></P><P>The end of the text is&mdash;<HI

<pb N="cxix"  ID="pb.120" ><P>The story of the later addition to the first version of the Romance
is thus told by M. Michelant on pages viii, ix, of his edition:&mdash;</P>
<P>'In the fight which ended in raising the siege of Tormadai,
Sadoine, who had slain the brother of Alimodes, was taken prisoner
by the latter, and sent to Cassidonie [Chalcedony], to be there put to
death.  Blancandin sets out to succour his friend, and delivers him
at the moment he was to be strung up on a gallows, notwithstanding
the prayers of the daughter of Alimodes, who begged in vain for
pardon for her spouse.  Alimodes is conquered again.  But, during
the absence of Blancandin, his Seneschal&mdash;in whose guard he had
left the Lady-proud-in-love&mdash;gets together the chief Lords of the
country, and plots with them to carry off at once both the Crown
and Love of Blancandin, that he, the Seneschal, may force her to
marry him.  Two vassals who remain faithful, conduct Orgueilleuse
to a castle, where the treacherous Seneschal besieges them.  They,
however, find means to warn Blancandin, who hastens to return to
Tormadai to revenge himself.  The traitor flees,&mdash;pursued closely by
Blancandin and his friend Sadoine,&mdash;and takes refuge at a neighbouring
brigand's, where he hopes to get rid of the two knights who
have isolated themselves in the ardour of their pursuit.  They, though
received with apparent good-will, suspect a snare; they persist in
keeping their arms, in spite of the most pressing invitations to give
them up; and, seizing on a favourable moment, they cut to pieces
the band of robbers, and carry off their leader and the Seneschal,
whom they punish with death.  After this exploit, Blancandin
returns to Tormadai, where he celebrates his nuptials and those of
his friend Sadoine, with the greatest magnificence.'</P>
<P>Such, says M. Michelant, is the new ending of the poem in the
MSS. of Turin and the French National Library, 375.  The differences
of it in these MSS. consist only in this, that in the Turin MS.
the episode of the amours of Sadoine with the daughter of Alimodes,
the first interview of the two lovers, and the combats which precede
the taking of Cassidonie are treated at greater length, and with details
which are not found in the other version.<note ID="note.33" >Does not this point to the Turin version being the later of the two?</NOTE></P>
<P>The chapter-headings do not agree, word for word, with Caxton's.
They divide the Story into 3 Parts, and differ in expression, as the
englishing of a few below will show:&mdash;</P>
<P>This present book contains 3 Treatises, of which the First
speaks of the birth of Blanchendin; how he set out from the court
(ostel) of his Father, and why; how he became a knight, and how
he kissed <FOREIGN LANG="fre">l'Orgueilleuse d'amours</FOREIGN>: the which first Treatise is divided

<pb N="cxx"  ID="pb.121" >
into 10 Chapters, of which the First tells of the birth of Blanchendin,
of the joy which sprang from it, and how he was put to study as
soon as he was of fit age (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">eut aage</FOREIGN>), and how he got on (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">profita</FOREIGN>).</P>
<P>The 2nd Chapter tells how, on the information (relacion) of his
Master, and also because of his own inclination, his departure is
settled (l. 125 of the Verse-text).&hellip;</P>
<P>The 10th Chapter tells in what manner Blanchendin managed
to kiss (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">parvint au baisier de</FOREIGN>) the Proud-Lady-of-Love, and of the
displeasure that she took at it (ab. line 687 of the Verse-text).</P>
<P>The Second Treatise tells how Blanchendin came to Tourmaday,
and how he fought his Host; how and by what means he recovered
the good-will of the Proud-Lady-of-Love, and of the imprisonment
of the above-named; and contains 16 Chapters, of which the First
tells of the sharp grief that the Proud-Lady-of-Love made on account
of the aforesaid kiss; of the arguments between her, and her mistress
who comforted her (ab. line 710 of the Verse-text).</P>
<P>The 2nd Chapter speaks of the threats of the Lady-Proud-in-Love
to Blanchendin, and how Blanchendin came to Tourmaday to lodge;
of the Provost, and the verses which he found on the Provost's door
(line 781 of the Verse-text).&hellip;</P>
<P>The 16th Chapter tells how Blanchendin slew the King of the
Giants; how Blanchendin was captured; of the grief which the
Lady-Proud-in-Love made thereat; how she sent the Provost to
(<FOREIGN LANG="fre">devers</FOREIGN>) Allimodes for the ransom of Blanchendin; and of the
refusal of Allimodes, and how he had Blanchendin shipt off (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">fist
enmener</FOREIGN>) by sea (line 1903 of the Verse-text).</P>
<P>The Third Treatise tells how Blanchendin behaved himself (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">se
gouverna</FOREIGN>) at Athens towards the King; of his return; of the conquest
of Cassidonie; how he recognized his Father; of the victory that he
won against Allimodes and against the traitor Subiien; and is
divided into 22<note ID="note.34" >Michelant prints xii., but gives headings of xxij.</NOTE> Chapters, of which the First says that Allimodes
had Blanchendin shipt off; and how, by chance, he (Blanchendin)
was saved from the dangers of the sea, and pretended to be a
Saracen (line 2119 of the Verse-text).</P>
<P>The 2nd Chapter tells how Blanchendin was retained by the
King of Athens, and brought to good end (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">lui acheva</FOREIGN>) a war that
he had in hand (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">auoit</FOREIGN>).  (line 2285 of the Verse-text).&hellip;</P>
<P>The 22nd Chapter tells how Subien thought to save himself;
and the way he was taken, and then hanged (line 5954 of the Verse-text).</P>
<P>We evidently want an edition of the Brussels MS., to show its
full differences from Caxton's original.</P>
<P>As to Blanchardyn pretending to be a Saracen, the Verse-text
says (p. 75) that after escaping to land from the shipwreck,</P><pb N="cxxi"  ID="pb.122" >

whole drift of the narrative, both texts agree; there are but very
slight differences, pointed out in the footnotes, which may be either
due to the MS. which Caxton had before him, or, what is much
more probable, to the translator's system of touching-up his original.</P>

REND="i">Life of Caxton</HI>, ii. 216-7 (1863.)</BIBL></P><P>Of the edition of 1595&mdash;of which Mr. Christie-Miller has the
only copy&mdash;there are, in the present edition, two long specimens
under Caxton's text.  Part I. of ed. 1597 is at Hamburg.</P></Q><P>The shortest, and therefore the most ancient, version of <HI
REND="i">Blanchardyn
and Eglantyne</HI> is that contained in the MS. 19,152 of the
National Library at Paris.  In it the poet is kind enough to marry
both Blanchardyn and Sadoyne after their return from Cassidonie,
where they have killed Darie, the son of Alymodes, and conquered
the entire kingdom.  The whole story answers to Caxton's chapters
1&mdash;42, and half of 43.</P>
<P>The Paris MS. 375, and that at Turin, add the taking of Sadoyne
in the Castle, Blanchardyn's setting out in order to save him and
the treason of Subion, as related by Caxton in chapters 43&mdash;56.</P>
<P>Thus far the report of M. Michelant, in his edition of <HI REND="i">Blancandin
et L'Orgueilleuse d'Amour</HI> (Paris, Librairie Tross, 1867), is right.
But with regard to the prose versions he commits a very gross
mistake.  He believes the two only extant prose versions to be one
and the same.  After having given a description of the Brussels
MS. he, referring to a short note dedicated to an unknown gentleman,
says:&mdash;</P>
<P><FOREIGN LANG="fre">'Nous crayons qu'il est ici question du Duc de Bourgogne,
Philippe le Bel, qui &agrave; fait faire bon nombre de ces translations,
notamment celles de Siperis, d'H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, d'Eric et Enite, que l'on
trouve dans la m&ecirc;me biblioth&egrave;que, bien que le second exemplaire de
cette translation semble infirmer notre hypoth&egrave;se.  Ce dernier fait
partie du fonds de Sorbonne No. 466, petit in-folio sur papier, aux
armes de Richelieu, de cent cinq feuillets &agrave; longues lignes, d'une
&eacute;criture du xve si&egrave;cle, qui para&icirc;t post&eacute;rieure &agrave; l'autre MS. La table
dont la premi&egrave;re manque, contient en tout 54 chapitres sans division
de livres; elle diff&egrave;re de la pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente bien que roman offre le m&ecirc;me
texte.'</FOREIGN></P>
<P>I really cannot conceive how the editor could venture to put
forward such a fallacy.  The prose MS. of the Brussels Library has
<pb N="cxxv"  ID="pb.126" >
not the least connection with that of Paris.  They are quite independent
of each other, and differ not only in the Tables of Contents,
but also in the text.  The Brussels MS. is a brief abstract of the
story,&mdash;as Michelant might have seen by the small number of leaves,
&mdash;while the Paris prose version is a full rendering of the romance.
Besides this, the former agrees with the poetic version as printed by
M. Michelant, in every name, while the latter, or Paris MS., exhibits
a most important alteration in the names of persons and places.</P>
<P>In the Brussels MS., as well as in Michelant's edition, Blanchardyn
kills Rubion, the '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">roy des Gaians</FOREIGN>,' and is sent by Alymodes
to Salmandrie.  During a storm he escapes, and comes to the shore
of Athens.  He presents himself to the king Ruban, who makes him
'senechal' of his army, against his enemy <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Escamor de Beaudaire</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>This is quite different in the Paris MS., in which Blanchardyn
is cast on the shore of Prussia, and comes to Marienburg.  The
king of Prussia is pleased with him, and appoints him (Blanchardyn)
head-captain of his army.  Meanwhile a wounded knight
arrives with the news that the king of Poland has invaded Prussia.
Blanchardyn, with Sadoyne, is sent against the Poles, and Blanchardyn
unhorses the king, who gives himself up as a prisoner.</P>
<P>What induced the author of the Paris prose version to alter
Athens into Marienburg?  Probably he wanted a country better
known to the people of that time as a scene of constant war, and in
this respect his choice was very well made.  After the Crusades to
the Holy Sepulchre had lost their charms, the knights of England
and France very often joined their colleagues of the Teutonic order,
who were in a state of constant warfare with their heathen neighbours
in Lettow (Lithuania), Ruce (Russia), and elsewbere.  Compare
Chaucer's description of the Knight:&mdash;</P><P><Q><l  ID="l.480" >'At Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne;</L><l  ID="l.481" >Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bygonne,</L><l  ID="l.482" >Abouen alle naciouns in Pruce.</L><l  ID="l.483" >In Lettowe hadde he reysed, and in Ruce,</L><l  ID="l.484" >No cristen man so ofte of his degre.</L></Q><BIBL>&mdash;<HI

<P>Blanchardine, hauing rode all the night, and finding both
him &slong;elfe and his hor&slong;e begin to be wearie, and not any
aduenture woorthy recounting, traueling thorough a large
forre&slong;t by many bye-paths (for feare of e&slong;pialls), chaunced
at la&slong;t to finde a man armed, lying groueling on the ground, all
imbrued in his owne gore, being by a knight mo&slong;te cowardly encountred;
who not only had bemangled his limbes, but al&slong;o bereft
him of his looue and Mi&slong;tre&slong;&slong;e, which he had carried away <MILESTONE
N="B, back" UNIT="sign.">perforce.
when Blanchardine beheld this mo&slong;te heauie &slong;pectacle, allighting
from his hor&slong;e, comforting the di&slong;maid knight, holpe to binde vp his
bleeding wounds, & withall inquiring of him ye cau&slong;e of his mi&slong;hap,
<pb N="23"  ID="pb.181" >
& the man that &slong;o inhumainlike had left him in this di&slong;tre&slong;&slong;e.  hee
an&slong;wered: "braue young Lord, I trauelling along the&slong;e plaines,
tending my iorney to my hou&slong;e, di&slong;tant from hence not pa&slong;t two
leagues, was on the &slong;uddain encountred by a vilain, who not only
hath left me mangled and wounded as you &slong;ee, but al&slong;o hath caried
by force from me my wife, who&slong;e ab&slong;ence will be the pre&slong;ent cau&slong;e of
my death, and who&slong;e daunger brings greater &slong;orrow to my heart then
all the&slong;e woundes which I endure."</P>
<P>'Why,' quoth Blanchardine, 'how long &slong;ince departed hee hence,
and left you thus di&slong;tre&slong;&slong;ed?' the wounded Knight replyed: "&slong;carce
half an houre agoe, he tooke his way towards yonder wood, and
<pb N="24"  ID="pb.182" >
caried my looue with him."  then replyed Blanchardine: 'I neuer
yet until this day haue vndertaken armes; but let mee reque&slong;t you
to honor me with the order of knight-hood, and I will pawne my life
to dye, or to recouer againe your looue.'  Then &slong;aid the wounded
man: "I will not only make you knight, but withall (if you plea&slong;e)
arme you with this my armour and launce, that &slong;hall adde more
&slong;trength to your courage; and be&slong;ides, I will exorate the Gods to
&slong;end you all happines, not only in this, but in all other your honorable
attemptes."</P>
<P>'Sir,' quoth Blanchardine, 'I thinke me &slong;ufficiently honored by
this your offer; therfore di&slong;arme your &slong;elfe &slong;peedily, that he may not
be pa&slong;t recouerie, before I ouertake him.'  So the wounded Knight
armed him, and inve&slong;ted him with the order of Knighthood.  when
Blanchardine &slong;aw him&slong;elfe thus arraied, his youthly courage prickt
him on; who, taking his hor&slong;e, mounted the Saddle, wher brauely
managing him vpon the plaine, to proue how well he could rule his
Launce, found him&slong;elfe (as he thought) fit for this enterprize.  And
<pb N="25"  ID="pb.183" >
&slong;o, with valiant courage and cheerefull countenance, hee tooke his
leaue of the w[ou]nded Knight, and po&slong;ted after the other, that had
carried away his wife.  He had not ridden long, but he perceiued the
tracktes & foot&slong;teps of a hor&slong;e, that had lately gon that way; and,
following tho&slong;e &slong;teps with a &slong;peedy pace, he heard the pittifull complaint
that a <MILESTONE N="B 2" UNIT="sign.">Lady made, to appea&slong;e the raging lu&slong;t of a villaine, who
&slong;ought perforce to raui&slong;h her: whom pre&slong;ently hee found, hid vnder
the &slong;hadow of a leafye tree, beating ye poore di&slong;tre&slong;&slong;ed Lady, the wife
<pb N="26"  ID="pb.184" >
of the wounded knight.  to whom, making &slong;peedy approch, 'va&slong;&slong;ail,
(quoth he), de&slong;i&slong;t from this cruell and damnable enterprize! for I
&slong;weare by heauen, I will make thee repent this ab&slong;urd vilany.'</P>
<P>The Knight, feeing Blanchardine to be young, & greatly greeued
for his &slong;odaine approch, made &slong;emblance of much wrath; but Blanchardine,
with au&slong;tere countenance & Princely voice, commaunded him
pre&slong;ently to free the Lady, whom mo&slong;t wrongfully he had caried
away from her hu&slong;band, whom hee left almo&slong;t ready to yeeld vp the

<P>The knight, di&slong;daining to be &slong;o vpbraid by &slong;o yong a knight,
be&slong;tirred him&slong;elfe pre&slong;ently, and made him ready to the fight.  But

(withall) commaunded Blanchardine to de&slong;i&slong;t from his enterprize
and leaue him to his plea&slong;ure, (or if not) it &slong;hould co&slong;t him his life.</P>
<P>Blanchardine, not able to endure the&slong;e cruell menaces, willed
him to addre&slong;&slong;e him to the combat quickly, or he would send him,

<P>The&slong;e braue caualiers, being mounted, encountred ech

the ayre; & each of them, admiring the valure of his
foe, and finding their launces broken, they betooke
them &slong;elues to their &slong;words.  long remained the fight
doubtfull, till Blanchardine, remembring the equitie of his quarrell,
and the honor he &slong;hould atchiue by this conque&slong;t, with all the agillity
and &slong;trength hee could, (mounting him&slong;elfe on his &slong;tirrops), &slong;o
feircely a&slong;&slong;ailed his foe, that vnnayling his armor and vnlacing his

Then Blanchardine, &slong;euering the head of the &slong;laine traitorous Knight

on the Knights hor&slong;e, and po&slong;ted towards the wounded knight.  but
on the way, &slong;hee demaunded of Blanchardine in what &slong;tate he had

wounded, yet was he liuing.  'alas! (quoth &slong;he), let vs po&slong;t to

How be it, he felt the contrary at his herte / They
cam to &thorn;e ladyes palays, and went thourgh &thorn;e grete

was there comyng, men made them to entre in to the
chambre of parement, wher as the right gracyouse and
fayre, the proude pucelle in amours, was wyth many of
her ladyes, and other her gentyll women / and spake at
that same owre wyth certayne of her counseyll vpon

entred in to the chambre; and thenne, as blanchardyn<pb N="77"  ID="pb.245" >
sawe & perceyued &thorn;e noble pucelle, he dyde vaunce
him self toward her, & make vnto her the reuerence so

coude amende it; and consequently to all the lordes,
ladyes, and gentyl women, so goodely & wel that euery
one saide good of hym.  &thorn;e noble mayden behelde hym
moche humbly, whiche toke a right grete pleasure to
see his gracyouse & assured behauyng, that tysed and
doubled in her herte the fyre of loue, wherof she was
sore esprysed / And thenne, after the fayre and swete
welcomynges, the lady wythdrewe her toward a couche
that was in the sayd chambre, & toke blanchardyn by
the hande, and made hym to sytte besyde her.  He
made hym self to be prayed & drawen sore or euer he
wolde vaunce hym self for to sytte hym doune by her.
But force was to hym to obeye her commaundement,
wherof al they that thenne were wythin the chambre
coude not tourne their eyen from Blanchardyn, for his
right grete beaulte, fayre behauoure, & good manyere.
And she to whome the dede most touched, had grete
Ioye at her herte / to fynde her self in the presence of

<ADD>and taken<note ID="note.236" >Wanting in the French.</NOTE></ADD> wyth the brennyng fyre of loue, that she
not coude kepe her contenaunce; & yf rayson had not

she sholde haue gladly of pryme face tolde vnto
blanchardyn, how loue constrayned her for <CORR SIC="to">the</CORR> loue of
hym.  And at ende of a while, the best wyse that she
coude, Wyth a lowe voyce she sayde vnto blanchardyn:
'Syre, ye knowe the werre that the vntrewe kynge
Alymodes hath alredy don to me dyuerse tymes, Wherfore
I mystered gretly of thayde and socours of you

conforte me in my said werre, & I shal rewarde you so

'I ensure you on my feyth, that in all that I shal
mowe, I shal employe me in your seruyce: I wyll not
spare my self.  I am come out of myn owne contrey

And thanked be god, I am here right well arryued: I

the pucell, 'I promette you that youre hoste shalbe
al to gydre contented of you / and alle of myn owne' /
And after thees wordes she dyde cast a profound syghe,
that proceded from the depnes of her herte, that sore
was pressed / She was so ouer perced and enflammed

tourned to his lawe, the more ought she afterward,
whan she is ouercome, to be more constant & stedfast
to kepe hit.  This experyence was playnly shewed in
this lady.  Blanchardyn trowed to perceyue a lytyl her
manere, and remembred hym self of the wordes that his
hooste had tolde hym the same daye, And syth sayde
to &thorn;e lady: 'Madame, myn hoste hath tolde me this
daye that ye knowe well my lady paramours, and that
she is of your lynage. by my &slong;eyth, this thynge semeth
me right straunge.'  Thenne the proude pucelle in
amours byganne to ansuere, and sayde / 'The lady of

blanchardyn, 'pardoune me yf I desyre by manere

cutte bothe fleshe and bone, and made in his body a

sore abasshed whan they sawe their lorde that laye

merueylles of armes / they brake and cutte Cassydonyens
on all sydes.  No man was there so hardy
that durste approche hem, where al as they came they
made &thorn;e presse to sprede abrode / Blanchardyn dyde
espye a knyght that bare the standarde of the cassydonyens

an horryble stroke vpon his helme that he all tobrayned
hym wyth his swerde.  And thus he ouerthrewe
doune bothe man & standarde, so that the
Cassydonyens had not syth the powere for to haue
dressyd it vp ayen, but were slayne and all to-cutte and
clouen, that all the wayes were couered of bodyes ded

for certayne that Impossyble was to her for to kepe the

moost worthy knyghtes of the lande were wyth her
fader, the kynge Alymodes, at the siege by fore
Tourmaday / and that suche as were yssued out there
were almost all ouer throwen / Wel saw &thorn;e fayre
Beatryx that she muste yelde vp her self.  The same
tyme passed Sadoyne by-fore the wyndowe, that wyth
bothe handes smote vpon his enmyes / The fayre
Beatryx called hym, sayng in this manere: 'Alas,
right noble knyght, I gyue my self vnto you / prayeng
that ye wol saue bothe me and my cyte, And to take

Sadoyne, lokyng toward the wyndow, heued right
soone his hand vpward and sayde, & promysed her
that he sholde warauntyse her from all harme; he was
right glad of these tydynges.  It was not longe after
this that blanchardyn and Sadoyne dyde mete to

founde the fayer Beatryx, that cam ayenst them &
yelded herself to them, prayng that they wold haue
pyte vpon her.  Blanchardyn toke the mayden by the
hande, sayng to her: 'ffayer damesel, god forbede that
euyl nor harme sholde be don to you!' he cam toward
sadoyn, & sayd vnto hym / 'My ryght trusty felawe /

(euen then) was come to the Castell with many prisoners
and rich booties of the rebels, she demaunded where
Blanchardine and Sadony were.  'Madam,' answered
the old Earle, 'it is not long since they were both heere
in our companie, and we supposed that they had bene
alreadie entered the Castell before our comming.' When
the faire Queene perceiued that no tidings could be
heard of them, fearing some mischaunce, she fell into a
sounde, wherin she continued the space of an houre
and more; but being recouered, she began most pitteously
to weepe and exclaime against fortune: the old
Earle and the Countesse recomforted her as well as they
could, but nothing could sort to her content. then they
laid her on a sumptious bed, hoping by sleepe to make
her forget sorowe; but neither sleepe nor quiet could
harber in her head, fearing least Blanchardine were
<pb N="208"  ID="pb.379" >

the murtherers and fettred Subbion, they mounted vpon
their horses, and tied Sub-<MILESTONE N="I 2" UNIT="sign.">bion with cordes fast to the
back of an other horse which they found there; and
by the light of the Moone, tooke their way to Castelford,
which was distance thence foure miles; Sadony
leading the way, Subbion in the middest, and Blanchardine
the hindmost.  They posted so fast, that within
short time they came before the gate of the Castell,
where they allighted from their horses; then knocking
at the gates, they were presently knowne, and with
all speed let in, leading Subbion betweene them.  the
newes being brought to y<HI REND="sup">e</HI> Queene, her melancholy was
turned to mirth, her sorrow to sollace, and her weeping
to laughter.  Blanchardine commaunded that Subbion
should be imprisoned in the most obscure dungion
within the Castell, and that himselfe would become his
Iaylor.  After which he assended vp into the Queenes
chamber, whom he found new risen, raised by this
happy news, at whose entrance her spirits began to be
<pb N="209"  ID="pb.380" >
recomforted.  and after many kisses and sweet imbracements
they sate downe, and spent the night in discoursing
of their aduentures past.</P>
<P>But when the day began to peepe, they tooke their
horses and rode to Tormaday, against whome (in all
kind manner) came the aged king of Frize, who for a
while had rested himself there, accompanied with all
the noble Knights and Burgises of Tormaday: the
walles were hanged with tapestry, the streets were
strewed with rushes and sweet smelling roses, to gratulate
their comming; the matrons compiling garlands of
sundry flowers, the Ladyes dauncing, the damsels singing,
the musicke sounding a sweet concordance to their
entrie.  Thus in tryumph they assended the princely
pallace, most sumpteously adorned with rich cloth of
golde, embost with pearle and stone, where, by the
whole aduice and generall consent of all, they were
affiaunced.</P>
<pb N="210"  ID="pb.381" ><P>The neighboring Princes, which long had bent their
deuotions to <CORR SIC="thee">the</CORR> sweet Saint which kept her shrine
in Tormaday (I meane the faire and chast Lady Eglantine,
surnamed the proude Lady in loue), hauing receiued
notice by their espialls, which kept continuall residence
within the Citty of Tormaday, to certifie the newes
which happened there, to their Princes and Counsels,
hearing (I say) that this Queene, whose obstinacie
a-<MILESTONE N="I 2, back" UNIT="sign."><note RESP="kc" ID="note.460" >Kellner inserted a note marker here without a note; presumably, he intended to insert the missing milestone which we have provided.</NOTE>gainst Cupid was incomparable, and peeuish conceit
in loue most absurd, had nowe entred the chapter
house of his mother Venus, being limed in the bush of
Blanchardines beauty, whose large commendations and
magnanimious corage was caryed by the swift winges
of flying fame throughout many Realmes and prouinces,
the like before was sildome or neuer heard.  These kings
(I say) whose fancies before that time had receiued the
perfect impression of loue in the Angellike beautie of
that Princely Queene, whose amber lockes trust vp in
golden trammels, was a sufficient addamant to draw
all Iron hearts vnto her, now seeing all hope of her
recouerie past, and their desires frustrate, with franke
and friendly consent, not only come to visit and veiw
Blanchardine, but also brought such honorable presentes
and Kingly Iuels to welcome him to Tormaday, and
to congratulate the happie mariage betweene him and
the faire Princesse Eglantine, as their Countries and
kingdomes did afford.  Some presented him with
stately coursers and Iennets of seruice, some with ships
of huge and mightie burthen, some with Pearles and
Iuels of inestimable valure.  And to be short, euery
one, though at first his foe and vtter enemie, yet in
time veiwing his maiesticall and princely corage, became
his true and faithful freends, esteeming him worthy of
greater honor than either their personages, presents, or
the obtaining of the beautifull Queene of Tormaday
could afford.</P><pb N="211"  ID="pb.382" >
<P>And on the next morning, the beautifull Queene
was royally led to and from the Church (where she
was espoused to Blanchardine) by two Kings, Sadony
and the king of Frize: and the same day crowned
King and Queene of Tormaday, to the exceeding comfort
of all their subiectes and friendes.  After their
returne from the Church to the Court, they were
feasted with all possible cheere that could bee deuised:
and after dinner the Trumpets sounded to the Iustes
and tiltings vntill supper.  And after supper, maskes,
playes, and Princely deuises, spent the time till they
went to bed.</P>
<P>On the morrow the feast began a-fresh, and continued
for the space of twentie daies.  After all which
<pb N="212"  ID="pb.383" >
arroyalties were finysh-<MILESTONE N="I 3" UNIT="sign.">ed by the commandement of
Blanchardine, was Subyon and all his accomplices
brought to execution.  now the neues being caried
with the swift wings of fame into Frizeland, the
Lords of Frize repaired to Tormaday, to accompany
home their aged King, and to congratulate this happy
marriage of Blanchardine and his new Queene.</P>
<P>After the aged King of Frize, Father to Blanchardine,
had seene the espousalls of this beautifull
Queene and his noble Sonne; being decrepit & stiffe
with age, hauing liued to fourscore and vpward, vnto
whome, although his late enlargement from captiuitie,
and this new-come ioy of his deere sonne Blanchardine,
being now married to the beautifull Queene of Tormaday,
bred delight; Yet through debillitie of nature,
which was sore infeebled by his hard imprisonment, he
was surprised with an vncoth malladie and extreame
contagion of dangerous sicknes; in the which he had
not long remained, but in the view of all, life began to
vade, and death opproche.  And more to hasten on
deathes speedy pace to this sencles olde man, the
nobles of Frizeland, hauing receiued sure and certaine
inteligence from Tormaday of the life and freedome of
their King at that time there, and the princely mariage
which now was fully concluded betweene his successiue
heire, their naturall leige Blanchardine, with the renouned
Lady and Queene of Tormaday, they came
thither; at whose approche, this fainting olde man,
hoping to receiue glad tidings from his aged wife the
Queene of Frize, began with cheerefull countenance to
lift himselfe vp in his bed, as though no kinde of
<pb N="213"  ID="pb.384" >
deadly malladie or aged griefe had attainted his
withered limbes.  But when he had a while listened
to the sweet harmonie of their sugred speach, which
presaged no kind of disaster, but all pleasure and
sollace that might be, at the length he demaunded of
the welfare of the aged Queene his wife; vnto whome,
reply being made, that long time since, vpon the vnfortunate
report and tragicall tidings of his captiuitie by
Darius, sonne to the Pagan king Alimodes, shee fell
sicke and died; hee, listening to this impittious tale,
fell as one distraught into a sound.  But comming to
himselfe, powred forth these speeches, <MILESTONE N="I 3, back" UNIT="sign.">the true testimonies
of his faithfull loue: 'and is she gon, the
comfort of my youth, the staffe of my age, the day of
my night, the sonshine of my blisse, the sollace of my
soule, and the life of my death?  Ah! to to well I suspected
(though alas I knew not the certentie) that my
captiuitie would bring her callamity, and my imprisonment
her death.  But since all humane flesh is mortall,
and nothing vnder the Sunne permanent, what auailes
my sorowful grones and passions?  to weake, alas, to
recall her againe, or any way to remedie my misfortune!'
with these or the like exclaimes, this silly aged
King, panting betweene life and death, lay still a while,
till finding his heart ouer charged with an other passion,
he prosecuted his first complaint: 'O sacred Ioue,
searcher of all secret thoughts, whose eternall dietie
raigneth within the highest heauens, who from my
cradle hast destined me to perpetuall miserie, now shew
thy self a righteous iudge, and reuenge my wronges
<pb N="214"  ID="pb.385" >
vppon the accursed broode of infidels, who so irreligiously
prophane thy blessed name, & suffer them not to
escape thy reuenging powre, but at thy pleasure consume
and confound the workers of this my woe! and
now dissolue my daies and weary life, & leade me
through th' unknowne passages to my deere and
sweetest wife, that though our daies on earth did finde
small comfort, yet our soules in heauen may finde consolation.'
And with this orizon he yeilded himself to
God, and died.  When the brute of this heauie tidinges
came to the eares of Blanchardine and his faire Queene,
although they swume before in the hauen of happines,
and floted on the floodes of al felicitie (as they thought),
yet in that very instant and moment of time, a cloudie
mist began to obscure their brightest sonshine, and a
frost of cares to ouer runne their summers blisse.</P>
<P>Now began Blanchardine to accuse and condemne
himselfe of vnnaturall ingratitude and disobedience to
his parentes, to whome both nature and dutie bound
him to bee submissiue and kind; now he began to
maligne the time, the place, and the cause of his departure
and priuie escape from his fathers Court.  But
all in vaine, for as teares, praiers, nor vowes can recall
the dead: so had I wist, and time abused and mispent,
is in vaine to <MILESTONE N="I 4" UNIT="sign.">be desired.  'And yet (quoth he) how
vnnaturall was I to forsake them whome nature charged
me to loue and obey! now I may iustlie accuse my self
of the murther of these my louing parents: alas! I cannot
excuse my selfe, neither can I plead ignoraunce that
I knew not that my departure would be the finishing
of my parentes ioyes, and cause of their death, which
now (to my open shame) I finde most true.  And
should I, nay, could I, suffer my selfe to be led and
carried away with such vaine fantasies, as leaue them
<pb N="215"  ID="pb.386" >
comfortles to whome I was the greatest comfort.  Die,
Blanchardine, die! and the rather die, that art the cause
of thy parents death: alas! to kill a man is hainous
murder; but to murder my parentes, a sinne against
Sanctitie: all creatures haue care to foster those that
gaue them life; and I, careles in killing my father.

with famine, taketh him vpon his shoulders, and feedeth
him by his trauaile: But I, insteede of feeding, haue
famisht, and in place of trauelling, haue traiterously
ouerthrowne my parents.'</P>
<P>The Lordes of Tormaday, seeing this soddaine and
vnexpected chaunce of the death of the aged King, &
the heauie plight of Blanchardine and his beautifull
Qu&eacute;ene, humbly on their knees began to expostulate
him in this manner: 'Noble prince! as the salue commeth
to late, where the sore is irrecuperable; as phisicke
is naught worth where the pacient is passing; and as
fire giuen to the ordinance, tis to late to recall the
shot; So, mightie King, booteles are these teares which
are shed for the dead.  the honor of your father hath
eterniz'd his name for euer, though his body be here
interred; and if fame be the marke whereat all noble
mindes do shoote, then may you boast that he cannot
die whose fame is so ferre spred throughout the world.
Leaue therefore (braue King) to bewaile him whome
you haue cause to ioy for, and comfort our pensiue
Queene and your faire spouse, whose torments cannot
cease, seeing you so sad.'  As one newly risen from a
traunce, or out of a heauy slumber, so Blanchardine,
hauing listened to this short and sweete discourse of his
nobles, began to recall his sences home, which before
were wandring after the Ghost of his father, through
<pb N="216"  ID="pb.387" >
the Elizian feeldes, and <MILESTONE N="I 4, back" UNIT="sign.">perceiuing sorrow to be both
needlesse and bootlesse, so well as the time and this
hard occasion would permit, he began to be more
cheereful; and so pacing toward the Queene with a
simpering smile, neither presaging mirth nor mourning,
he began to recomfort her: 'How now, faire loue?
what, are your melancholies such as nothing can make
you merrie? sweete hart, be pacified, and shake of these
vntimelye passions, and learne by me to disgest the
hard and harsh pilles of vnhappie fortune.  The cause
is mine; and if sorrow be expected in any, it is I that
must be sorrowful; but I haue found it both hurtfull to
my body and [not] auailable<note ID="note.461" >? unavailable</NOTE> to the dead, and therefore
haue shaken it of as a thing of no regarde.  Let vs not
therefore (sweete wife) be the cause of a mournfull
courte, but the authors of merry company, since it hath
pleased God to sorte our haps to our harts contentments
in our happy wedding.'  The Queene, whose sadnes
grew by reason of her husbands heauinesse, seeing him
to haue so quickly dismissed his heauy passions, became
presentlye iocond & merry; & so betweene them
commaunded great preparation to be forthwith made, to
performe the obsequies of the deceased King of Freeze,
his Father; which shortly, with all solemnitie fitting
his estate, was accomplished, to the great admiration of
all beholders, for the sumptuous magnificencie and surpassing
pompe wherwith he was interred; all costly
odors and sweet senting spices were bountifully bestowed<pb N="217"  ID="pb.388" >
vpon him; great almes and charity were dealt
and distributed; and innumerable sollemne processions
& praiers were made for him, in honor of his person
dead, and loue of his Sonne liuing.</P>
<P>Now Sadonie, who was not only a beholder, but a
principall actor in all this heauy tragedie, after these
obsequies were solemnized, and that the estate of his
sworne freend Blanchardine and his faire Queene rested
in perfect quiet, voyde and free both of forraine and
domesticall enimies, bethinking himselfe of his beautifull
Beautrix, his trusty Regent of Cassidony (hee, I
say) whome loue had stonge to the quicke by his late
marriage, comming to Blanchardine, began thus: 'Since,
Noble freend, and true copartner of all mishaps, that
fortune hath spit her deadly spight, <MILESTONE N="K 1" UNIT="sign.">and that now
there remaineth no more seruice for me to doe in defence
of your royall person, your Realme and Queene;
and that my princely Queene languisheth at home, by
reason of my long absence, whose princely person is
the true Idea of my thought; let me craue fauor to
depart, vntill occasion or your freendly letters call me
hether againe, where and when I will not faile, so long
as life shall rest within me, to do you all possible fauor
and kindnes.'  Blanchardine (imagining by himselfe)
that the Sting of loue was a sufficient pricke to call
Sadony home, and that he should greatly iniury him &
his faire Beautrix, in withholding them a sunder; not
onely gaue his consent for his departure, but with all
honor accompanied him to his ships, with his Princely
Eglantine, where, not without millions of teares and
many kind imbracements, they parted companie.</P>
<P>Thus with pleasant gale and quiet tide, Neptune
<pb N="218"  ID="pb.389" >
guiding the healme, sayled Sadony and his warlike companie
towardes the Realme of Cassidony, where his
princely Queene, the beautifull Beautrix, held her
Royall court, but heauy and mournfull for the absence
of her Lorde and husband Sadony; for wrathfull
Nemisis, enuying of her good hap, and willing to heape
greater woes vpon the Queene, then before shee suspected,
altered her hoped blisse into a deadly bane.
For when the calme silence of the night procured quiet
to all liuing creatures, and that Hesperus, the harbenger
of Cinthia, had giuen charge to call the inferior stars
with twinkling light to illumine the earth; Eolus on
the sodaine began to roare, and with outragious stormes
and cruell blastes to bannish againe the starrs from the
firmament, & in their places to spred his dusky clouds,
so that instead of light there was obscuritie, with huge
and horible crakes of thuunder: By force whereof, the
wandering Prince Sadony and his amazed company
were, from a sodaine hope of happy arriuall, driuen
into a dismall feare of drowning: then began the pittifull
clamor of the people, seeing euery waue ready to
swallow up the ship wherein they were caried, the foggy
mist to thicken with cloudy vapors, that vnneth could
the saylors see to doe their labours.  Sadony (whose
corage no fortune was able to daunt) ha-<MILESTONE N="K 1, back" UNIT="sign.">uing his assured
hope in the God whome Blanchardine made him to
know, seeing his company to faint and in dispaire,
began to exhort and comfort them in this sort:</P>
<P>'Trustie companion[s] and copartners of mishap,
since it hath pleased the maiestie of the eternall God
to terrifie with his thunderclaps our feeble hearts, and
that all hope of safetie is vtterly denied; let vs with
one consent humble our selues before his mercy seat;
and no doubt, as in many other our calamities, so in
this our desperate distress, he will with the eyes of
pitty looke downe vpon our penitencie, and by his
<pb N="219"  ID="pb.390" >
omnipotency appease the rage of these troubled seas,
which threateneth imminent death and destruction.
Frollike, deere friends! and the God of Blanchardine
defend us!'  The company seeing Sadonie so coragious
and full of haughtie valor, inciting them to call vpon
the God of Blanchardine, euery one casting away his
dastard feare, eleuating their hearts and hands to
heauen, made their orizons thus: 'Imortall Iehoua,
guider of this glorious roume! although our dim-sighted
eies haue been long couered with the obscure vaile of
ignorance, & haue abandoned our hearts from thy
sacred law, yet since it hath pleased thee to make thy
name and glorie knowne among vs, suffer vs not to
miscarie, vntill wee haue yeelded thee all conding and
heauenly honor, so that from our lips thy praise may
flow, and in our hearts thy diety take roote!'  No
sooner was this short & zealous praier finished, but
horned Luna began to shew her head, the cloudes to
vanish, the windes to cease, and the sea to calme,
which yeelded such fuell to their faith, that for euer
they acknowledged the omnipotence of Blanchardines
God, and left the same to their posterities.  Then the
skilfull Pilots, whose wandring course was past their
compasse, looking to the skyes, were directed a true
passage by a christall starre, so that within short time
they reacht the shore of Cassidony, where the beautifull
Beautrix, with her Lordly Peeres and Princely
Ladies, awaited their landing.  When Sadony was
<pb N="220"  ID="pb.391" >
now escaped the danger of the sea, and safely come
a shore, after humble thankes to God, he seazing vpon
the rosiall lips of his royall Queene, in whose countenance
snow and blood made such a mixture, that in
<MILESTONE N="K 2" UNIT="sign.">the opinion of all, if nature should deuise to frame
her paragon she might fayle in perfection.  But after
many kinde curtesies and amiable imbracements betweene
Sadony and his Beautrix, and the Lordes and
Ladies, where euery one stroue with kindnes to welcome
home her loue, they repaired to the court, where,
for that night, the King and his Queene spent the time
in content, and al the rest congratulated their happy
meetings.  On the morrow, when glorious Ph&oelig;bus
began to cut the cloudes, and drewe the darknes from
the earth, every one prepared himselfe to be ready to
attend the princes pleasure.</P>
<P>After Sadony had royally presented himselfe to the
veiw of all, giuing a princely boniure to the Lordes
and nobles, he commaunded that the soldiers, whose
trauels had beene great, should repaire to his presence,
to receiue a recompence for their paines; which bountie
did so combine the trustie minds of all vnto him, that
base was he accompted, that would refuse to hazard his
life where and when it pleased Sadony to commaund.
Then were the lawes, which in his absence the Qu&eacute;ene
and Counsell had deuised, presented to him to ratifie,
which he with all princely magnificencie did forthwith
establish, to the great admiration and singuler content
of all his subiectes and people.  Now tatling swiftwinged
fame, the speedy messenger of happie newes,
ceased not vntil these tidinges were brought to the
eares of the King of Spruse at the cittie Marienbourgh
(then in his profound and deep meditations for his
sonne Sadony), and his departed companion.  But
when he heard of the hard aduentures which his sonne
had escaped by sea, his deliuerie from death on land,
<pb N="221"  ID="pb.392" >
and his most happy marriage with the beautifull
Beautrix, banishing feare (whose cankering rust had
almost consumed his pleasure) hee, with all his nobles
and people, offered burnt sacrifices to their Mahon for
this happie tidings.  Yet not content nor satisfied in
minde, he rigged certaine ships, wherein he and diuers
of his Lordes embarqued themselues, longing to visite
his son at Cassidonie; and led by this sweete desire,
after they had sayled the space of one weeke, they
came ashore within those territories.  But when newes
was brought to Sadony that certaine <MILESTONE N="K 2, back" UNIT="sign.">Pagans were
arriued, and craued to bee admitted his princely presence:
Ignorant altogether what or whence they
shoulde be: seating himselfe in his Royall throne,
accompanied with his faire Queene and chiefe peeres,
hee commaunded them to bee brought to his presence,
vpon whose approche, Sadony knowing his father by the
maiestie of his countenaunce, desended from his seate,
humbling himselfe on his kn&eacute;es at his fathers feete.  The
faire Beautrix vnwitting who he might be, to whome
Sadony should shewe such reuerence, stood in a maze.
But after she knew him to be father to Sadony, with a
most gracious and amiable cheere came to entertaine
him; to whome the King of Spruse rendred millions
of thankes, both for the life and marriage of his
sonne, without whose rescue hee had bin traiterously
murdred, and hanged by Alimodes.  But the faire
Qu&eacute;ene answered, that both her life, liuing, and people
rested in the safetie of Sadony, 'without whome (quoth
shee) neythir may I, nor my kingdome, continue.'  Now
when the King of Spruse had listened to her zealous
and sugred tale, fixing a stedfast countenaunce on her
face, he seemed as one rauished in contemplation, admiring
the beauty and bounty of the Queene.  But Sadony,
thinking his father (after his ariual from sea) to be
desirous to repose himself, led him with all maiestie
<pb N="222"  ID="pb.393" >
into a most princely lodging; where after his repast, he
went to bed.  the other Lords of his troope, and all
their followers, were so honorably entertained there,
that the commendation of Sadonies bountie was bruted
euery where.  Now on the next morning, when (according
to custome) Sadony and his faire Queene repaired
to the Church to heare deuine seruice, the King of
Spruse not suspecting that his Sonne Sadony had
altered his religion from his Mahomet; after the
Priestes had begun to sing a sollemne procession in
the honor of Christ, he, as a man distraught in sence,
and ouercome with madding frenzy, ran vp and downe
cursing and exclaiming against his sonne, so that neither
perswasions, teares, vowes, nor praiers, might once appease
his franticke rage; till retiring himself all sollitary
into his chamber, tormented with passions & agonies,
at length he fell a sleep; to whome, a little after, entred
diuers of the Lordes <MILESTONE N="K 3" UNIT="sign.">which accompanied Sadonie from
Marienbrough with Blanchardine, and perswaded the
King that the idolatrous Mahomet was a false deceauer,
and of no diety, which by sundry and wonderfull
miracles, they had founde Christ to be the true Messias
and sonne of God; and, therefore, with all humilitie,
ioyntly on their knees, they entreated his maiestie to
leaue his superstitious worshipping of blockish Mahomet,
and with all deuotion to <CORR SIC="acknowledged">acknowledge</CORR> Christ to
be the true God.  And euen at that very instant the
stony heart of this Pagan King was mollified, who forsaking

newes so delighted his sonne, that vnder heauen nothing
could make him more content.  Then laboured Sadony
and his faire Queene, with all royaltie, to welcome their

the tickle state of his fathers kingdome, in his absence,
wanting a gouernour there, was the more willing; and
so, all possible prouision being made, with princely
bounty bestowed by Sadony and his Beautrix vpon the
Lords of Spruse, they accompanied the King to his

father, and kinde curtesie to the rest, he recommended
them to the mercy of Blanchardines God.</P><TRAILER>Thus, Gentlemen, to satisfie your expectations, &
