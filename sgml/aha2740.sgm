<NOTE PLACE="end">[NOTE.&mdash;As far back as Anthony Wood's time (City of Oxford, ii. 190-2) the preceding section of the Oseney Register was felt to be a puzzle, and many of the names in it long remained untraced. The Rev. H. E. Salter, by collation of the original Oseney deeds as well as of the Registers, has solved the problem of the section and identified its names. The 'charter,' he points out, must have been invented after 1191, by tacking together several grants of earlier and later dates, without the least attempt to make them fit in with each other. The charter, by its witnesses, professes to be of date 1149, but Robert Doyly II died seven years before that. The bishop of Lincoln at the foundation of Oseney was Alexander, not Robert. The constructor of the charter may have taken the name Robert either from Alexander's predecessor, Robert Bloet (1093-1123), who during his episcopate seems to have granted a confirmation-charter to St. George's church; or from Alexander's successor, Robert de Chesnei (1147-68), who in 1149 sanctioned the grant, by Henry Doyly I, of St. George's church and its possessions to Oseney. The deed makes Oseney in 1149 possessed of Frees chapel, which in fact was the gift of Thomas of St. Walery about 1191; and of the tithes of Twycross and Warton obtained in 1187-9 by an exchange, which is fully described in the Oseney Cartulary. The list of places is confused by the jumbling together of names taken from different confirmations. Thus, the scribe gives both Perieth and Woodperry, but they are probably the same; so also, probably, Leyes and Northlye; Asshe and Tenesse; Cawdewell (Caldewell) and Goldwell.]</NOTE>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>1225, May 22. Contro|versy be|tween Oseney and St. Frides|wyde's, about tithes of hay and corn in several places near Oxford, were re|ferred to arbitrators, by whose offices Oseney surren|dered to St. Frides|wyde's all claim to tithes in Thomley; and to cer|tain tithes in Put|mead, Halkwere and Brad|more; and to half of tithe of Wyvelsey: St. Frides|wyde's sur|rendered to Oseney all claim to tithes of meadows west of Oseney and to tithes of Nor|tham: the tithe of 'the lynch' to go with that of the meadow to which it belongs, or to be divided: expense of getting tithe-hay of Wyvel|sey to be shared. Oseney to have tithe|hay of Andrew of Cowley; and tithe of Hulc mills so long as held by present tenant. Oseney also to have a quit-rent (challenged by St. Frides|wyde's) of 9d. in St. Mary Mag|dalen parish.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="end">[NOTE.&mdash;This is not the place to discuss a very interesting, but most obscure, point in Oxford topography, as to which Anthony Wood himself is more than usually hesitating (City of Oxford, ii. 112-7). Still, since it is distinctly brought up in these documents, the facts may be briefly set down. (A) Between Oxford Castle and the site of Oseney stands St. Thomas' parish church, now, and for long back, the mother church of the west suburbs of Oxford: see Map at beginning of Wood's <I>City of Oxford</I>, ii. (B) No. 66 describes the founding of a chapel near the gate of Oseney. Were (A) and (B) separate or the same? What were the date and occasion of their foundation and refoundation, or dates and occasions of their foundations? Oseney tradition, set out in no. 63, may at once be dismissed. Could a church have been built, on the sudden inroad of war into Oxford west suburb, between Sept. and Dec. 20, 1142? Could a church have even been begun, almost within bow-shot of a hotly-besieged castle? The most probable solution of the difficulty is to take nos. 64 and 66 together, and no. 65 as referring to a distinct building. In no. 65 we have the grant by the diocesan of a semi|domestic chapel, apparently within Oseney island, probably destroyed at the dis|solution. After Oseney, in 1152, obtained possession of St. George's in the Castle (no. 23), the abbey may reasonably be supposed to have provided a more convenient church for its large parish in the west suburb of Oxford. This would account for the Church of St. Thomas the Martyr, which seems to be implied in no. 66.]</NOTE>

First, is the conveyance (reason not stated) of Medley to Oseney by Oxford town in 1147, the quit-rent (no. 69) being 6s. 8d. Afterwards, this quit-rent was doubled (no. 70), on fresh warranty being given. A sufficient reason for this warranty is found in the claim made for possession of Medley by St. Frideswyde's priory (Wigram's <I>Cart. S. Frid</I>., i. 36-8), which the town staved off (1191) by agreeing to pay 8s. yearly to the priory. In 1209 happened the 'sus|pensio clericorum,' for which the town was laid under interdict. In 1214, the town submitted and agreed to pay a sum yearly to the University through St. Frides|wyde's and Oseney; changed in 1219, to through Einsham. The assignment of the 13s. 4d. quit-rent to St. Frideswyde's by the town is no doubt part of the 1214 arrangements. Wood's <I>City of Oxford</I>, i. 330, wrongly dates the affray in 1144, to make it coincident with the original conveyance of the island.]</NOTE>

This Margaret became second wife (1247) of Henry III's favourite, John of Plessets, who obtained in 1253 a grant of the barony of Hooknorton, which had been resumed by the crown. In this he was succeeded in 1263 by Hugh, his son by his first wife, who died 1291. For this Hugh's son Hugh, see no. 93.]</NOTE>

<P>1285, May. Claim against Oseney, by a Jewess of London for &pound;1 6s. 8d., and inter|est (accrued before the statute of 1275), being half of a mortgage over lands of William le Blund now held by Oseney. Oseney maintained that at the time of making of the mort|gage the lands be|longed to Oseney, and that Wil|liam le Blund had no power to mortgage them. Inquiry was ordered by the sheriff, but did not take place. Inquiry was again ordered by Robert of Lode|ham, to whom the jury returned that Oseney had been feoffed of the lands in question for more than 40 years, and there|fore before the mort|gage (whose date was 1275, Aug. 27).
