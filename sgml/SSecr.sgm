Soft hyphens, even in the case of a word split over folio breaks, are removed, and the complete word is placed before the milestone markers and page breaks.  In the second manuscript the Book divisions have been retained, and Book I begins with chapter 6.  Chapters 62 and 70-75 of the second manuscript, though indexed, are not translated in the MS and so are not included in either the printed edition or this electronic edition.  The two sets of milestone markers in the third manuscript have been retained, although it is unclear to which manuscript the second set refers (e.g. 45b L).  It likely refers to Lambeth MS. 633, although this has not been confirmed.  See introductory "Note" below.  The table of contents for the third manuscript does not include page numbers, but for the ease of the reader, page numbers have been added.  The text  has been proofed through page 80 with an approximate error rate of one error per ten thousand characters.</P>

<HEAD>The Prologe of a gret doctour recomendyng Aristotille.</HEAD>
<P>gOd almyghty kepe oure kyng and conferme his Rewme
in the lawe of god, and make him regne in gladnes, in
lovyng, and in worshipe of god.  I that am servitoure of
the kyng, haue put in execucioun his comaundement, and
travaylid forto gete the book of good thewes to him; whiche is
callid the secrete of secretis of the makyng of Aristotille, prince
of philesofris, sone of Machomete of macedonye, which was sent
to his discipille as in governaunce Alexandre the emperoure,
sone of kyng Philip of Grece, the whiche Alexaundre had two
Crownes.  This book made this forseyd Aristotille in his gret
age, whan he myght not travayle ne done the nedis that he had
in charge of Alexandre.  ffor Alexandre had made him governoure
and maystir aboue alle othir, for the excellent witt &thorn;at he had in
clergie and sotille vndirstondyng, for euyr he was stodiyng in
good and gracious thewes, charitabille, spirituelle and
contemplatyf; and also he was so wys &amp; meke, and lovyd resoun and
rightwisnes; and euyr reportid trouthe and lewte.  Therfore
oold Philesofres seyne by him, that they haue founden in Greke
bokis that god hath sent his excellent Aungille and seyde to
him, "y shalle do the to be namyd thorugh alle the world more
for Aungille than for man."  And witith welle that Aristotille
made in his lyvyng many wondres, of the whiche <MILESTONE N="2b" UNIT="folio">some be right
meruelous to telle; and in his diyng fille many mervelous
thingis.  Wherfore a certeyne Religioun helde an opynyon that
Aristotille was mountid vp to hevene in lyknes to a dowue of
fyre.  And as long as Aristotille lyvid, Alexandre bi his
counselle helde alle londis vndir foote and conquerid alle lordshipes
of the world, and thorugh alle londis went his fame and his
renome.  Alle nacions were putt vndir his imperialite and
comaundement, and specially they of perce and of Arabie, and
no lond durste withstond him in word nor dede.  And
Aristotille made many fayre Epistolis for the gret loue that he had
to Alexandre, forto make him knowe alle secretis that bilongith
any erthely man to knowe or vndirstond.  And on of his
Epistelis is here vndir writene, which he sent to Alexandre.  ffor
whan Alexandre had put hem of Perce in subieccioun, and the
grettist men of Romaynes had in his prisone, he sent an Epistille
to Aristotille in these wordes folowyng.

customyd to make or vnmake alle werkis and secretis, that y ne
haue sought hem.  Ne y haue herd told of no wise mane &thorn;at

and indignacioun of god, forto shewe thee his secretis, as he of
his excellent goodnes hath shewid hem to me.  And  therfore
and thou discouere hem vnto eny at eny tyme, wite welle that
sone aftir thou shalt haue y-nowe of yville fortunes, and &thorn;ou
shalt not eschewe the grete disesis that are hastily to come, fro
the whiche god kepe the euermore, amen.  And loke in alle

&thorn;at eche kyng haue two thingis to susteyne him and his Rewme,
but he may not haue hem but he be stedfast in gouernaunce, so
that alle tho that ben vndir his regne ben of oon obeyshaunce,
and in on subieccioun of trewe ligeaunce vnto her liege kyng, for
disobeyshaunce of subiectis is most enfleccioun and enfeblisshyng
of euery lord.  ffor if the subiectis regne, the lordis myght is
litill or ellis nought, and y shalle shewe yow cause whi.  The
subiectis ben mevid in corage forto obeye her lord, and &thorn;at is for
two causis; the on cause is within, the othir cause without.
The cause without <MILESTONE N="4b" UNIT="folio">is whene the lord wisely dispendith his
goodis and his ricchessis among his subiectis, And that he
yeue yeftis largely to euery man aftir that he is worthi: and this
is a gret poynt of wisdome, forto enforce him silf to haue the
hertis of his subiectis thorugh good werkis. and this is the first
degre and principalle foundacioun of his prosperite.  And that
he mayntene rightwisnes and even iustice, as welle to poore as
to riche, and that his rightwisnes be medlid with pite and
mercy.  The cause within is, that his philesofris and grete
wisemen of clergie be had in worshipe and high recomendacioun:
ffor god hath recomendid to hem a part of his high science.
And y recomende to the this science and secrete of wisdome,
forthwith the othir that thou shalt fynde in dyuerse partis of
this book, in the whiche thou shalt fynde high doctryne, for
thou shalt fynde the cause fynalle of thi principalle purpos.
ffor whan thou hast vndirstond the sothe of the significacions of
the wordis, and &thorn;e derknes of the examples, than shalt thou
haue fully and perfitly alle that thou desirist.  Thus pray y god,

<pb N="7" ID="pb.7" >
rightwis and glorious kyng, that he enlumyne thi resoun and
thyn vndirstondyng, so that thou may come and parceyve the
secretis of this science, that thou may be therin myn heyr and
myn only successoure, and that graunt the god, that his ricchesse
enlargisshith and habundauntly yefith vnto lijf of wys men;
And yefith grace to do [to those] &thorn;at stodien forto knowe that is

<HEAD> Of the largenes of a kyng. Cam. 4m.</HEAD>
<P>tHer are foure condiciones of kyngis.  ther is a kyng that
is large to him silf and large to his <MILESTONE N="5a" UNIT="folio">sugetis.  Ther is a
kyng that is skars to him silf and large to his sugetis.  Ther is
a kyng that is larg to him silf, and skars to his sugetis.  And
ther is a kyng that is both skars to him silf, and to his sugetis
also.  Men of ytalie seyne, that ther is no vice in that kyng
that is skars to him silf, and large to his sugetis.  The Iew
saith, that kyng is good that is skars to him silf and to his
sugetis bothe.  The parisien saith, that kyng that is large to
him silf and to his sugetis bothe, he is not worthi to be in no
preysyng, but werst of alle othir.  And if he be skars to him
silf and to his sugetis bothe, his Rewme may not stonde longe
in prosperite but sone come to distruccioun.  Than it nedith
wisely to enquere of vertues and of vicis, what is largesse and
what is skarsnes, and wherin stondith the erroure of largesse,
and what disese cometh of skarsnes.  It is clere thing, that &thorn;e
qualitees arne forto be reprovid, whan they aliene them from
ther meene.  And wite ye welle that it is hard thing forto kepe

<P>IN olde tyme in kyngis ther was wondyrful reddure of
ryght to kepe wel the lawys, wherof tellyth the wyse clerke
Valery, that kynge &yogh;alente stabelid many good lawis in his Cite
of locre.  Of the whych this was oone, "That who so euer were
atteyntid of Spowse-brige, he sholde lesse both his eighyn."
Aftyr hit be-felle his owyn Sone to be founde in the Same Syne,
and al the Cite atte the <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="folio">Honour and reuerence of the fadyr, to
the Sone relessid the Payne of the eighyn,<note ID="note.63" >eughyn, MS.</NOTE> But the kynge ne
wolde nat Suffyr by his will.  They of the Cite so Entierly
praid and bosoght the kynge, that he grauntid oone of his
Sones eghyne to be Sawid, But for-why he wolde not his law
breke, Fryst he makyd his owyn eigh to be out-rasit, and
Sethyn oone of his Sonnes, And So he mayntenyd his lawe, and
relessit the duresse of the laue.  So that wondyrfull euenys
hym departid betwen the Pite of the fadyr, And the
ryghfulnesse of the good Iuge.  By this apperid wel, that by law he
Iugid al otheres ryghtfully, that wold not spare his Sone.  Of
force of Powere hit apperid also, and hit is to witte, Force of
Power is noght aftyr the nombre of pepill, but aftyr the myght
of tham that in armes ben prouyd, and aftyr the good
gouernance of the witti and wyse Prynce, wyth-out wyche nombre of
pepil lytill is worth or noght.  Of this We fyndyth i-write, that
Xerses, kynge of Inde, that wolde batailli with the Pepil of
grece, strongly gederid huge hostis of whych <MILESTONE N="5bL" UNIT="folio">no man couth tell

<pb N="129" ID="pb.129" >
the nombyr.  Wherfor some of his men sayde that the Grecans
wolde not abyde to hyr tythynges of the battalle, but fle at the
fryste hyrynge of hit.  Otheris sayde that the grecanys (or
grekis, whych  you semyth beste Englyshe) ne shold not be
scomfite, forthy so few Pepill wolde not meld in battail, but
a-noone thay wolde be al fallynge dovne, and take of the gastnys
Of So grete an hoste.  Otheris Sayde that hit was to drede that
thay sholde fynde the Cite of grece woyde, that the kynge
sholde not fynde werre that he myght werre, othyr his Pouere
Show.  Otheris sayd that vnneth wolde Suffice to ar kynges
hoste the largenesse of al Grece in lond, See ne hyre, for he had
So hugy a meney that the grece See was to streyte to hame,
And that the Plente of his bachelerie was so grete that al the
campany of the londe wolde not Suffice har tentes and Paueillons
to Piche, And lasse to fyght, or any assaut to make, And that
the eyre myght not receue the Plente of har arowes an dartis.
So hugely on Such maner thay losyngid the kynge of
Wayneglory of the force of his hoste, that this losyngeris makyd hym
ouer-sette the wysse consaille of Damazate, the Prowid wyse
clerke, That to hym sayde, "The flostrynge of the losengers that

thynge that a man may not gouerne hit may noght endure.
Nothynge Erthely is noght so grete, that hit ne may Peryshe

Damazates sayde betyde the kynge.  For that grete hoste, for
defaute of ryght Purveyaunce and wyse gouernaunce, was

Nero hadde the wyse Clerke Seneca to his mayster; This
wourthy Clerke Seneca longe abode and hadde hoppe of grete

Nero, "chese in whate tree thow wilte be on-hangi&dtail;, for that

Than makyd Nero a Sharpe Swerde to florysh ouer Seneca is

hym sayde, "chese hastely the dethe, and tary thow not."
Than he makyd hym a bathe to be ordeynyd, and of bothe his
armes in the bath to lette blode.  So myche he bledd that in
the bath he diet.  Boyce in the boke of consolacioun seyth, that
this Nero makyd his brodyr to be slay&ntail;, and his modyr he

grete doloure and Payne hadd my modyr wyth me," and the
Ficiciens sayde, <MILESTONE N="21L" UNIT="folio">"That may not be, for hit is agaynys kynde."
Than sayde ham Nero, "If ye make me not wyth chylde, wyth

and Paule: ther-aftyr he hym be-thoght and merveillid of the
brandynge of Troy.  And forwhy that he wolde witte how grete
was the fyre-blaste therof, he makyd the Cite of Rome afyre to

Passynge faire towre huge of heyght in the Cite afyre was.

bare with hym al necessaries for a man that ride sholde; the
Ieue went on his fete, and noothynge he had to ette ne noone

the Iue answerid, "I belewe that in hewyn is oone god whyche

And aftyr he sette hym on his Mule.  Anoone aftyr the Iue
Saw that he was wel ydressi&dtail;, and that the mule was swyfte,

by the whyche fals Iuges queyntly he chastid.  Arystotle
preysyth the vertu of Iusticia, and Sayth, that hit is the moste
faryste vertu of all vertues, more bryghtyr Shynynge than the
day-sterre.  And therfor wyth-out this vertu may no Prynce
ryghtfully regne.  For the Powere of a prynce that is not
ryghtfull demenyt, ys lykenyd to a sharpe Swerde in a

<pb N="168" ID="pb.168" >

to al tho that Subiectes to hym byth.  And therfor Sayde the
Pepill of Iude, that the ryghtfulnesse of a prynce ys more
profitabill to his subiectis, than Plente of mettes and drynkes.
Helinaund, that stories of Romanys wrote, tellyth in his boke
that Traiane the Emperoure of Rome leped vp to hors and redy
was to go to battaill.  there came forthe a widdowe and hym
helde by the fote, and delfully hyr Playnyd, and with wepynges
hym Prayed, that he wolde do hyr ryght, Of tho men that hyr
Sone had Slaynne, whych was not but an Innocent, And Sayde,
"Syre, thou arte Emperoure, and I haue Sufferid the cruell
wronge." the Emperoure answerid, "whan y come agayne, I
shall do thyn asseth."  She sayde, "and whate yf hit happe
that thou neuer agayne come?"  "My successoure shall do the
ryght."  She answerid, "whate <MILESTONE N="31bL" UNIT="folio">shall hit availle the, the good
that anothyre man thy Successoure shall do?  Thou arte my
Doctoure, and aftyr thy deservynge thow shalte mede rescewe:
hit is wronge and dysceyte, noght pay the dette that is owynge.
Thy successoure, to ham that wronge Sufferyth, for hym-Silfe he
shall be bounde; Anothyr manys ryghtfulnes may not Saw the.
Hit shall be honoure to thy Successoure, and well hit shall hym
befall, yfe he may Sawe his owyne."  To this wordis the
Emperoures herte, tendyr of Pite that he toke of hyre wordis,
Anone he lyght doune of his hors, and Saate in Iugement, and
anone he did to the widdowe fully ryght.  And therfor the
Romanes makyd to hym an ymage in myde the Strete, to Show
how to the widdow he didde ryght, ar that he yede in werre vp
fellons and enemys of the Empire.  Anothyr tyme hit happid,
that Traiane his Sonne rode an hors vndauntdid, that ouer-trade
a weddowes Sone in the strete into the tyme that he die&dtail;.
<MILESTONE N="46b" UNIT="folio">She makyd Pleynte to the Emperoure, and there-of ryght
askyd.  He toke his owy&nmacr; So&nmacr;&nmacr;e, and hym to the widdow
yaue for his sone, that dede was, to do hyre wille wyth hym.
Therefor hit was cried in the Sene of the Senatoures of Rome
in audience of all the Pepill, "No man is more bessid than
Cesar Augustus, ne noo man bettyr than Traiane."  Moche
sholde oure crystyn Prynces reede and be ashamyd, whan thay

welle thay shall haue more rewarde.  Wherof hit is writtyn in
the boke of wysdome, "to Smale Pepill mercy shall be graunti&dtail;,

suffre."  Ther was an heremyte Sumtyme, that al tyme Prayed
god that he wolde shewe hy&mmacr; of whate merite he was and in
whate degre, Atte the laste a voyce frome hevyn hym answerid,
"Of the Same merite thou art, tofor god, as gregory the Pope."
than Sayde the heremyte, "Alas, In ille tyme came I into this
deserte, In ille tyme Saw y this hermytage, in myssaisse and
defaute, in full grete Sufferaunce haue I be so many Ieris, and
now ham I but y-like gregori the Pope, that hath So grette
honoure and reuerence and riches.  he hath so hey glorie and
Pouer, that all the worlde to hym Enclynyth and Subiecte is."
whan this heremyte so hym demenet he fell neygh in dyspayre;
the voyce of the angill hy&mmacr; Sayde, "Thow arte a fole dotdrat
and ouer-trowes.  how darryst thow make comparisone betwene
gregory and thy-Selfe? thou lowist more the catte that thou
haste, than gregory al the worlde."  Bi this hit apperyth full
well, that riches and heynesse of the worlde ne takyth away
good vertues: But more byth to Prayse the grete lordis, that
by witte and vertues ledyth and gouernyth the Pepill har

herte that yf hit hym Plesid, he sholde take this Emperoure
out of hell, and hym to Sawe.  An angill to gregori Sayde,
"atte this tyme god hath herde thy Prayere, Traian is sawid,
But fro hens-forward bid thou no more Suche Prayeris."  A,

<P>Oche desyre thes olde Pryncis to Putte hare lyues in
mbalaunce for comen Prowe of the Pepill, and they were so
hardy, that in Suche a Poynte thay douted not the deth;
for as Valery Sayth, and Seynte austynne hit rehersyth in the
boke of the Cite of god, Codre, Sumtyme kynge of the Cite of
Athenys, whan he had vndyrstonde by the Answere of his godys,
are that he to a certay&nmacr; battaille agaynes his enemys wente, that
thay the victori sholde haue in battaill whos kynge or duke sholde
be slayne in battaill, He onlasit his riche armes and roial array,<note ID="note.80" ><HI
REND="i">x</HI> partially altered to <HI REND="i">y</HI>.</NOTE>
and hym clothed in Pouer <MILESTONE N="35L" UNIT="folio">array, and wythout any drede he went
al dysharmyd ayeynnes the hostis of his enemys, and by
contencion ham taried, wherfore they hym Slewe anone.  For leuer hym
was deth to suffyr, that his men had the maystri, than lyue and
See his men to bene ouercome.  The Prynces in olde tyme ne
were not covetous of golde ne Siluer, And therfor more gladly
they yawyn than resceuet.  Vegesce tellyth, that a nobil
consailloure of Rome that Fabrice was callid, a wyse and a worthy
man &thorn;at lowid not yftis to rescewe, Answarid to an
Ambassatoure of a fere Estraunge contre, that hym proferid a grete Some
of golde, "Go," Sayde he, "to thy contrey wyth thy golde, I
haue no cure to resceue; Leuer is hit to me to comaunde tho
that the golde haue, than thare good to haue."  Sypion, the
nobill duke of Rome, whan he Saue well that haniball the
kynge of Cartage, that is Souerayne Cite o&ftee; affryke, had
besiegid the Cite of Rome longe tyme, and So hugely slayne of
the romanys that in oone day he dide fill thre bushelis of golde
ryngis, that weryn of the Pryncis and of the wourthy men of

<pb N="174" ID="pb.174" >
the Same Scypion, than, this Scipion, wyth his Chiualrie Passid
the See, and Came to Cartage and hit assiegid, wyth grete
manhode he makyd stronge assautes and harde; The Pepill by
Swerde and hungyr he Slow; thythyngis therof to Rome wente.
Haniball the Sige forsoke, hastely to Cartage he wente, wyth
Streynth he entried, by grete vertue the Cite restorid, he makyd
engynes, he gederid grete hostis, the Cite defendid, He ordaynyd
his shildrymes, steryn battaill he yaue, but atte the latyste
Scipion hym ouercome.  Than flow haniball throght al affrike
into A Castelle, <MILESTONE N="48b" UNIT="folio">and Into Streynthis.  Scipion hym chased
as a grefhound dothe the Fox.  Atte the latyr ende by wenym,
that <MILESTONE N="35bL" UNIT="folio">he dranke of his owyn will, he died, that he wolde not to
be takyn or Slayne of the Romans.  Than Scipion toke al
affrike, and So hit makid Subiecte to Romanys, and Payedyn
grete truage of golde and Siluer; he came agay&nmacr; to Rome, hole
and mery, and Sayde to the Romanes, "Fayre Sirres, affrike to
yow haue y conquerid, And nothynge of the conqueste haue y
rescewid Saue the Name."  As the tyme and the nedes askyd,
the Princis in olde tyme they contynued ham, Some tyme as a
lorde, anothyr tyme as a fellow, this wittnessyth Valery, that
tellyth that kynge alexandyr lad in a tyme a grete hoste in full
colde weddyr.  atte evy&nmacr; when he restid, he satte in oon hey
sette by a fyre; he rewardid aboute, and Sawe an olde knygth
quakynge for colde.  Anoone he descendid fro the Seete, And
toke the knygth in his armys, and Seete hym in the Sette by
the fyre, there as he hy&mmacr;-Selfe Sate.  And therfor hit was no
merveill that men wolde so gladly Serwe Suche a lord, that
bettyr lowid his knyght than his owy&nmacr; dignite.  Grete and hey
dedys toke on ham Prynces in olde tyme, And Smale thynges
thay letty&nmacr; to Smale men.  Ensampill of this vs tellyth Orosie,
that well couthe the Stories.  Cyrus, the kynge of Pers, hym
besied to conquere babilo&nmacr;, the grete stronge Cite; but he was
moche y-lettyd by an hugy ryuer rennynge by the Cite wallis.
In a day whan thay wolde assaute make, a knyght fryst by
foole-hardynys hym-Selfe to the ryuer Sette.  The course of the
ryuer So stronge and So styfe rane, that the knyght and his
hors rauyshith, doune hym bare, and dreynte.  Cyrus, the hardy
and manfull kynge, in grete wrathe Sayde, "So crowel
wengeaunce of this ryuer shal y take, that a woman wyth chylde hit
Shall mow Passe without Perill."  Than he did assembill
workemen
<pb N="175" ID="pb.175" >
 by thowsandis, and trenchyd and dalwe the growne, and
departid the ryuer in CCC and lx Parties, wherthrogh that al
men Smale and grete hit myght Passe wyth-out <MILESTONE N="36L" UNIT="folio">any damage.
than he toke the Cite, hit destrued, and the wallis therof he did
dow&nmacr;-caste into the fundemente.  Hit was not y-holde proesse ne
chyualry to assayle a man vnwarnyd, but olde men helde hit for
cowardy.  And therfore was alexandyr, the kynge Piames Sone
of Troy, moche to blame, that in the tempill of apollyn by
dysceyte and treyson slow achilles the worthy and doghty
knyght.  Holy writte reprowyth Ioab, Prynce of kynge Dauyes
hoste, for that he had Slay&nmacr; by trayson two prynces bettyr
that he was, Abner and amasam.  And therfore Salamon, kynge
Dauyes Son, therof Vengeance toke, and makyd hy&mmacr; be Slayne,
as the boke of kynges vs tellyth.  Trouthe and verite, more than
oppynyon or falsnesse, lowid olde Pryncis.  Ensampill of that
vs tellyth Valery, and Sayth that in olde tyme wher two
frendys, that oone was callid Hamound, that othyr Phicia.  On
of this was take by Denys, the cruel Tyraunte, kynge of Cezillie,
he woulde haue Slay&nmacr; hym, he askyd of his dethe respite in-to
the tyme that he had y-makyd his testament and dysposid his
godys.  The tyraunt hit grauntid vp that covnantte that he a
plege for hym wolde Putte into a certy&nmacr; day.  He Putte In his
frende for hym and went forthe.  Many dayes Passyd, the
terme neyghed, and he came not.  Euery man helde hym a fole
that faste was, and sayde, <MILESTONE N="49" UNIT="folio">"folych Haste thow done, to Putte
thy-Selfe in Hostage for thy frende.  He will not agayne cvm,
dey thow moste." he answerid, "I kno well my frende, that he
atte no tyme couaunt wold breke: well know I, and Sertayne I
haue of reuenine."  Whan the terme came, his frende repairet
and hym presentid, And to the tyraunt Seyd, "see me here, lete
my frende Passe, for y haue hym acquited."  Denys remembrid
hym of So grete <MILESTONE N="36bL" UNIT="folio">trouthe, frendshupe, and lewte, and for-yaue his
male talent, And prayet ham bothe to rescewe hym to ben thare
fellowe.  By losyngrie to Plese grete or Smale, hyt is contrary to
the vertue, Fortitudo, and therfor the Phylosofers that were full
of vertues, Leuer was to ham to Suffyr grete myssayse, than by
losyngerie grete auere to gette.  Als Valery tellyth, Dyogen the
Philosofre. in a certay&nmacr; day gederid wourtes to his mete, And
therfor a losynger Aristipus to hym Sayde, that was with denys
the tyraunt, "Diogen, thow sholdyst haue no mestere to ette

<pb N="176" ID="pb.176" >
wortes, and thow woldist losenge kynge denys."  Dyogen
answarid, "and thow woldiste ette Suche mette, thou Sholdyste
neuer nede to losynge kynge denys."  None hardy or manfull is
not lyght of thoght, nethyr haue no mervelle that many pouer
men mervelyth o&ftee;.  Of thes vs tellythe Valery, that in a certay&nmacr;
battaill descendyd an halte man, and therfore Some of the
Same battail hym Scornyd.  the halte man answerid, "I ne
ham not maymet in handis ne in armes, thegh y be halte-footed:
moche more bettyr I shall fyght, for y ne haue noo hope to fle."
Of anothyr he tellyth vs, to whom his fellowe sayde, "So grete
Plente thay of Pers haue of Arowes that the Sonne Vixith all
durke, whan they begynnyth to sote; bettyr is to fle than so
many Pepille to assaile."  That othyr as an hardy man answarid,
"the Plente of arowes that thow spekyste of sholde vs Plese
moche, ffor the weddyr is ful hote, And there-for moche the
bettyr we shall fyght vndyr the shedow of the arowes."
Ouermych to thynke dissayse and aduersiteis that ben Passid,
appertenyth not to hym that hardy is, for that shal make hym feynte.
For yf kynge Alexander had moch thoght of tribulacionys and
peynys that he Sufferid in Perse, he nade neuer be hardy to
entyr in Inde.  And yf Scipyon had ouermych chargid the
damages of Rome, he had neuer ben hardy to entyr in affrike.
Of the comendacio&nmacr; of Scipion we <MILESTONE N="37L" UNIT="folio">fyndyth y-writte, that als
longe as he hadd to done, hym thoght that nothynge was done.
Iulyus Cesar gladly for-yaue the wronges that to hym was done,
and by So mych the lordshupe of al men he gette.  The hardy
hath grete Sufferaunce, bonerte, Stabilnes, and verite, and
therfor he chargyth not of preysynge ne of myspreysynge, for hit is
a grete noun certayne of good renoune, that a man Putte hym of
anothyr manys mouthe to be Praysid.  For by Speche of the
Pepille, a coward may be as Prowos as Ector of troi.  Natheles,
as is afore in this boke declarid, in foreyne gouernaunce a prynce
sholde desyre and gete good renoune, by obeysaunce to god, and
in Vyse gouernance of his speche to godis wirchippe and profite
of the Pepille, and for no bobaunce as dyuers men dothe, whych
yewyth yeftys to Rymoris whyche Praysythe <MILESTONE N="49b" UNIT="folio">Hy&mmacr; Beste that
moste Ham yewyth.  Eeuery Wyse man, as a poet Sayth,
oftetymes sholde Enquere whate that the Pepill of hym spekyth,
<FOREIGN><HI REND="b">Sepius inquiras quid de te fama loquatur</HI></FOREIGN>, that is to Say,
"Enquere thow ofte-tymes what thynge is hit that fame Spekyth

<pb N="177" ID="pb.177" >
of the."  Kynge Alexander was callid of many a man that hym
losengit, 'Iupiter, the grete god'; but he wyste we&llbar; that thay
lied.  And therof happid in a tyme that he assieget a Cite, his
hoste makid therto assaute, The Cytteseynes ham defendid,
Alexandyr was woundid in the thegh, but he wolde not departe
fro the hoste, tille the assaute was fulfillid.  aftyr, he lyght fro
his hors and in Softe laghynge Sayde, "This wounde shewyth
wel that I is not god, but a dedly man, for hit grewyth me sore."
Abow al thynge lowed Prynces in olde tyme the commyn prowe
and the auctoricement of the Pepill, and therfor thay soght not
riches ne tresures to har owyn prow, but for the commyn prowe,
ne delycate <MILESTONE N="37bL" UNIT="folio">mettes ne drynkes thay soght not, but als lytill as
thay myght; And more for othyr men than for ham-Selfe.  And
therfor as me-thynkyth the grete abstynence that oure Irys&hbar;
enemys Supportyth in mettes and drynkes, is moche the cause
that thay in were often-tymes haue thare Purpos.  For of a
gouernoure of Rome tellyth Valery, that Marcus Curius was
callid a man of grete witte, hardy and Chiualerous, and wel
gouernede the Empire.  to hym came messangers of a grete
Cite, and hy&mmacr; founde Sittynge by a fyre vpon a lytill chaire,
ettynge of a tren dysshe, and hym Prait, yf hit were his
Plesynge endeynet to rescewe a grete Some of golde, that thay had
broght hym for har lordis.  This worthy lorde began to smothe
lagh, and answarid, "Say ye to youre lordys that hedyr you
sende, that Marcus Curius hath leuer to comaunde riche men
than be ryche; witte ye that y shall not be corruptid by
frendshup, enemyte, nethyr by golde, ne by Siluer."  For as Valery
Sayth, "euery good Emperoure loueth bettyr to be Powere in a
ryche Empire, than be riche in a pouer Empire."  And Seynte
Austyne Sayth, "that more is to playne that the Pouerte of
the Empire of Rome is Perishit, than the riches: For whyle
that the Prynces were Pouer the Pepill was riche, and when the
Prynces were riche the  Pepill was Pouer."  And therfor as vs
tellyth Eutropias, in the Stories of Romanes, That constance the
Emperoure in al his tyme desirid to make his Pepill riche, and
more-ouer, the same clerke vs tellyth, that bettyr is that riches
be in the handys of many men, than they in oone Place be
enclosyd; for the richere that the Pepill be, In So myche thay
may ham-Selfe the bettyr defende, and therto thay haue the
bettyr talent.  And who-so lytyll hath, the lasse talente hath;

<pb N="178" ID="pb.178" >
And therfor yf the <MILESTONE N="38L" UNIT="folio">Prynce Empoueryth the Pepill, he may
haue the lasse truste that the Pepill will helpe hym wyth
good will.  All the entente of good Prynces that euer were,
was to mayntene the prowe of the commyn pepill, for in that
dede thay trysted the bettyr to be lyke oure lord <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="folio">god, Kyng
of al Kynges, that al creaturis gouernyth aftyr Hare degre.
Therfore by gret study the lawes weryn stabelid and
maynteny&dtail;, Marchaundises vsed, Dyuers moneis contreuet, and al
that myght bene y-sayde that good was, al was Purveyet to
the comyn Profite of the Pepill, and not to make riche the
Prynces; that wittnessyth al bokis that tretyth of Empires or
realmes.  Tully askyth, "yf the Sone shall Spare the fadyr yf
<note ID="note.81" ><FOREIGN>De patrie per amorem</FOREIGN>, MS.</NOTE>he do any thynge agaynes the commyn Profite of the Contre."
Therto he hym-selfe answarith, "That fryst the Sone shall pray
the fadyr, that he wythdrawe hym, and yf he will not he shall
trete hym, and aftyr yf nede be, he shal acuse hym, and more
shall will that his fadyr be slayne, than the comyn Prowe of the
contre and the Peese be distourbet."  Of grete abstynence were
this olde Prynces, ffor at noone tyme he may be chyualryous, he
that Is a glotoune.  O&ftee; this we redyth in gestis of Romanys,
that Cesar auguste, lorde of al the worlde was of grete
abstynence; he nad noo cure delicate mettis, but helde hym appayed
of commyn brede, and grete fleshis, and chese of the bugle, for
he wolde not yeue ensampill of delytes to chyualrie.  Glorie,
honoure, and noblesse, more desyryth prynces in olde tyme, than
hepis of golde, Siluer, or precious stonys.  Ensamples of thes
ben grete plente, but Sortely to passe ouer, hit suffichyth that
in the stories of Romanes we fyndyth y-writte, that oone forcible
kynge of grete Pouer, assiget the Cite of Rome.  Cruel assautes
therto makyd; <MILESTONE N="38bL" UNIT="folio">Grete nombyr of Pepill he had Slayne, wherfor
out of mesure he was dreddid and dowted.  the Sinatouris of the
Cite that hadd the Pepill to kepe aforsid har consaille, moche
thay peynyd ham to contreue how thay myght ouercome the
tyraunt, and the Sige a-way Putte tha longe tyme dured.  Atte
that tyme in a Pasture wythout the Cite was a kepere of Mulis,
that Romanes callid a mulion.  this Mulion euery day be-helde
the hostis, he rewardid har battaille, he deuysed har armes, hare
contenaunces, and hare out-Passynges, herly and late, and Saw
the kynge ofte-tymes goynge out of his tentis priueli to go to

<pb N="179" ID="pb.179" >
sege; he knew hym well by Sertayn tokenys.  The Mulion hym
Sawe in a day by-cause of goynge to pryuely fer fro his men,
thedyr besili he hastid; thes carle was stronge in armes, the
kynge wyth grete streynth he caght, and hym trused hym before
on his Mule.  he hastid fast in his way, and neuer cessid tille
he came to the Capitolle; ther as the Senatours weryn atte
consaille, he smote atte the dore and askyd entre.  The Po[r]terys
haddyn of hym grete endeyne, there hym lefte, Vp thay went,
his message thay did.  the Senatours were grewid to be
destowrbete for a carle.  Atte the laste sayd on Senatoure, "we sholde
not haue despite of the Carle, we know not whate thythynges he
hath broght.  For but he hadd sume grete message, he ne were
not bolde to come hedyr."  And so by commyn assente the carle
hadde entre.  a fayre Presente he shewid, the kynge of barbrie
he hame <MILESTONE N="50b" UNIT="folio">presentid, to done thar will Wyth Hy&mmacr;.  The barbrions
Had Har Kynge loste, hit was no wondyr thegh thay espaunted
were; the Romanes ham army&dtail; faste.  The barbrions were
encumberid, thay Soght har kynge, he myght <MILESTONE N="39L" UNIT="folio">not be founde,
they turned har backys, but lytill ham a-vayillid; the Romanes
ham Suet, they smote, they hewyn and Slowen, and home
repairet wyth grete victorie; golde, siluer, precious stones, riche
clothis, and grete nobeldi wyth ham bare into the cite; thay
Slow the kynge, and So they makyd a good ende of the were.
Aftyr this the Senatours bethoght whate rewarde sholde thay
yewy&nmacr; the Mulion; thay callid hym forth, Golde, Siluer, and
othyr auauncement hym proferi&dtail;, and hym askyd wherof he
hym wolde be content for his good Service.  He answarid as
manfull and hardy man, that more lowid honoure than riches
that Sone Passyth: "Of golde ne syluer I ne haue no cure,
Graunt me oone thynge and that me Suffisyth.  Do ye," sayde
he, "make an ymage of brasse of my lickenesse, and a coronet
kynge ouercome by me." thay did So, and Sette the ymage
amyd the strete, that al pepill that ther went myght haue
remembraunce of that victorie.  Therfor aristotle Sayth, that
"honoure is the moste hey thynge that a man haue in this
worlde."  To the hardy hit appartenyth to be slow of mewynge,
but whan he shal battail in honde take, he is so ferce that he
dreddyth no man.  In the stories of Romanes we redyth, that
Tyberius the Emperoure of Rome in al his dedis was taryynge,
and wythout ripe consaille nothynge he did&dtail; that bare burthyn,

of his pryue men, why he so did: he answarid and Sayde, that

So is hit in the same manere of new officers, that like ben to

<P>hItte is to witte that thegh mekenys is necessary to al men,
hnamely hit is in Prynces.  Therof hit is to witte that go&dtail;
<MILESTONE N="51" UNIT="folio">ordeynet the fryste Prynce of His Pepill, Moysen the
whyche was Hardy, a ful meke man abow al men that in Erthe

<pb N="181" ID="pb.181" >

Prynce appartenyth to mekenesse, in vengeaunce-takynge of the
wrongis that byth y-do to hym-Selfe.  For lyke as hit be-fallyth
not to a manful man to be liberall of anothyr manes goode, but

noght in his Pepill lost-is for-yewynge, but in his owyn noght

honoure, glorie, and Perpetuel virchippe, is to the Prynce,
namely in redressynge by force of Pouer and lawe, the wronges
that ben done to the comyn Pepill and his subiectes, by enemys,
thewis, And othyr extorcioners.  That a prynce sholde be
Paciente and meke, Seneca Puttyth oo&nmacr;e ensampill and tellyth,
that the bee is a Passynge wrathfull beste and full of fyght,
and for vengeaunce they lewyth thar Styngill in the wonde, but
the kynge of bees Is wythout a styngill.  this is a kyndely
nobelesse of the vnreysonabill creature, yewynge essampill to al

fynde writte of the lyon, that thegh a man haue hym Sore
hurte, and than he that hym hurte falle doun to the Erthe, as
he wolde cry hym mercy, he wil hym not dyssayse in nothynge.
Therfor Iulyus Cesar for-yawe lyghtely nothynge Saue the

hym answerid neuer, nethyr Vengeanse therof toke.  We redyth
of thys Emperoure that a man by ewill will hym callid,
"Tyraunt"; and he answerid, "yf y were a tyraunte, thow
sholdyst Say no more so;" and Sothe hit was, for he myght haue

The Vise Poete Caton Sayth, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">Vtilius regno, meritis adquirere

kyngedome, by good deservynge frendis to gette."  But So did
not Dermot Mcmurg&hbar;, Prynce of leynystere, whych is the ve
parte of Irlande, For a gret Clerke, Richard Cambrensis that
makyd the Story of the conqueste by kynge Henry the Seconde
in Irland, tellyth that this Dermot in the begynnyge of his
regnacioune, he was an oppressoure and an extorcionere of vertues
men, and a crowel Tyraunt ontollerabill, vpon the grete lordis
of his londe.  Anothyr myschefe hym befell, O'rooryckes wyfe,
kynge of Mythe, by hyr owy&nmacr; assente, in abscence of hyr lorde,
he rauysshed.  And for-why that, for the more Partie al
myschefe, witnessynge olde stories many, and newe also, the wiche
by women began.  This kynge O'rorike, mor for shame than for
the hurte heyly grewid, wox al venomowsly wrothe.  And
therfor he gaderid many strangeris, that is to say, Rourike of
Connaght, that tyme kynge of Irlande, whyth his Pepill and
his owyn, A-vengid to be&nmacr;e.  Than the grete lordis of laynyster,
Seynge har Prynce i-Putte to myschefe, and in euery Partie
vmbesegid wyth enemys, olde wronges that he hadd done ham
thay rehersid; thay rose al atte onys wyth his enemys, And So
fortvne and his Pepill hym lefte atte ones.  Than this Prynce
Dermot, Seynge hym-Selfe on euery Side besieget, wythout
helpe and fououre, and hugely ouersette with enemys, aftyr
many Sore battaillis, to the laste remedy, he flow ouer the See
into Normandy in the parties of Fraunce, to kynge henry the
Seconde aforsayde, and hym besely besoght of Socoure.  He
was <MILESTONE N="41L" UNIT="folio">wirchiphully rescewid of the kynge, and hym his gouernaunce

<pb N="183" ID="pb.183" >  tolde.  Whan the kynge hadd herde the cause of his
comynge, he rescewid of hym the bonde of Subieccioun, and
fewtee, and hym toke his letteris of bienvoillaunce wher-by he
broght Pouer of Englyss&hbar;-men, Normanes, and Walschemen into
laynystere, the whyche wyth that othyr fowre Parties of the
londe by the Same kynge henry was for the more Partie
I-conquerid.  Thus did this Prynce Dermot hy&mmacr;-Selfe and al othyr
Prynces of his Nacio&nmacr; in lond for euer encombre by oppressyo&nmacr;.
<MILESTONE N="52" UNIT="folio">And therfor Hit Is more Sure to euery Prynce to comaunde

Clerke Cambrens tellyth in the Same story, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">Expedit subiectis

"Hit Is Spedful to euery Prynce radyr to be ylowid, than to be

So that of loue radyr than of correccio&nmacr; that drede confortyth.
For whate-euer man is y-lowid, hit semyth that he is dreddid.
But euery Extorcioner Is hatid of the commyn Pepill, and he that
hatid Is of the commyn Pepill, he shal be vnsocowrid whan he
moste nede hath, lyke as Dermot the Prince was.  I fynde In a
Sermonde writte, that an extorcionere is wors than the deuyll.
For the deuyll takyth in prei and turmentyth but corsyd men,
And the extorcioner rubbyth and Preyeth good men and trew;
And therfor the Deuil may Iustifye hym in rewarde of
extorcioner, For the Deuyl may Say to god, "I haue turmentid oonly
tho men that the haue hatid, but this extorcionere hath
turmentid tho men that the lowid."  And So we may vndyrstonde
that an extorcioner Is the deuyll-is angill, for thay ben sende
Into this worlde to do ther that thynge the wyche the deuyll
doth in helle, that Is to Say, to do turmentrie.

   betwen A man and his wif, And how he shold know and
   us hir temporaly.  Capitulum. xxxvi.</HEAD>
<P>The loue and the dred of almyghty god, maker and fourmer
of al thing, frust aboue al thing preferid, xije causes
enduceth a man to loue his wif reissonnabli and tempora[t]li.  The
furste caus is for that holy writ so bidith: <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Viri diligite
vxores vestras Sicut et Christus dilexit ecclesiam et Semet
ipsum tradidit pro ea"</HI></FOREIGN>: That is to sey: "O ye men, loue your
wywis as crist lowith holy church, And hymself yaw for hit."
Therfor a man shold loue the helth of his wif bodely and
gostely; for why: criste diet for the helth of mannes Soull and
remissioun of his Sin, And therfor a man shold merciably
fforyew his wif repentaunt veraily hir trespace.  Vppon this matier
Seint Austeyn saith <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Cur enim ad huc reputamus adulteros
quos credimus penitencia esse sanatos."</HI></FOREIGN>  That is to sey &mdash;
"Why shold whe now hold men adulteours which whe trowith
with repentaunce I-maked hole."  The Secound caus that shold
enduce a man to loue his wif is, for hir body is the body of hir
spous, And therfor he shold loue hir body as his owyn bodi, for
the wif hath no pouer of hir owyn body.  The iije caus ys that
non of tham ys Sufficiant to bring forth fruyt alon of
Ieneracioun.  The iiij<HI REND="sup">e</HI> caus is that woman of manys Ribe was fourmyt;
God wold not fourm woman of the Slyme as he dud man, but
of manys fleshe and bon, that he shold loue hir as him Self;
ffor holi writ saith, "whoso lowith his wif he lowith himself."
The ve caus is that a <MILESTONE N="47L" UNIT="folio">Man be-hettith woman loue when he Set
the Ring on hir fynger, and at mas in presence of cristes body
he doth kis hir.  The Sixt caus is that they ar cossinis both
of man and woman, for the vedlak louene euery ethir, And
therfor hit is wonder sethyn So many for ham lowen othir that

<pb N="192" ID="pb.192" >
thay hamself shold discord; ffor ofte tymys two realmes for on
matremony is broght to on accord.  The vije caus is that a wif
leuith fadir modir and all hir kyn, and anheyrryth to hir
spous, And therfor he doth ontreueli but yef he hir loue.  The
viije caus is that but yef they loue both othir thay shall be in
gret myssais, for lik as a man ne restith not well vndir a
dropping hous, namely in cold tym, So a man restith not with
his wif yf contencion be tham betwen.  The Philosofre saith,
<FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Vxor est aut perpetuale refugium aut perhenne
tormentum"</HI></FOREIGN>: That is to sey, "A wif is a perpetuall refuyt, Othir an
euerlesting tormenty." the ixe caus is that hit is hugeli
pleasant to god, and man loue wedlak; for Salamon Saith, "In
thre thingis my spirit is pleassit, that ben aprowid afor god and
man; that is to sey the accord in brethereth, loue of
negheboris, And man and his wif well togeddir assentyng."  The xe
caus is that a wif is a solas to a man of godis yefte, And therfor
Salamon saith, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Ve Soli"</HI></FOREIGN>; That is to sey, "Woo to hym that
is allon."  But he is not allon that livith in chastite, as oneste
maidenys and widowis vnto the worshup of god.  But a
fornicatour is hold allon which is acursid of god, that whan he seth
and covettith a woman fleshely, his dissolacion Radir &thorn;an <MILESTONE
N="47bL" UNIT="folio">his
consolacioun he seth; he seth the swerd with the which the
dewill hym kittith and fro god hym departith.  The xie caus
that a wif is lik an ornement of an houshold; ffor Salamon
saith, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Sicut sol oriens in mundo in altissimo dei, Sic
mulieris bone species in ornamentis domus eius, et mulier
diligens corona<note ID="note.91" >corana, MS.</NOTE> est viro sou"</HI></FOREIGN>; that ys to sey, "As the son
ryssing in the world in the heghest placis of god, So is the
fairnys of the woman gode in the ornamentis of hir hous; And
a lowing woman ys a croun to hir spous."  And Salamon,
speking of fairnys, saith, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Sapiens non corporis sed anime
respisit decorem."</HI></FOREIGN>  That is to sey, "A wise man beholdith
not the fairnys of the body but of the soull."  And a fole in
flesly thyngis is ouer-taken.  The xije caus is that the sacrament
of matremony is a dingnite ordeyned of god and in paradis afor
that euer enny syn was wroght.  And therfor crist in the
gospell saith, <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Quod deus coniunxit homo non separet"</HI></FOREIGN>;

<P>HIt ys to wit that matremony ys to be commendid for many
caussis, and in exspeciall at this tym for ve; fruste for the
auctorite of almyghty god, ordyner of matremony; <MILESTONE N="48L" UNIT="folio">And for honor
of the place that hit was maked In; ffor thereas Seint benet

all the world was dront, only he sawid the ordir of matremoney.
In Noes ship he and his wif, har thre sonys and har wiffis
sawid were, but all the lechurreris and concubynes were drond.
The iiij<HI REND="sup">e</HI> caus is for criste Ihesus and his modir Seint Mari and

cheldryn to ben concewid, and to the wirship of god to be

This is the principall caus and office of the werk of matrimony.
The ije caus is whan that the work is don for remedy, that is to
wit to enchu fornicasion.  The iije caus is whan det is payed to
the asker; vppon the which matier Seint Austeyn saith thus:

<pb N="194" ID="pb.194" >
<FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"Redde debitum coniugale nullus est criminis.  In hoc

iiij<HI REND="sup">e</HI><note ID="note.92" >MS. iije.</NOTE> case Is whan a man asketh that worke to mak his wif,
that she fal not in sin; as whan a man knowing his wif
shamfaste and neuer to ask that dette, and he dredith of hir
fallyng in Syn, he asketh that dette.  In this casse pite meuyth.
But sothely yef a man use that work to fulfill his concupiscens
ther is sin, othir while venyall syn and othir whill dedely
syn; hit is veniall sine whan concupiscence is so ferforth

wer his wif; hit is dedly syn whan that concupiscens Is so
vnmessurable that he wold knov hir thegh she wer not his wif.
Also hit is to wit that a worthy clerk, Iohn of Burghe, in a
bok which he maked, that is calit in latteyn <FOREIGN><HI REND="b">"pupilla occuli

that the fryste Parte of the Profite of euery good worke, as
Parisiens Sayth, is glorie appertenynge to oure lorde go&dtail;, And
ther-for the apostil sayth, "Honoure and glorie bene they vnto
you, oonly god."  The ije cause Is, that the Seconde Parte of
the Profite of euery good werke Is good ensampill, appertenynge
vnto oure neghbore; And therfor cryste in the gospel of Matheu

<pb N="205" ID="pb.205" >
Sayth, "Youre lyght so lyght afore men that thay mowen See

vnto hy&mmacr; that dooth good workys.  And therfor he that Sechyth
his owyn glori of good workes that he doth, he defraudyth god
of his Parte of the profite, and ther-for barnar vp this vers,
<FOREIGN><HI REND="b">Scuto circundabit te veritas eius,</HI></FOREIGN> etc, Sayth, that vayn glorie
Is an arow of the deuyll that Is to drede, fleynge lyghtly in thy
lyfe-day, but hit makyth a full heuy and a full Soore wounde.
The iiij<HI REND="sup">e</HI> cause why that this nobill erle sholde not haue vayne
glory of this forsayde proesses is, the lytill thanke that he had
of <MILESTONE N="57L" UNIT="folio">ham that hym shuldyn beste haue rewardid and commendid.
And ther-for this nobill erle may Sey that, that the appostill
Sayde vnto thymothe, "know thou," he Seyth, "that in the
latyste dayes ther shullyn be Perillous tymes, And men Shullyn
be lowynge ham-Selfe, couetous, Prowte, heygh, claundrynge,

<P>cErtayne thynge hit is that the Sowle whyche Is the fourme

For in al this Passions of the body, the Sowle and the corage
ham chaungyth.  And kynde is so grete a fellowe betwen body
and Sowle, that the Passyons of body chaungyth the sowle; and
the Passions of Sowle, chaungyth <MILESTONE N="66L" UNIT="folio">the body.  And that apperyth
in the Passione of Dronknesse, whyche is bodely.  For

In the Same manere may we Showe the contrary, that is to
