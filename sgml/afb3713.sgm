<P>FOR alle werkis of Crist ben good lore to Cristen men, to teche hem how &thorn;ei shal lyve for to gete &thorn;e blisse of hevene, &thorn;erfore &thorn;is gospel of Crist telli&thorn; how he bi bo&thorn;e his kyndis did a miracle of mercy in fedynge of &thorn;e nedy folk. <I>Whan myche peple was wi&thorn; Jesus, and &thorn;ei hadden not to ete, he clepide his disciplis togidere and seide, Y have ru&thorn; upon &thorn;e peple, for &thorn;ei have sued me &thorn;ree daies, and now &thorn;ei han not for to ete, and if Y lete hem go fastinge home, &thorn;ei shal faile in &thorn;e weye, for sum of hem comen fro ferre. And his disciplis seiden to him, Whereof my&yogh;te a man fede &thorn;is folk here in &thorn;is waste place? And Crist axide hem, how many loves &thorn;at &thorn;ei hadden, and &thorn;ei seiden seven. And Crist commandide &thorn;e peple to sitte doun on &thorn;e er&thorn;e; and takynge &thorn;es sevene loves and doinge &thorn;ankingis to God, he brak hem, and &yogh;af hise disciplis to putt to &thorn;e puple, and &thorn;ei &yogh;aven &thorn;is breed to &thorn;e puple. And &thorn;ei hadden a fewe litil fishis, and hem he blesside and makide his disciplis &yogh;yve hem to &thorn;e peple. And &thorn;e peple eet, and was fulfillid; and &yogh;it &thorn;ei gedriden seven berlepis</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">That is, 'carrying-baskets,' from the A.S. 'beran,' to bear, and 'leap,' a basket.

In &thorn;e first weren fyve &thorn;ousaund fedde, and in &thorn;e to&thorn;ir foure &thorn;ousand, and &thorn;is was &thorn;e seconde feste, as seint Mark telli&thorn;.

And so curatis &thorn;at ben better occupied about spiritual nedis shulden for &thorn;er feblenesse, fer fro state of innocence, take bodily almes to perfourme &thorn;er office, &yogh;he &yogh;if &thorn;ei ben stronge in bodi in reward of o&thorn;er men; and &thorn;is title of almes is mooste acording to preestis; but in state of innocens shulde &thorn;is almes be awey; for men shulde have redily fruyt &thorn;at &thorn;ai hadden nede of; and &thorn;is feblenesse of bodi is falle to men for synne. Crist &thorn;at was bo&thorn;e God and man hadde not &thorn;is feblenes, for he my&yogh;t have mete whan and wher he wolde; but we shal wite &thorn;at our Jesus Crist dide more miracle, and bad hise disciplis serve &thorn;e puple at &thorn;e mete, to teche us &thorn;at we ben myn|ystris and not autouris of miracle. And &thorn;us he quykide Lazarus, and made his apostolis efte to lose him, to teche &thorn;at he for&yogh;eve&thorn; &thorn;e synne, and his vikeris shewen it to &thorn;e puple.

We shal see moreover 
<PB REF="00000055.tif" N="19"> &thorn;at &thorn;e folke &thorn;at Crist fedde here weren fedde comounly, and not by maner of &thorn;is world, for to dampne riche mannis maneris &thorn;at feden hemsilf coostly, and ordeyne strange and likerous mete, and in greet multitude, and excuse hem herbi &thorn;at relif goi&thorn; to pore men, for pore men my&yogh;ten many mo be beter fedde wi&thorn; comoun metis; and so &thorn;is is a likerous pride, how|ever we gabben to God.

And o&thorn;ir servauntis of &thorn;is man, whan &thorn;ei seyen &thorn;is dede, mourneden ful myche, and tolden al &thorn;is to &thorn;e lord.

<P>&THORN;e kyngdom of hevene is holy Chirche, of men, &thorn;at now traveilen here; and &thorn;is Chirche bi his heed is lyke to a man kyng, for Crist, heed of &thorn;is Chirche, is bo&thorn;e God and man. &THORN;is kyng wolde ryken wi&thorn; his servantis, for Crist ha&thorn; wille wi&thorn;outen ende to rykene wi&thorn; men at &thorn;re tymes.

And so Crist for|&yogh;eve&thorn; hem upon &thorn;is condicioun. But &thorn;ei wenden out, and suen not Crist &thorn;er lord in mercy, but oppressen &thorn;er servauntis &thorn;at owen &thorn;em but a litil dette, and putten hem in prisoun, and &thorn;enken not on Goddis mercy; and o&thorn;ir servantis of God bo&thorn;e in &thorn;is lyf and in &thorn;e to&thorn;ir tellen to God &thorn;is felnes, and preien him of venjance.

<P>Here men may touche &thorn;e malice of ypocrisie, for &thorn;ere is no wers synne, ne more general, ne more venymous; for it is more yvel &thorn;at it &thorn;us contrarie&thorn; to treu&thorn;e, si&thorn; an ypocrite feyne&thorn; him holy, and he is a fals fend.

Je|rome, and the Venerable Bede, nor in the Homilies of Pope Gregory, which throws the smallest light up|on it. Upon turning however to the Commentary of Nicholas de Lyra, written in the early part of the four|teenth century, I found some words which, I think, solve the difficulty. Distinguishing this Bethany (Beth|abara in the authorized version) from the one near Jerusalem, De Lyra de|scribes it as lying beyond the Jordan, 'scilicet in sorte duarum tribuum et dimidiae;' i. e. Reuben and Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Wyclif probably meant to say the same thing, but inadvertently omitted mention of the half-tribe, of which indeed very slight notice is taken in the account (Numb. xxxii.) of the negotiation between Moses and the 'lynages' (Wycl. Ver.) of Reuben and Gad.</NOTE>; and so men seyen &thorn;at &thorn;er ben two Be&thorn;anies in &thorn;at lond, oon biside Jerusalem where Lazarus was reisid to lyf, and ano&thorn;er bi&yogh;onde &thorn;e water <I>where Joon</I> hadde mater <I>to baptise men.</I> For Be&thorn;anie<NOTE PLACE="foot">Bethany signifies 'house of dates.'

<P>&THORN;IS gospel telli&thorn; how Crist was temptid &thorn;re tymes of &thorn;e fend, and how he overcam &thorn;e fend, to teche us, how we shulde do. &THORN;e storye telli&thorn; &thorn;at <I>Jesus was ladde of &thorn;e Holy Goost in to &thorn;e desert</I> sone after his fastynge, <I>to be temptid of &thorn;e fend.</I> For &thorn;e fend tempti&thorn; men, whan he supposi&thorn; &thorn;at &thorn;ei ben moost feble. &THORN;e fend supposid &thorn;is of Crist <I>whan he hadde fastid fourty daies</I>, and resouns of &thorn;e fend, where Crist was bo&thorn;e God and man, marrid him so &thorn;at he wiste nevere where &thorn;is was so&thorn; or fals. And &thorn;is coveitide he to wite, for &thorn;anne he wolde have lettid men to do Crist &thorn;us to &thorn;e de&thorn;, lest he savyde mankynde. It was not pleyne to &thorn;e fend &thorn;at Crist was God for &thorn;is fastynge. For Moyses and Ely bo&thorn;e fastiden fully fourty daies, and &yogh;it nei&thorn;er of hem was God, as &thorn;e fend wiste wel. But Jesus bi his manere of fastinge passide bo&thorn;e Moyses and Hely. For Crist fastide fourty daies, and nei&thorn;er ete ne drank in &thorn;is tyme, and he was in quyke age, and listide wel to ete, and he was not occupied on o&thorn;er|wise as &thorn;es two weren. Moyses was in &thorn;e mount wi&thorn; God, and fed wi&thorn; him in al &thorn;is tyme. Hely was an oold man, and fedde wi&thorn; drede of &thorn;e kyng. But Jesus was a &yogh;onge man, and fourty daies lyvede wi&thorn; beestis, and suffrid of God for to hungre more &thorn;an ony o&thorn;er dide. And so Crist passide bo&thorn;e &thorn;es two and Joon Baptist wi&thorn; hem, al &yogh;if he lyvede after comoun lyf to &yogh;yve ensaunple to his Chirche, but Baptiste lyvede more comounly peynful lyf &thorn;an dide Crist.</P>
<P>&THORN;e fend bigan to tempte first Crist at pryde and glotonye, for him &thorn;ou&yogh;t bi &thorn;es two he shulde sounest overcome Crist. <I>&THORN;is tempter seide</I> &thorn;us to Crist, <I>&yogh;if &thorn;ou be Goddis sone, sey &thorn;at &thorn;es stones be maad loves</I>, for &thorn;e fend wiste wele &thorn;at &thorn;is my&yogh;te God li&yogh;tly have do, for Crist dide more wounder whan he made &thorn;is world of not, and whan he fed so many folk wi&thorn; fyve loves and fewe fishes, as &thorn;e fend wiste wele after, but &yogh;it &thorn;is was hidde

And so &thorn;e fend was a fool whan he temptide Crist &thorn;us. But Crist answeride wisely, and for to &yogh;yve men ensaumple to answere bi Goddis lawe, and to love more it &thorn;an er&thorn;ely &thorn;ing.&mdash;A sophistre wolde denye &thorn;is resoun &thorn;at &thorn;e fend made to Crist, but he coude not teche &thorn;us &thorn;at Goddis word is more to love &thorn;an ony er&thorn;ely mete, and so it shulde not be lefte &thorn;erfore. And &thorn;us &yogh;if we can answere covenably bi Goddis lawe whan &thorn;at we ben temptid of pryde, of glotonye or o&thorn;er synne, we may wel overcome &thorn;e fend and ech &thorn;ing &thorn;at tempti&thorn; us &thorn;us.

And here men passen foly of &thorn;e fend.

But &thorn;us &thorn;e fend temptide not Crist, al &yogh;if he were of more power &thorn;an ben &thorn;es Antecristis disciplis to tempte Crist or Cristen men.

And whan Jesus cast up his ei&yogh;en, and saw a ful grete multitude was comen to him, he seide unto Philip, Wherof shal we bigge looves, &thorn;at &thorn;es men ete. And &thorn;is seide Crist to tempte Philip, for he wist what he was to do. And Philip seide to Crist &thorn;at looves of two hundrid pens suffiden not to hem, &thorn;at ech man take a litil what. And oon of Cristis disciplis, Andrew, Petris bro&thorn;er, seide to Crist, &thorn;er was a child &thorn;at hadde fyve barly loves and two fishes, but what ben &thorn;es among so many men? And Jesus seide to hem, to make hem sitte doun to &thorn;e mete, for &thorn;ere was myche hay in &thorn;e same place; and so &thorn;ei sate</I>

<P>&THORN;is bodily fode bi whiche Crist fedde &thorn;e folc, bitokene&thorn; goostly foode bi whiche he fede&thorn; mankynde. His passynge over &thorn;is water with his disciplis, is passyng over worldely perilis to take Goddis lore.

<P>And here men moven &thorn;re doutis. First, how Criste absentide him fro Jerusalem at &thorn;is Paske, si&thorn; Baptiste hertely reprovede Heroud, and Crist was more hardy &thorn;an Joon for to suffre passioun for &thorn;e love of mankynde. But here we trowen &thorn;at Jesus, si&thorn; he was bo&thorn;e God and man, dide alle his dedis at point devys, and my&yogh;te no wey be amendid. And &thorn;us he absentide him now to prophite<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>profite</I>, B, C, E.</NOTE> more to his Chirche, for his tyme was not come to die at &thorn;e Paske, &thorn;at he hadde ordeyned. For, as men seyen comounly, Crist moste passe &thorn;is secounde Paske, and in &thorn;e &thorn;ridde Paske die gladly for mankynde. And so Crist suffride more freely &thorn;an Baptist or o&thorn;er martiris. But he was more nedid bi wisdom to suffre as him silfe had cast, and so, as Crist himsilfe hadde ordeyned, Baptist shulde die bifore, and so go to purgatorye and be taken out bi Crist. And &thorn;us Crist &yogh;af ensaumple to us to fle de&thorn;, whan he move&thorn; us, as al his lyf was ensaumple to teche men how &thorn;ei shal lyve. &THORN;e secounde doute is axid here, whi Crist wolde not take &thorn;e rewme of Judee &thorn;at was owid to him, si&thorn; &thorn;e puple preferide him anoon, aftir &thorn;is myracle &thorn;at Crist had fedd &thorn;us &thorn;e folk. But here men seyen, as to &thorn;e first, &thorn;at it were a manere of biggynge to have &thorn;e rewme for suche a feste, and of puple &thorn;at was so symple. Also, al &yogh;if Crist was kyng, he wolde not &thorn;us regne worldely, ne him was owid no siche rewme, si&thorn; God wolde not &thorn;at it were so. Also Crist ordeynede him silfe to lyve wi&thorn;outen wronge of ony man, and so he wolde not regne &thorn;us wi&thorn;outen &thorn;e emperour's leve, &thorn;at men shulden wite &thorn;at his lyfe no weye reversid &thorn;e emperour. And so witnessis &thorn;at accusiden him in tyme of his dee&thorn; weren opynly fals. And &thorn;us as oure Lord forsoke to be preisid of &thorn;e fendis, so he forsoke now to take &thorn;e rewme &thorn;us of &thorn;is puple.&mdash;&THORN;e &thorn;ridde doute &thorn;at sue&thorn; &thorn;es two is, how Crist my&yogh;te disserven in suffringe of his passioun, si&thorn; he was nedid to suffre &thorn;us.

And for myche wilfulnesse was his passioun more medeful. And here &thorn;es blynde heretikes wanten witt as ydiotis, whan &thorn;ei seien &thorn;at Petre synnede not in smytynge of Malcus ere, but &yogh;af en|saumple to preestis to fi&yogh;t.

But here &thorn;es blynde heretikes, &thorn;at ben unable to conseyve sutilte of holy writt, shulden first lerne &thorn;er owen wordis. So&thorn; it is &thorn;at al &thorn;ingis mut nedis come as God hath ordeyned, and so ech dede of Crist muste nedis be done as he dide it. And &thorn;us &yogh;if men shulden not sue Crist here, for he muste nedis suffre, no Cristen man shulde sue Crist in no &thorn;ing &thorn;at he dide. For alle &thorn;e &thorn;ingis &thorn;at Crist dide musten nedely comen as &thorn;ei came, and so siche heritikes musten nede suen Antecrist and be dampnyd wi&thorn; him, for defaute of her bileve.

For this is clearly the meaning of Wyclif's words, and this was in fact the main point of his controversy with the friars on the Eucharistic mystery; in which he quarrelled with their definition of the consecrated species as an 'accident without a subject' for this very reason, that it utterly denied the co-presence of <I>bread</I> in any sense, after consecration. It is therefore a point of much interest to ascertain whether St. Austin's works really contain any passage which would justify the reference in the text; in other words, which would support Wyclif's favourite theory of consubstantiation; and I shall be glad if this note should be the means of directing the attention of theological students to the search.

The form was probably observed strictly enough all along; so that the preacher's words must be taken with some allowance. In turning over the pages of the Bullarium, I observe, under the year 1515, only two years before the first public appearance of Luther, the formal grant by Leo X of two indulgences, and in both cases the form of words is; &mdash; [Indulgemus] 'quod quilibet Christi fidelis . . . . . . plenariam omnium peccatorum suorum, <I>de qui|bus corde contritus, atque ore confessus fuerit</I>, indulgentiam et remissionem consequatur.'</NOTE>, for &thorn;ei killen &thorn;er evene cristene<NOTE PLACE="foot">The allusion is to Bishop Spen|cer's crusade.

Crist is moost lord of al, and &thorn;erfore he wole have dispit, but &yogh;if men axen him a greet &thorn;ing; ffor ellis his lordship and &thorn;at axing acorden not to his name. And so, &yogh;if &thorn;ou wilt axe in Cristis name, axe &thorn;e blisse &thorn;at evere shal laste; and si&thorn; Crist is treu&thorn;e and resoun, loke &thorn;i axinge be resonable, and &thorn;an maist &thorn;ou be sure to have &thorn;e &thorn;ing &thorn;at &thorn;ou axist &thorn;us. And herfore Crist in &thorn;is gospel biddi&thorn; us to axe oure ful joie, and &thorn;an shal we have it, if &thorn;at we axen it in resoun; for no man ha&thorn; but half joie, but &yogh;if he be ful of blisse. And &thorn;is greet lord wole not be axid but &thorn;is blisse, or menes &thorn;erto; and &yogh;if man axe &thorn;us in resoun &thorn;at he be wor&thorn;i to have it, he shal have it wi&thorn;outen doute whan best tyme were &thorn;at he hadde it; and he shal have on &thorn;e best manere &thorn;e &thorn;ing &thorn;at he axi&thorn; &thorn;us.</P>

<P>And bi &thorn;es wordis of witt Crist conforti&thorn; his children, and biddi&thorn; hem, &thorn;at <I>&thorn;er herte be not disturblid ne drede;</I> for who ever trowe&thorn; fully &thorn;is sentence &thorn;at is seid, and hopi&thorn; fully &thorn;at he were of nombre of &thorn;es children, he were an untrewe man &yogh;if &thorn;at he drede &thorn;us.

<HEADNOTE><P>[THE sermons which follow, on the gospels of the office of the Commune Sanctorum, are thirty-one in number. The order of the feasts, and the gospels themselves, appear to have been taken by the writer from the Sarum missal. Every separate office in|cluded in that missal is dealt with by the writer of the sermons except those for 'Many Virgins' and 'Holy Women not Virgins;' and for this omission there is an obvious reason, viz. that the gospels for those offices are the same as those for 'One Virgin not Martyr,' and 'One Virgin and Martyr,' and had therefore already formed the subjects of sermons. With one exception, all the gospels correspond with those in the Sarum missal. This exception is in the office for 'One Apostle.' Two gospels for this office are treated of by the writer, <I>Hoc est praeceptum</I>, (John XV. 12) and <I>Haec mando vobis</I>, (John XV. 17). The latter one of these gospels alone is given in the Sarum missal. But the <I>Hoc est praeceptum</I> is the gospel for the 'Vigil of an Apostle' in the present <I>Roman</I> missal.</P><P>Although of course there is a general agreement, the office of the Commune Sanctorum in the Sarum missal differs considerably from that of the present Roman missal. In one direction it is fuller, in another not so full. It is fuller, in that it has a greater number of distinct offices or masses, there being twenty-nine in the Sarum, and only twenty-four (including that for the anni|versary of the Dedication of a Church) in the Roman. It is less full, because, though it has more offices for several of the feasts, certain festivals are not represented in it at all, e.g. those of 'One Martyr not a Bishop,' and of a 'Martyr not Virgin.'</P><P>Out of the thirty-one gospels treated of by the writer, twenty|one are also found in the Commune Sanctorum of the Roman missal, and ten are different.]</P></HEADNOTE>

In Professor Rogers' valuable <I>History of Agriculture and Prices in England</I> (i. 217), I find it stated that in the fourteenth century, 'the following are years of famine, the average price of wheat having risen above 10s. the quarter:&mdash;1315, 1318, 1321, 1351, 1369.' Again,&mdash;'It rose above 9s. in 1294 and 1370:' 'above 8s. in 1293, 1314, 1350, 1363, 1367, 1374, 1390.' In the years 1381-1386, with|in which these sermons must have been composed if Wyclif was their author, the price of wheat was re|markably low. These statistics refer to the southern and midland coun|ties, and are thoroughly reliable. Either then, if Wyclif wrote the ser|mon, the reference must have been to a time of scarcity as far back as 1374; or, if we suppose the scarcity of 1390 to be pointed at, Wyclif was not the author of the sermon.</NOTE>. <I>&THORN;es ben bigynnynge of sorewis; and &thorn;erfore loke wel &yogh;ou silf, for &thorn;ei shall bitraie &yogh;ou in her coun|ceilis, and in her sinagogis shal &yogh;e be betyn; and bifore kyngis and justices shal &yogh;e stonde, for me, in witnes to hem.

This is called by the writer, <I>accusing</I> the Court of teaching the said doctrine; because, as he goes on to say, Christ and many of the saints unmistakably taught <I>his</I> doctrine. He proceeds to suggest, apparently in the hope of setting himself right with the Court by appealing to its self-interest, that the existing hierarchy was terribly burdensome both to Court and na|tion, and that to 'stoppe first fruytis,' and other ecclesiastical exactions, would be greatly to the advantage of the state.

<P>&THORN;IS gospel techi&thorn; alle men how &thorn;at &thorn;ei shulden lyve to Crist, but speciali prelatis, &thorn;at shulden be li&yogh;t to &thorn;e peple. And so, for confessours kepten &thorn;is lore in her liif bifore o&thorn;er men, &thorn;er|fore &thorn;e Chirche redi&thorn; &thorn;is gospel whanne men seien of con|fessouris. First Crist biddi&thorn; to his disciplis, <I>&thorn;at her lendis be girdid bifore, and lanternes brennynge in her hondis, as &thorn;ei shulden bide her Lord whanne he come&thorn; a&yogh;en fro bridalis.</I> &THORN;es lendis &thorn;at Crist speki&thorn; of ben &thorn;e fleishli kynde joyned wi&thorn; &thorn;e soule. And &thorn;es lendis helpen &thorn;e spirit upon two maneres; and for &thorn;es two maneris &thorn;ei ben clepid lendis. &THORN;is fleish serve&thorn; to &thorn;e soule, suffringe as it shulde suffre, and doinge as it shulde do, whanne it is tau&yogh;t wel of &thorn;e soule. And &thorn;us sei&thorn; Poul<NOTE PLACE="foot">Compare Hebrews vii. 10, Gal. iii. 17. The writer of the sermon appears to have misunderstood the first of these passages.</NOTE>, &thorn;at Crist was in Abrahams lendis. And so Crist techi&thorn; here chastite, as Gregory sei&thorn;<NOTE PLACE="foot">S. Greg. Homilia xiii.

Brenn|ynge lanternes ben medeful workes &thorn;at men have in her vertue, bi whiche &thorn;ei shulden worche; and, for &thorn;es workes comen bo&thorn;e of bodi and of soule, &thorn;erfore &thorn;ei ben clepid of Crist two lanternes, and &thorn;ei ben in oure hondis whanne we worchen wi&thorn; hem. For it is not ynow&yogh; to kepe us fro synnes, but if we worken gode workes bi &thorn;es two lanternes.</P>
<P>But for &thorn;es bridalis, we shal wite &thorn;at &thorn;ei ben taken on many maneres; first for &thorn;e weddingis &thorn;at Crist is joyned wi&thorn; &thorn;e soule; after for &thorn;e dwellinge &thorn;at Crist dwelli&thorn; wi&thorn; &thorn;e soule; 
<PB REF="00000312.tif" N="276"> and &thorn;e &thorn;ridde for &thorn;e goostli fode &thorn;at soulis ben fed wi&thorn; Crist in blisse. And so &thorn;ei ben &thorn;ree weddingis &thorn;at Crist is weddid here; first whanne he toke mankynde, and made it oo persone wi&thorn; him; after whanne he taki&thorn; his Chirche, and maki&thorn; it oo spouse wi&thorn; him; &thorn;e &thorn;ridde wedding is particuler, whanne Crist taki&thorn; oo soule to him. And so Crist is seid to turne a&yogh;en fro bridalis on two maneris. First, whanne a man is deed &thorn;at Crist ha&thorn; ordeyned to come to blisse, Crist turne&thorn; a&yogh;en to his soule from dwelling wi&thorn; &thorn;e Chirche in hevene. But Crist leve&thorn; not &thorn;is Chirche, but on new manere dwelli&thorn; wi&thorn; &thorn;is soule. But &thorn;anne he must have dwelt bifore, or ellis &thorn;is soule cam not bi &thorn;is state. And so we shulden be liche to men &thorn;at abiden &thorn;e comynge of Crist, in tyme of de&thorn;, or &thorn;e dai of dome. And &thorn;is abiding shulde alle men marke, for &thorn;is comyng is uncertein, and &thorn;is tyme is perilous; si&thorn; &thorn;is drau&yogh;t mot be wel drawen &yogh;if oure liif shal ou&yogh;te profite. And so to &thorn;es comyngis of Crist shulde ech man make him redi; si&thorn; Crist shal come and knocke at doris, and entre to hem &thorn;at ben wakinge, and redi to resseyve Crist wi&thorn;outen sleping in synne. And &thorn;is openyng shal be doon anoon, as li&yogh;tnyng of sonne<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>sunne</I>, E.</NOTE> is in &thorn;e eir. And so Crist knocki&thorn; at oure doris whanne he techi&thorn; us signes of de&thorn;, or signe of &thorn;e dai of dome; but &thorn;e laste knockyng is sudeyne. &YOGH;if a man be redi bifore to dwellen wi&thorn; Crist wi&thorn;|outen ende, &thorn;anne he opene&thorn; to Crist, si&thorn; &thorn;is openyng is redy|nesse. And &thorn;us sei&thorn; Crist ful so&thorn;li, <I>&thorn;at &thorn;es servauntis ben blessid whiche, whanne &thorn;e Lord come&thorn;, he finde&thorn; &thorn;us wakinge. So&thorn;eli, Y seie to &yogh;ou, &thorn;at &thorn;is Lord shal girde him, and make hem sitte to mete, and passe and mynystre to hem.</I> &THORN;e sitting to mete of seintis, is confermyng of hem in blisse; &thorn;e passing of &thorn;is Lord bi hem is his shewing to oon and o&thorn;er. And al &yogh;if &thorn;is shewing be togidere, &yogh;it her taking is divers; and her diversite is signefied bi &thorn;is passing of Crist. &THORN;is service is li&yogh;t to Crist, for it is but Cristis shewing of his Godhede, and his manhede, in which seintis shal be fed.</P>
<P><I>And &yogh;if &thorn;is Lord come in &thorn;e secounde vigile, and eke in &thorn;e &thorn;ridde, and fynde sich redynesse in &thorn;es servantis, ful blessid ben &thorn;es servantis</I>, si&thorn; &thorn;ei anoon ben blessid of God. &THORN;es &thorn;re vigiles &thorn;at Crist telli&thorn;

Plutarch as|cribes to Plato the opinion that if there are more worlds than the one which we inhabit, there must be <I>five</I>, neither more nor less; and that, even if there be only one, that one may be considered as compounded out of five subordinate worlds,&mdash;the four elements, and the sky, or fifth essence, 'to which alone,' he says, 'amongst all bodies, the property of revolving in a circle naturally appertains.' The apparent revolution of the celestial sphere round the earth is evidently intended. Again, Sir Thomas Browne, in noticing the singular frequency of the quinary arrangement in nature, observes (it is a thing indeed which many have observed independently) upon the very large number of flowers which have <I>five</I> petals, as if that was the simplest and most fundamental division of a circle into sectors. 'Five-leaved flowers are commonly disposed circularly about the stylus, according to the higher geometry of nature, dividing a circle by five radii, which concur not to make diameters, as in quadrilateral and sexangular intersections.' (<I>Garden of Cyrus</I>, p. 526, ed. Bohn.) The next para|graph begins,&mdash;'Now the number of five is remarkable in every circle,' but as I cannot understand the rea|soning which follows, I forbear to quote it In a curious statement quoted by the editor of Browne from Mr. Colebrooke, it is clearly shown that the simplest distribution of groups of objects round a central and interior group is a <I>quinary</I> ar|rangement, while at the same time, when the groups come to be mul|tiplied indefinitely, it is necessarily spheroidal. The reader will remem|ber also the quinary grouping of animals by Mr. Macleay, once so famous, and the remarkable vindi|cation of the theory in the <I>Vestiges of the Natural History of the Creation.</I></NOTE>; and &thorn;e to&thorn;er fyve foolis shal be dampned in helle wi&thorn;outen eende.

<P>It were for to telle here how devocioun wanti&thorn; in clerkis; as popis taken &thorn;er stat here for a foule devocioun, to be wor|shipid in &thorn;is world and have moche of worldli lordshipe. And so done &thorn;es cardinalis and &thorn;es bishopis also. Curatis taken benefices for &thorn;e same cause, but lesse; and preestis taken her ordris for devocioun of ten mark<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><I>for devocioun of ten mark.</I>] This sounds like a phrase in common use at the time, as if one were to say now that a curate took orders for his &pound;100 a year. The passage is of some importance, as showing that, in spite of the efforts both of the court and the bishops to keep down the salaries of priests, the average rate of pay to a working priest, (the passage has nothing to do with the <I>parsons</I> of livings,) in the reign of Richard II, was ten marks, or &pound;6 13<I>s.</I> 4<I>d.</I> per annum. It may be as well to take this opportunity of putting together a few particulars respecting the salaries of non-bene|ficed clerks in England between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries.</P><P>A constitution of Stephen Lang|ton, dated in 1222, thus regulates the pay of vicars perpetual:&mdash;</P><P>'Statuimus, ut vicario perpetuo ad minus reditus quinque Marcarum as|signentur, qui scilicet pro quinque Marcis solet dari ad Firmam; nisi forte in illis partibus Walliae sit....' where the parish is too poor to afford so high a stipend.</P><P>Five marks then were esteemed a competent salary in the early part of the reign of Henry III. Nearly a century and a half later the standard had varied but very little. In a con|stitution of 1362 Archbishop Islep ordains that a priest simply cele|brating 'annals,' or masses by the year, for the repose of departed souls, shall be satisfied with five marks a year, but that if he have also cure of souls, he shall receive six marks. Following up this con|stitution, the act of 36 Edw. III (1363) prohibits under penalties any layman from paying more than five marks a year to a priest residing in his house, and having no cure of souls.</P><P>The next fifty years witness a rapid change in the value of money. Archbishop Sudbury orders that the stipends which Islep had fixed at five and six marks, shall for the same duties, 'on account of the changed times,' be raised to seven and eight marks respectively. But these were doubtless the minimum rates, and in practice more was usually given. There is even distinct evidence that <I>ten marks</I> was a customary rate of salary for a priest to ask. The act of 2 Henry V (1414), after reciting the act of Edw. III previously men|tioned and setting forth that the priests 'which now be' will not serve but for twelve marks, <I>or ten marks by year at the least</I>, to the great damage of the king's liege people, enacts that seven and eight marks shall be the legal salaries, unless by special license of the or|dinary; nine marks not to be ex|ceeded even in that case.</P><P>But the changing times soon ren|dered this statute ineffectual, if it was not ineffectual from the outset. A constitution of Archbishop Chi|chely, dated in 1415, ordains that all through the province of Canter|bury the stipends of needy vicars shall be augmented as a general rule to at least <I>twelve marks</I> a year, if the parish revenues equal that amount.</P><P>The above particulars are found in Gibson's <I>Codex Furis Ecclesiastici Anglicani</I>, pp. 748, 755, 938-9.</P><P>In the province of York the rates appear to have been lower. From the <I>Testamenta Eboracensia</I>, published by the Surtees Society (vol. ii, p. 118) it appears that at York, in the middle of the fifteenth century, the customary payment in respect of a single mass was fourpence Thus in a will dated in 1446 we find&mdash;'Lego ad quinde|cim missas pro anim&acirc; me&acirc; in ecclesia Sti Nicholai apud Novum Castrum super Tinam Vs.' And the ordinary annual payment at the same period, to a priest celebrating masses for the repose of souls, was in York|shire seven marks.</P><P>In preparing this note I have been greatly assisted by Professor Stubbs.</P></NOTE>; religious possessioneris

<P>Here men shulden note &thorn;es wordis, for ech of hem beri&thorn; greet witt; first, how Crist toke leve at his disciplis fro &thorn;e tyme &thorn;at &thorn;ei hadden eeten.

<P>Aftirward we shulden wite, how Christ reprovede unbileve and hardnes of apostlis hertis, &thorn;at weren bifore, and &thorn;anne weren taken awei, for &thorn;ei hadden not sorewe ynow&yogh; for &thorn;ese errours &thorn;at &thorn;ei weren inne.

In the treatise <I>De Spirituali Creatione</I> among the <I>Quaest. Dispu|tatae</I>, Aquinas writes (art. 4) 'Quidam vero dixerunt quod a principio inest anima vegetabilis, et illa eadem cum fuerit magis perfecta fit anima sen|sitiva, et tandem fit anima intellec|tiva.' But the Christian philosopher, holding out for the oneness and in|corruptibility of the human soul, will not admit this; he looks upon the embryonic changes as indicating successive stages of the one soul, but no more. 'Sic cum in embrione primo sit anima vegetativa tantum, cum perventum fuerit ad majorem perfectionem tollitur forma imper|fecta, et succedit forma perfectior, quae est anima vegetativa et sensi|tiva simul, et ultimo cedente, suc|cedit ultima forma completissima, quae est anima rationalis.' To these three elementary stages St. Augus|tine, in the <I>De Quantitate Animae</I>, adds four more, that of moral effort, in which the soul is seeking virtue, that of moral perfection and rest, that of spiritual effort or tendency towards God, and that of the soul's union with and rest in God.</NOTE>; but as we bileven &thorn;e wordis of &thorn;e gospel, &thorn;at Baptist was glad in comyng of Crist, so we supposen &thorn;at he was on lyve a litil bifore &thorn;at Jesus was conseyved, but we musen not how muche, si&thorn; it is Goddis privyte.</P>

By the term Apprentitius (from the French <I>ap|prendre</I>, to learn), as applied to the legal profession, was originally meant, according to Ducange, a law-student merely,&mdash;one who fre|quented the courts and universities in order to gain legal knowledge. But at an early period it became, in England at least, a more honour|able appellation. In Fleta, the author of which wrote under Ed|ward I, the Apprentitius appears as the lowest kind of legal practitioner admitted to the king's courts;&mdash;'in curia autem regi&acirc; sunt servientes, narratores, attornati, et <I>apprenticii</I>' (lib. II. cap. 37). In the reign of Edward II, the term seems to be used much in the same way as 'bar|rister' is now-a-days; thus the jurist, Andrew Horn (on whom see Selden's <I>Dissertatio ad Fletam</I>), dedicates his treatise <I>Speculum Justitiarum (Justi|tiariorum?)</I> to the 'Apprentitii ad barras.' Spelman (Glossarium <I>in voce</I>), says that the Apprentitius, after a course of legal training ex|tending over seven years, was per|mitted 'cancellos salutare,' i.e. to come up to the bar, and there to plead. He thus corresponded to the 'outer barrister' of modern times; and so completely is this the case, that Fortescue (quoted by Spelman), with Selden, Plowden, Sir Henry Finch, and Sir Edward Coke (quoted in Cowell's <I>Interpre|ter</I>), speak of Apprentitius as being only another name for barrister-at|law.</NOTE>, wolen no<NOTE PLACE="foot"><I>not</I>, E.</NOTE> procure in a cause bifore &thorn;at &thorn;ei heeren it, and &thorn;is cause to &thorn;er witt ha&thorn; &thorn;e part of ri&yogh;twisnes; for ellis &thorn;ei maden hemsilf avocatis a&yogh;ens treu&thorn;e wi&thorn; &thorn;e fend.

With regard to the first, it must be remembered that our author wrote but a few years after the death of Edward III, the reviver of the Round Table, and the founder of the order of the Garter, whose reign was the culminating period in England of the spirit of Chivalry. Justing was then, and continued to be for a century and a half after|wards, the favourite amusement of persons of condition. It was usually practised with 'arms of courtesy,' that is, headless lances, and blunted swords without points; but some|times, as when certain knights un|dertook to maintain the honour of their country in a foreign land, wea|pons <I>&agrave; l'outrance</I> were, though under regulations, employed, and most often with deadly effect. Chaucer gives us the whole order and regulation of a tournament in the Knight's Tale. (See Scott's <I>Essay on Chivalry</I> among his Miscellaneous Prose Works.)</P><P>Shooting with the bow was an out-door occupation which was well-nigh universal among the mid|dle and lower classes in the four|teenth and fifteenth centuries. The men exercised in shooting regularly, to keep their hands in as archers. Even ladies, as the illustrations of old MSS. shew, were much given to the use of the bow, both with the sharp-headed arrow in the pur|suit of deer, and with the blunt arrow in bird-bolting.</P><P>Wrestling was a popular amuse|ment with our forefathers as far back as the Saxon times; in the Middle Ages it is mentioned along with bull and bear baiting, putting the stone, throwing the bar, foot|ball, and the like. It does not ap|pear that they were sufficiently brutalized at that time to enjoy boxing.
