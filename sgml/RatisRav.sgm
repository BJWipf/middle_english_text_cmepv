The fyr&stlong; chepture of this trety begynnys of the commendatioune of dede, Fore ded, as haly wryt &slong;ais is mar pretiouxe and worthy, is mai&stlong; terreble, of al thing that may be Thocht. Ande in-&slong;amekle as the &slong;aull Is mare pretious &amp; worthy than The body, in-&slong;amekle is the ded of It mare perulus and doutable to be tholyt.  Ande the ded of synfull man, but &slong;ufficiant Repentans, is euer ill, as the dede of gude men, how &slong;oding or terreble at euer It be, is gude &amp; pretious before gode: For the dede of gude men is nocht ell bot the pa&slong;ing of per&slong;onis Retwrnynge fra bana&slong;ynge, offputyng of a full hevy byrdinge, end of all &slong;eknes, e&slong;chevyng of perellys, the terme of all Ill, the brekinge of al bandys, the payment of naturell det, the agane-cumynge to the kynde lande, ande the entering to perpetuall Joy and welfare; And tharfor the day of ded o neide men is better than the day of thar byrthe; And &slong;a thai that ar all weill &slong;chrewyne, and deis in the faithe and &slong;acrementis of haly

Thai that are in the artykle of ded has v&thorn;er temptations be the deuill, and mar merualus, than euer &thorn;ai had in thare lyfe; Fyr&stlong;, the deuil tempis a man in his deing in the faith of haly kyrk, For but faythe may na man be &slong;aufe.  And It is the grund of al gud deid, &thorn;er-for &thorn;e deuill a&sslong;ais, gif he can gare ony man vare in the treuth, as to put to hyme, that he wald neuer dee For synaris, na be borne of the vergyne mary, &amp; &slong;afurth, of the new testament.  And &thorn;erfore ilk temporall man &slong;uld trow as haly wryt &slong;ais, and namly that his curat tech-is hyme, ande have his hart fermly Set &thorn;erone.  Ande he that is in the artykle houre of dede &slong;uld have a man to raher&szlig; to hyme the poyntis of &thorn;e trouthe, in &slong;yk langage &thorn;at he mycht wnder&stlong;ande, Rycht oft, fore It gret comfort to hyme, and the deuil may nocht heire It : al&slong;ua &thorn;ai &slong;uld raher&szlig; to hyme the gret faith and paciens of marterys ande vthire haly men, how wychtly &thorn;ai &slong;u&stlong;enyt al tormentis and pa&sslong;ionys done to thaim, for the faith of haly kyrke, and ourcome thar ennemys by paciens and ferme faith, as men may Reid in thar &stlong;oreis.  For he that is ferme in the faith optenis tharthrow al that is profytable to the &slong;aull and lyf baith, and It is to wyt quhat temtacioune at euer the deuill putis to man, &slong;al nocht noy hyme, bot gyf he wyl fully con&slong;ent thar-to and at he be in his rycht mynd.

And as haly &slong;cripture &slong;ais, ilke man &slong;al se, in the hour of ded, cry&stlong; as he was crucefyd one the cors, in con&slong;olacioune to gud men, and in confu&slong;ioune and &slong;chame to Ill men, at thai ar nocht worthy to <CORR
