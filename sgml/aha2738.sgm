The patronage, vested in the heirs of John of St. John (no. 3), had now come to his son-in-law, Bernard of St. Valerie (p. 29, n. 5). Accordingly, to permit of Godstow becoming a royal foundation, Bernard of St. Valerie, by a ceremonial act, transferred his rights in the abbey to the Crown.

The above deed, found by Mr. T. Austin among the Exchequer Gate Records at Lincoln, shows that this church served as the parish church for the district around Godstow.

<HEAD>KNIGHTON, in Compton Beauchamp parish.</HEAD>

<HEADNOTE><P>[NOTE.&mdash;Early in the history of the convent, Godstow's interest in this parish was forgotten, and consequently erroneous readings have crept in at most mentions of it in the Registers, both Latin and English. A branch of the St. Valerie family possessed considerable lands here. About 1200 Wido of St. Valerie (possibly a younger brother of Bernard) gave Godstow a rent-charge (nos. 16, 17) of 6s. 8d. over these lands to endow an obital service for his father. About 1225 Wido's 
<PB REF="00000057.tif" N="39"> son, Reginald, sold his Knighton property to St. Frideswyde's priory (Wigram's <I>Cartulary of St. Frideswide</I>, 1896, ii. 297-306). The Rev. H. Salter has shown me that Mr. Wigram, following Dugdale, has assigned the sale to the great Reginald (died 1166), whereas the conveyance is dated 'in die Translacionis B. Thome Martiris,' and cannot therefore be earlier than 1224. In 1286, in an exchange of rent-charges over each other's property, Godstow (no. 509) gave up this Knighton rent-charge to St. Frideswyde's priory. The service for the founder's father was provided for by transferring the obligation to Godstow property in North Oxford, where, at the dissolution in 1540, we find this 6s. 8d. still charged (<I>Monasticon</I>, iv. 370). When, some 150 years later, the compiler of the Latin Register transcribed the deeds about the obit, he could not make out the locality. He had recourse to two subterfuges. Two deeds (nos. 17 and 18), owing to the founder's name, he attached to St. Valerie donations elsewhere. A third (no. 16) he put into his un|identified set at the end, under <I>Cniscetuna</I> (for Cnigtetuna). In the general charters he has even wandered into <I>Cumberton</I>.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>SEACOURT or SECKWORTH.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[NOTE.&mdash;Seuecurda, Seukeworth, Seckworth (Wood's <I>City of Oxford</I>, i. 325-8), and, more recently, Seacourt, was once a considerable village in Berkshire, between Wytham and North Hincksey, of which little now survives except the name (now pronounced 'Sec-urth' by Wytham folks). Its decay probably dates from the con|struction 
<PB REF="00000061.tif" N="43"> of the Seven Bridges Road (formerly, Botley Causeway) which gave a more convenient access from Oxford across the many-streamed Thames valley to the road to Bath and the west. Before that, the route went north from Oxford through Walton for about a mile; then turned westward; crossed the main Thames at Binsey ford; and thence advanced across various branches of Thames by bridges, whose abutments remained till living memory, to Seukeworth, just south of the branch of Thames which parts Oxfordshire from Berkshire.
There is some confusion about the dates of the de Seukeworth family. Wood, basing his judgement on Brian Twyne's excerpts, assumed that William of Seuke|worth gave the tithe of his mills (no. 25) to Godstow at the foundation, in 1138/9. This cannot be, since the first list in which the grant is mentioned is Henry II's second charter (no. 879), i.e. about 1165. The family descent seems to be&mdash;Robert of Seukeworth, about 1140; William, about 1165; Robert, 1200; Sir William, 1230; Dionysia, 1260.
The church (no. 27), or chapel-of-ease, of Seukeworth was a benefaction of the family to Studley Priory in Oxfordshire.
At the dissolution, 1540, Godstow still owned (<I>Monast</I>. iv. 375) a parcel of meadow called Secourt ham, valued at 3s. 4d. a year, and then reckoned to be in Wytham parish.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="end">[NOTE.&mdash;I take this conduit to be for the supply of drinking water to the nunnery. Somewhere beyond the village of Wytham, a reservoir seems to have been con|structed to catch one of the springs which gush out of the foot of the Berkshire 
<PB REF="00000064.tif" N="46"> hills. Mr. H. Hurst points out the difficulty of supposing engineers at that date to be capable of conducting a stream of water under the branches of Thames which lie between Wytham and Godstow. But Oseney Abbey (Wood's <I>City of Oxford</I>, ii. 205) was supplied by a reservoir at North Hincksey, and portions of the lead-pipe (enclosed in stone), by which the water was conveyed across the Thames valley and probably under the streams, have been dug up in modern times. Otho Nicholson's conduit (Wood, i. 441) at Carfax, built in 1610, of which the reservoir|house still stands on the slope of Hincksey hill, is a later and more famous example. Mr. Hurst has drawn my attention to a remarkable work to supply the tanks within the nunnery enclosure and the large fishponds outside. To the west of Godstow there is a small, winding branch of Thames, called 'Wytham brook.' From this, by a straight artificial canal, a stream of water was led along most of the west side of the gardens, parallel to the convent. When near the south-west corner, this canal turned sharply eastwards, was brought under the west wall by a fourteenth|century arch (which still remains), formed within the court two largish baths or ponds, passed through the east wall by an arch, no doubt fed the fishponds (which had one arm 65 yards by 9 yards, another 23 yards by 8 yards, both of about 4 feet deep: all filled up in 1887) which lay just south of the convent; and thence escaped to the Thames by a channel which was filled up in 1885. This was called the 'Sanctuary Stream.' The field enclosed between this stream on the west and the convent buildings on the east is called 'Sanctuary Field'; that west of it is called 'Sentry Field,' probably from memory of the 1645-6 campaigns. At the point where Sanctuary stream leaves Wytham brook, an elm-tree was blown down in 1899. The cattle, trampling over the spot, brought out the foundations of a rectangular building which had no doubt been erected to keep the water in the canal at a just level. Mr. Hurst, who made the discovery, thinks that this is the 'head' described in no. 28. I do not agree, for I cannot find here any 'arable land,' for the crossing of which (nos. 28, 29) permission had to be obtained. I must, how|ever, add that Mr. Hurst opines that the levels of the water round Godstow have been greatly altered, and that lands now meadow may have been formerly plowable.]</NOTE>

<HEAD>LANGFORD.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[NOTE.&mdash;The parish of Langford is of exceptional interest. It is now reckoned as being in the county of Oxford, but part of it was formerly reckoned as being in Berkshire. It represents, therefore, the debateable land where the two kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia pushed each other backwards and forwards, and the land sometimes was in the Wessex see of Salisbury, at other times in the Mercian see of Lincoln. In <I>Monast</I>. vi. 1276 is printed a charter of Henry II conferring on Lincoln Minster 'the church of Langeford and all the land which Roger, bishop of Sarum (died 1139, Dec. 4), held in that vill,' on the petition of Robert (de Chesney), bishop of Lincoln (1147-68). Two prebends, 'Langford ecclesia' and 'Langford manor,' were endowed from this source. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are now the lay impropriators of the parish. The three earliest of the following deeds belong to the time of that endowment. Unfortunately the record is incomplete, by the excision of the second leaf of this section, a loss which is not made good by the still more mutilated Exchequer MS. It appears that bishop Robert, before conveying the estate to Lincoln Minster, took out a messuage and half a hide of land which he granted, at 12d. yearly quit|rent, to one of his serfs, Jeffrey son of Fowke, and which he had formerly granted to Jeffrey's brother, Robert (probably since deceased). At a later period we find these lands placed under feoffees, as though to found a chantry, but the documents are not brought to a definite conclusion. I have inquired at Langford and found no tradition of Godstow having owned lands there, but a conjecture is hazarded that the chantry may have been connected with a chapel at the celebrated Radcott bridge<NOTE PLACE="foot">Battle of Radcott bridge, Dec. 20, 1387.</NOTE> in Langford.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEADNOTE><P>[NOTE.&mdash;Although the deeds relating to Godstow property in Oxford are numerous, the estate of the convent there was comparatively unimportant, except in the extra|mural district of Walton and St. Giles. In Oxford proper the holdings were mostly pre-occupied by the older and greater foundations of St. Frideswyde's and Oseney; and Godstow had also to meet the competition of other religious houses near Oxford, as the Hospitals of St. Bartholomew and of St. John the Baptist, Abingdon Abbey, Einsham Abbey, Rewley Abbey, Studley Priory. The compiler of the Latin Register arranged these deeds roughly by parishes. They have now been brought more strictly into order, and the extra-parochial deeds put by themselves in three sets:&mdash; 1.

At the dissolution, in 1540, we find (<I>Monast</I>. iv. 370) Godstow lands charged with &pound;1 5s. yearly to provide a pittance on the anniversary of Ela (de Longesp&eacute;e), countess of Warwick, and also with &pound;7 7s. to be spent in almsgiving and in the salaries of two chaplains to say mass in Godstow chapel for the same countess. There is nowhere any mention of endowment supplied by her to meet these charges. Since she died in 1297, it is possible that about 1290 she advanced money to provide such endowment, and that 'Middleton Hall' in St. Giles was purchased out of that fund.]</NOTE>

The agreement was reached 'in sinodo Oxon,' i. e. the annual meeting of the clergy of the arch|deaconry of Oxford. Rev. H.

The date is also fixed by the absence of the property from pope Eugenius III's confirmation, 1145, and from Henry II's first confirmation, 1156, and its presence in Henry II's second confirmation (no. 879), 1165. Against the identification with Combe Longa is the fact that the manor of Combe Longa was in the King's hands from 1154 on|wards; so that its miller, in making his grant, would have appealed to the King, his overlord, not to the bishop. The extant accounts of the manor (in Public Records Office) are not early enough to help us. Rev. S. Spencer Pearce, Vicar of Combe, tells me that there is no mention of the mill in the accounts 1243-99, but in those of 1304-11 it is plainly in the King's own hands.]</P></HEADNOTE>
