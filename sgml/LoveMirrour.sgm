<P> <TITLE>The Mirrour of the Blessed Life of Christ</TITLE> was keyboarded by Sencor, 5% proofed and found to be within 1 error in 20,000 characters specifications.  Subsequent to keyboarding the text, it was encoded by Catherine Paul, and the markup was reviewed by Kenneth Church.</P><P>With the exception of chapter numbers, none of the manuscript's marginalia has been retained.  Chapter numbers are marked, according to the Latin marginalia, using the abbreviations "Cam." and "Capm." for chapter, with the number written in Roman numerals, and this system has been retained verbatim in the chapter headings in the electronic edition.  Where the chapter number is supplied in the main text, as is the case for Chapter Eleven, the marginal chapter number has not been included. In one instance -- Capm.3m  -- the chapter is divided into three parts, and these are tagged as such with Div2 tags.  In addition, rather than retaining the two chapter 33s as occur in the printed edition, we have kept only the first chapter heading for chapter 33 and tagged the other as a part of chapter 33.</P><P><TITLE>The Mirrour</TITLE> is divided into seven parts corresponding to the days of the week, and each part is in turn divided into chapters.  As there is a header marking the beginning of most of the seven parts, headers have been supplied where they are lacking (e.g., part one, or "Monday").  These supplied headers are noted as such by the presence of square brackets surrounding them, and by explicit notation in their attributes. </P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER>

<P>THIS devotional Life of Our Lord is a free translation
of portions of the Latin Meditationes Vitae
Christi, a work variously attributed to S. Bonaventura,
the Augustinian Cardinal Bonaventura Baduarius, and
to Joannes Gorus, most frequently to the first-named.
The Meditationes were popular over the whole of Europe,
and were rendered into the vernacular of most Continental
countries.  The English version was made by
Nicholas Love, prior of the Carthusian house of Mount
Grace de Ingelby, Yorks., before 1410; in that year it
was presented to Archbishop Arundel, noted for his
vigorous persecution of the Lollards.  Nothing is
definitely known about Nicholas Love beyond the
statement found in many manuscripts that the translation
was made by him.<note ID="note.1" >In 1415 Henry V confirmed to Nicholas, prior of Mount Grace, the alien priory of Hinckley.  This prior is most probably our translator.</NOTE></P>
<P>The ascription of the translation to T. Merton, or
Morton, rests upon the note 'Explicit liber speculum vite
Christi per T. Morton', found in MS. Bodley 131, a copy
dating about 1460.</P>
<P N="1">The number of manuscripts is very great, twenty-three
are known to exist; but the textual variation
between them is of so little importance that the plan
adopted of reproducing one manuscript in collation
with two others is justifiable.  The manuscript I have
chosen for the text is MS. Brasenose College e. 9 (now
deposited in the Bodleian Library).  This copy is quite
perfect, containing portions intentionally omitted in
other manuscripts; it is carefully written in a neat
scribal hand, and has very few textual errors; it was
made about 1430.  An additional interesting feature



<pb N="iv"  ID="pb.3" >
in connexion with it is the fact of its having the
translator's monogram at the foot of the first page.</P>
<P>The two manuscripts which I have collated with
the Brasenose MS. are the Sherard MS. (in the possession
of Lord Aldenham) and another Bodleian copy,
MS. e. Mus&aelig;o 35.  Both are well-written and finely
illuminated examples, and date from the latter half of
the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>The 'Mirrour' was printed by Caxton?1488, Pynson
?1495, and by Wynkyn de Worde in 1517 and 1523.</P>
<P>As regards the treatment of the text it is only
necessary to say that the &thorn; of the manuscript has been
expanded to th; on the other hand, &yogh; has been retained,
because of its difference in value; i&hbar;u has been written
Jesu throughout.  The punctuation is editorial, the
pointing of the manuscript being of no value.</P>
<P>It is not expected that the language will present
any difficulty, but as an aid to those who are unfamiliar
with the earlier forms of our language a word-list has
been added.</P>
<P>It is a source of deep regret to the editor that the
late Lord Aldenham did not live to see the completion
of a work in which he took great interest, willingly
rendering every assistance in his power towards its
publication.  My thanks are also due to the Librarian
of Brasenose College (Mr. G. H. Wakeling, M.A.), for
permission to transcribe the college manuscript; and
to Sir Henry Ingilby, for the loan of his copy.</P>
<P>To Dr. W. A. Craigie, who has read the proofs,
I am greatly indebted for many valuable hints and
suggestions; also I have to thank Miss E. R. Steane
for her assistance in the production of the volume.</P>

&slong;eide his moder: Sone / wolt thow not gone home a&yogh;en with

<P>&para; In this for&slong;eide proces of Je&slong;u what hope we that he
didde? or where and in what manere lyued he tho thre

of pore men&middot; and there he &slong;chamefa&slong;tly prayed and a&slong;ked

<P>&para; Furthermore in the for&slong;eide proces we mowe note
and lerne thre profitable thinges to vs.  Fir&slong;te is that he
that wole perfitely &slong;erue god &slong;chal not dwelle amonge his
fle&slong;chely frendes and kynne&slong;men / bot he mo&slong;te leue hem
and goo fro hem.  In token where of the child Je&slong;u lafte
his owne dere moder what tyme he wolde &yogh;eue tente to
the goo&slong;tly werkes of his fader&middot; and al&slong;o whan he was
&slong;owht among his frendes and kenne&slong;men he was not
<pb N="78"  ID="pb.81" >
founden there in that tyme.  The &slong;ecounde is that he
that ledeth goo&slong;tly lyf wonder not moche / ne be not di&slong;comforted
ouere heuely / thou&yogh; he be &slong;om tyme &slong;o drie in
&slong;oule / and as voyde of deuocioun as he were for&slong;ake of
god.  For this manere byfelle to goddes moder / as it is
&slong;eide bifore.  Wherefore be he not in de&slong;peire therby /
bot be&slong;ilich &slong;eche he Je&slong;u in holy meditaciouns and gode
werkes / and &slong;pecially in deuoute prayeres / and he &slong;chal
fynde hym at the la&slong;te in dewe tyme.  The thridde is that
a man folowe not to moche his owne will or his owne
witt.  For oure lorde Je&slong;u after he &slong;eide that hym byhoued
to be occupied in tho thinges that longed to his fader

is a&slong;pecially nedefulle to religious folke to folowe by trewe
obedience to her &slong;ouereynes: and al&slong;o here we haue grete

But as he &slong;pake and wrou&yogh;t vertuou&slong;ly in tyme / &slong;o he helde

Wherfore he that was &slong;ouereyne mai&slong;tre / and came to

his &slong;uppo&slong;ed fader Jo&slong;eph in his craft&middot; comynge and

in age and in wi&slong;dom and in grace to fore god and man&middot;
that is to &slong;eie / as in the &slong;i&yogh;t and the opinioun of men.
But nowe whan he was of more age in to the tyme of his
thrittythe &yogh;ere he &slong;chewed none dedes of commendacioun
outeward&middot; wherefore men &slong;korned hym / and helde hym
as an ydiote and an ydel man and a fole: and &slong;o it was

vertuou&slong;e dede of worthy commendynge&middot; and what was
that?  Sothely that he made hym &slong;elf foule and abiecte

hadde this nede: for &slong;othely as I trowe in alle oure dedes

Wherfore as me thynketh that man is comen to the hi&yogh;e&slong;t

that he willeth not to be in reputacioun of men&middot; but
coueiteth fully to be de&slong;pi&slong;ed and holde as foule / vnworthy

to commende than a man to be pa&slong;&slong;yngly &slong;trong and
a conquerour of citees and londes / as Salamon witne&slong;&slong;ith.
Wherfore til we come to this degre of perfeccioun we
&slong;chulle holde oure &slong;elf as ful inperfite / and al that we

he is as no&yogh;t / he bygileth and deceyueth hym &slong;elf.
And &slong;o as we &slong;eide bifore / oure lorde Je&slong;u lyued in this

world not for his owne nede / but forto teche vs the trewe

mowe not be excu&slong;ed&middot; for it is an abhominable thing

<P>&para; Here &slong;eith the glo&slong;e that mekenes hath thre degrees.
The fir&slong;te degree is: a man to be &slong;ugett and lowed to his

degree of mekenes is: to be &slong;ugett and lowed to his vnderlynge
/ that is he that is la&slong;&slong;e in e&slong;tate than he.  And this
degre kept oure lord Je&slong;u at this tyme whan he meked

alle the perfeccioun of mekenes.</P>
<P>&para; And than whan John &slong;awh oure lordes wille that

<pb N="89"  ID="pb.92" >
that thing that he tau&yogh;te after by worde / nowe he &slong;pake

But now may he no lenger be hidde / &slong;ithen he is &slong;o

of &slong;eint Bernard in &slong;entence / confermynge that was &slong;eide
bifore in the next chapitre&middot; hou that oure lord Je&slong;u
mekely hilde his pees in to this tyme / for oure doctrine
to fle pre&slong;umpcioun and kepe perfi&yogh;te mekenes.  The
which vertue &yogh;it here in his bapteme he &slong;chewed more

Je&slong;u cam among hem / and in her &slong;i&yogh;t was bapti&slong;ed as

<P>What tyme that oure lord Je&slong;u was bapti&slong;ed /

and fourty ny&yogh;tes / no&yogh;t etynge or drynkynge&middot; and / as
the euangeli&slong;te Marke telleth / his dwellynge was there
with bee&slong;tes.  Now &yogh;eue we here good entente to oure
lord Je&slong;u &slong;pecially and to his dedes&middot; for here he techeth
vs and &yogh;eueth vs en&slong;aumple of many grete vertues: as in

mekely is conuer&slong;aunt with be&slong;tes.  In the whiche proces
ben touched foure thinges that longen &slong;pecially to goo&slong;tly
exerci&slong;e and vertuous lyuynge / and that wonderfully
helpen eche othere to gidre: that is to &slong;aie / &slong;olitarie
beynge / fa&slong;tynge / prayere / and penaunce of the body.
By the whiche we mowe come be&slong;te to that noble vertue /
that is clennes of herte&middot; the whiche clennes we oweth

book that is cleped <FOREIGN>Collaciones patrum</FOREIGN> it is &slong;eide that all
the exerci&slong;e of a monke &slong;chulde be principally to gete
and haue clenne&slong;&slong;e of herte: and no wonder / for there

Wherfore that we mowe be &slong;o knytte to hym by grace /
be we aboute with all oure wille and my&yogh;te to folwe hym /
that is to &slong;ay in trewe &slong;olitarie beynge / as it is &slong;eide / and in

<pb N="94"  ID="pb.97" >
xl dayes after / in the whiche he fa&slong;ted and lyued there /
as it is &slong;eide.</P>
<P>&para; But now furthermore as to his temptacioun.  Whan
tho xl dayes of his fa&slong;tynge were complete / oure lorde
Je&slong;u hungred&middot; and anon that fal&slong;e temptour / the fende /
that was be&slong;y aboute to knowe whether he were goddes
&slong;one / cam to hym / and gan to tempte hym of glotonye
and &slong;eide: &YOGH;if thou be goddes &slong;one / &slong;eie that the&slong;e &slong;tones
be made and torned in to looues.  But he my&yogh;te not with
his trecherie deceyue hym that was may&slong;ter of truthe&middot;
for he an&slong;wered hym &slong;o wi&slong;ely / that neither he was
ouercome by the temptacioun of glotony and &yogh;it the
aduer&slong;arie my&yogh;te not knowe that he de&slong;ired&middot; for neither
he denyed / ne affermed that he was goddes &slong;one / but
concluded hym by auctorite of holy writt.  And &slong;o haue
we here en&slong;aumple of oure lorde Je&slong;u to with&slong;tonde the
vice of glotonye: for there mo&slong;te we bygynne &yogh;if we wil
ouercome othere vices / as the enemy comounly bygynneth
therwith to a&slong;&slong;aile hem that taken hem to goo&slong;tly lyuynge.
Wherfore as it &slong;emeth he that is ouercome with that vice
of glotonye / that while he is feble and vnmy&yogh;ti to ouercome

of the go&slong;pell / that bot glotonye be fir&slong;t refreyned / man
trauailleth in veyn a&yogh;en&slong;t othere vices.</P>
<P>&para; Afterward the deuel toke hym vppe and bare hym
in to Jeru&slong;alem / that was fro that place aboute viij myle
as men &slong;eien / and there he &slong;ette hym vppon the pynacle
of the temple where he tempted hym of veyne ioye /

he hirte hym not as a man by pride / and hym &slong;elfe was

<pb N="95"  ID="pb.98" >
en&slong;aumple of pacience / con&slong;iderynge the grete benignyte
and pacience of oure lord Je&slong;u / that &slong;uffred hym &slong;elf to
be handeled and borne of that cruel bee&slong;t that hated hym
and al that he loued.</P>
<P>&para; And after that tyme / as &slong;eint Bernard &slong;eith / the
enemy &slong;eeng that he &slong;chewed no thing of the godhede /
and &slong;uppo&slong;ynge therby that he was not god / tempted
hym after as a man.  At this thridde tyme whan he toke
hym vp efte and bare hym a&yogh;en in to a ful hi&yogh;e hille / by
&slong;ide the for&slong;eide hille of Quarentena / as the &slong;pace of two
myle / and there he tempted hym of auarice and therwith
of ydolatrie.  But therfore was he there opounly reproued
and fully venquy&slong;ched and ouercome / as dyuer&slong;e doctoures
tellen that expownen more pleynely thi&slong;e temptaciouns and
this go&slong;pelle&middot; and therefore we pa&slong;&slong;en ouer the &slong;hortlyere
here / as we done in othere expo&slong;iciouns / &slong;tandinge principally
in meditaciouns / as it was &slong;eide at the bigynnynge
of this book.</P>
<P>&para; &YOGH;if we take then here good hede hou oure lord Je&slong;u
was handeled and tempted of the enemy / we &slong;chulle not

not only he was tempted in thi&slong;e thre tymes / but al&slong;o / as

&slong;eith that he was tempted in all manere temptacioun that
longeth to the infirmyte of man / with oute &slong;ynne.</P>
<P>&para; Furthermore whan the enemy was fully ouercome /
and gone awey / aungels come and &slong;erued and myni&slong;tred
hym.  But here take we now good hede and byholde

the comoun kynde of the manhede&middot; for &yogh;if we take hede

que&slong;tioun / for it is no dowte that he my&yogh;te make what
that hym le&slong;te / and al&slong;o haue of thoo that bene or weren

he v&slong;ed this my&yogh;t and this powere for hym &slong;elf / or for his
di&slong;ciples in her bodily nede / but for the peple to &slong;chewe
his godhede.  We reden that at tweie tymes he fedde
hem myraculou&slong;liche / in grete multitude / of a fewe loues
and fi&slong;ches.  But of his di&slong;ciples is writen that in his

he hym &slong;elf was wery of the wey / and &slong;atte vppon the
welle / &slong;pekynge with a womman Samaritane / we reden
not that he made mete forto ete / but that he &slong;ente his
di&slong;ciples in to the citee to bygge her mete&middot; and &slong;o it is not
lickely at this tyme after his fa&slong;te and bodily honger he
purueiede his mete by myracle / &slong;ithen in this tyme he
&slong;chewed only his manhede.  And al&slong;o there was no peple
there forto worche myracle to her edificacioun as comounly
he didde / bot only aungels weren there pre&slong;ent.  And &slong;ithen
in that hille was none dwellynge of men / ne mete redy

mannis mete al redy di&yogh;t fro another place / as it byfel
to the prophete Daniel.  For as holy writt telleth what
tyme daniel was putte in to pitte of lyouns / and abakuc /

<P>&para; Furthermore we haue here techynge of pacience

<P>&para; And here mowe we &slong;een open preef of the pa&slong;&slong;ynge
