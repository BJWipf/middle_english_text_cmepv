Hou perilose to the same lay persoonys this unobedience is, it is ful cleerli schewid in this present book, the vii<SUP>e</SUP>, viii<SUP>e</SUP>, and ix<SUP>e</SUP> chapiters.

<P>And ferthermore, if in this bifore spokun attendaunce, herkenyng, and heering, in con|versacioun taking with peple of dyverse stidis, lenger leiser be lad forth, and mo daies in tyme be spende, it schal be aspied and seen that forto bringe alle the lay peple, as thei ben now wittid and disposid, into obeischaunce forto bileeue as the clergie bileeveth, this is no meene to be pre|supposid that the clergie or the chirche of the clergie may not erre in mater of feith, in so myche that summe clerkis attempten and assaien forto calle a&yogh;en suche seid unobeiers into the seid dew obedience to the clergie and by this seide meene. And whilis tho clerkis laboren and ben aboute for to iustifie thilke meene, that the clergie, namelich gaderid togidere in a general counseil, may not erre and faile a&yogh;ens eny article of feith, neither may determyne amys a&yogh;ens trewe feith, tho clerkis tho whilis laboren in veyn, as into the effect of the seid lay menys turnyng; &yogh;he, and peraventure thei in that doon harme and no good, and thei<MILESTONE N="2b" UNIT="folio"> schenden what thei ben aboute forto amende. Forwhi, thei ben lau&yogh;ed into scoorn of the lay personys whiche schulden bi labour of tho clerkis be convertid; and that, bothe for this conclusioun is so unlikeli to be trewe as the witte and conceite of ri&yogh;t greet wittid lay men being of greet repu|tacioun, and also for that thei han colour of 
<PB REF="00000112.tif" N="112"> doctouris writing, sownyng into her therynne partie.</P>
<P>And over this, it semeth to the lay persoonys that tho clerkis ben over favorable in mater longing to her favour and worschip, and ben not iugis indiffe|rent, and stonding for the parti which hath the treuthe, whiche ever thilk party be. And for this semyng, the seid lay men han the lasse wille forto truste to the iugement of clerkis in alle othere maters. Certis, ech iust and indifferent iuge ou&yogh;te seie and holde a&yogh;ens himsilf in trouthe, as wel as a&yogh;ens othere persoonys in trouthe, and as with him silf or othere persoonys in trouthe. And bicause that it semeth to the lay persoonys that clerkis, namelich holding as now is seid, holden not so<MILESTONE N="3a" UNIT="folio"> indifferentli in the mater longing to her honour and favour, therfore forto allegge the seid meene into eeris of the seid lay men, is not expedient into her conversioun. In so myche that tho clerkis mowe not oonly seie what is writun thus: <I>In al the ny&yogh;t we laboring han take no thing</I>; but also ech of hem may seie what Poul rehersith, Rom. x<SUP>e</SUP> ch. in the eende thus: <I>Al day y strei&yogh;te out myn hond to a peple that bileeved not, but a&yogh;en seiden me</I>. Wherto therfore schulde the clergie leene oonly to thilke meene anentis lay men, whiche lay men wole not admitte. Bettir it were to seche aftir<NOTE PLACE="foot">Marginal correction <I>for</I>.</NOTE> another

And so forto move and convicte hem into obedience, never the lasse and never the latter, to the clergie in leernyng her feith; thou&yogh; it were so that the clergie may erre and faile a&yogh;ens feith, and thou&yogh; the clergie my&yogh;te solempnely determyne a&yogh;ens trewe feith; so that, by the grace of God, withynne processe of &yogh;eeris it schal be verified forto seie to the clergie what Ysaie propheciede, lx. c. thus: <I>Thi sones schulen come to thee fro longe and thi dou&yogh;tris schulen rise a&yogh;en to thee fro brood</I>: that as Ysaie meened that the children of the Cristen chirche schulden come and rise a&yogh;en fro lengthe and breed of cuntrees, so y hope bi processe of tyme, aftir that this and other bokis schulen be publischid, and be abrood multiplied to

<P>Over these causis here now bifore expressid, into the iustifiyng that my now last seid entent, to be perfoormyd in this present book, is to be allowid and acceptid, y may sette therto more thus. If twey thingis ben the principal causis of heresie in the lay peple whiche ben clepid lollardis, &yogh;he and if thei ben causis, as it were, of alle her erringis generaly, sotheli, forto remove and take awey fro hem tho twey causis muste nedis be the grettist remedie doyng a&yogh;ens her erringis, which may be do therto. But so it is that these ii thingis, of whiche the first is this, over myche leenyng to Scripture,<MILESTONE N="4b" UNIT="folio"> and in such maner wise as it longith not to Holi Scripture forto receyve; and the ii<SUP>e</SUP> is this, setting not bi forto folowe the determynaciouns and the holdingis of the chirche in mater of feith; and that for as myche as thei presupposen as what may be sufficiently provid<NOTE PLACE="foot">A corrupt passage, difficult to set right.

Wherfore folowingli herof, sithen it is so that it is wel acceptid and allowid of hi&yogh;e prelatis, and of lou&yogh;er clerkis, what y have write and laborid in the first party of the <I>Represser</I>, and in the book callid <I>Iust apprising of Holy Scripture</I>, forto remove and take awey the first now seid<MILESTONE N="5a" UNIT="folio"> thing from the multitude of lay peple now erring in heresie; so bi lijk skile this ou&yogh;te be wel acceptid and allowid, what y write in this present book, forto remove and take awey the ii<SUP>e</SUP> now seid thing from the multitude of lay peple now erring. Which twey thingis y dare wel seie wole not be take awey from hem, but bi such labour as y make in the first party of the <I>Represser</I>, and in the book callid <I>lust apprising of Holy Scrip|ture</I>, into the distroiyng of the first seid thing; and bi the labour of myn here take intent, to be per|foormed in suche maner as it schal bi performyd in this present book, into distroiyng of the ii<SUP>e</SUP> seid thing. And ferthermore, into tyme these twey 
<PB REF="00000116.tif" N="116"> seid thingis be take so cleerly awey from hem that thei kunnen not seie therto nay, thei schulen never be convertid. But forsothe, that these writyngis now spokun, and othere mo maad in the lay peplis langage, take her effectis, into reformyng of the lay peple now erryng, it is not ynou&yogh; that the seid bokis be writen and made and leid up or rest in the<MILESTONE N="5b" UNIT="folio"> hondis of clerkis, thou&yogh; fame and noise be made greet to the seid lay peple of suche bokis, and that tho bokis schulde opene to hem that thei erren; but tho bokis musten be distributid and delid abrood to manye, where that nede is trowid that thei be delid: and that the seid erring persoonys take longe leiser, forto sadli and oft overrede tho bokis, unto tyme thei schulen be wel aqueyntid with tho bokis, and with the skilis and motivis therynne writen, and not forto have in oon tyme, or ii tymes, a li&yogh;t superficial overreding or heering oonly. Forwhi, the stronge confeermyd oold custom which thei han, rootid bi longe tyme into the contrarie, wole make that these bokis at first schulen be unsavery, thou&yogh; aftirward thei schulen be ful delectable, as experience hath be had of this trouthe in dyverse persoonys of thilk multitude. And sithen thilk longe uce and custom wole lette hem, as wel forto seche aftir the now seid<MILESTONE N="6a" UNIT="folio"> bokis, and forto do cost into the writyng and making and multipliyng of tho bokis, eer thei

And this y seie herfore, that y drede hasti iugementis. Happily summe men whiche han not laborid so moche as wolde be a thrifty labour thoru&yogh; oon day, for conversion of the seid erring lay peple, wolen sette her wittis anoon bifore the wittis of hem, which han dyvysid and laborid ther<MILESTONE N="7a" UNIT="folio"> aboute by manye &yogh;eris.

Wherfore it semeth that forto seche aftir the gretter evydence, to prove and confeerme a bileeve, where that lasse grete evydence wole suffice, is not preiseable, but blameworth. And if this be so, thanne forto so seche aftir tho greter evydencis lassith the merit of the same bileve. Also, Luk.

<P>Sone, take good hede to the same processis which thou hast now forth spokun; and marke you weel therwith this what y schal seie, and thanne thin obiecciouns schulen be assoilid. First, considere thou that these iii casis ben dyvers, and not oon; that is to seie, a man forto not holde him content with evydencis sufficient to gendre in him a feith, but forto seche aftir othere and grettir evydencis, and ellis forto not bileeve in the seid feith; and a man forto be content with evydencis sufficient to gendre a feith, forto bileeve in the same feith, and &yogh;itt to seche aftir grettir and mo evydencis, into confirmacioun of the same feith; and a man forto holde him content and paied with sufficient evydencis unto a feith, and to not seche eny ferther for evydencis, gretter or mo, into the con|firmacioun of the same feith. Certis, sone, the first<MILESTONE N="30b" UNIT="folio"> case is openli reprovable, the ii<SUP>e</SUP> and the iii<SUP>e</SUP> ben allowable and preiseable. In the first case weren the Iewis anentis Crist, whiche wolden not bileeve into Crist for sufficient evydencis, which Crist &yogh;ave to hem forto so bileeve, but thei sou&yogh;ten aftir grettir, and mo evydencis, eer thei wolden bileeve as it is open, Mt. xii<SUP>e</SUP> chap<SUP>r</SUP>. and xvi<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>.; Mr. viii<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>.; Luk. xi<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>.; Johnne vi<SUP>e</SUP> chap. And in lijk case was Thomas, in the day of Cristis resurrexioun. Forwhi, not withstonding that he hadde sufficient evydencis forto bileeve Cristis resurrexioun, &yogh;itt 
<PB REF="00000155.tif" N="155"> he wolde not bileeve bi hem, but he sou&yogh;te aftir gretter evydencis, and seide as is bifore rehercid in this present chapiter thus; <I>But if y schal se in the hondis of him the stiking of the nailis</I>, et cetera. And therfore Crist blamyd him, not as for that he sou&yogh;t aftir grettir evydencis oonli, but for that he helde him not content with other sufficient evydencis, to bileeve Christis resurrexioun, but he<MILESTONE N="31a" UNIT="folio"> sou&yogh;t aftir gretter evydencis, eer than he wolde bileeve; and therfore he was worthi be blamed, as he was blamed, whanne Crist said thus; <I>For that thou hast seen me, O Thomas, thou hast bileeved</I>, as thou&yogh; Crist hadde seide thus: <I>Not withstonding thou haddist bifore sufficient evydencis to bileeve, thou woldist not bileeve, but for that thou hast seen me thou hast bileeved</I>. That Thomas had sufficient evydencis bifore forto bileeve Cristis resurrexioun, eer Crist schewid to him hise hondis and hise feet, y may prove thus. We now lyvyng han sufficient evydence forto bileeve Cristis resurreccioun bi this, that the apostlis han denouncid to us that Crist roos fro deeth; and we mowe have sufficient evydencis that the apostlis weren trewe and trusty men, and not liers. But Thomas hadde thanne these same evydencis in as good maner, or in better, than we han now for us. Forwhi he herde the apostlis denounce Cristis resurrexioun to him, bi her owne mouthe, there that thei denouncen the 
<PB REF="00000156.tif" N="156"> same to us bi her writing; and also he knewe bi experience the treuthe, and the sadnes, and the unbigilefulnes of hise felowis, where that we knowen it bi likelihode oonli, thou&yogh; so likeli that to the contrarie we have noon evydence so likeli. Wherfore, if we ben bounden now forto bileeve Cristis resurrexioun, as for therupon sufficient evydence to us had, even so moche, or more, Thomas was bounde, eer Crist apperid to him, forto bileeve Cristis resurrexioun, for sufficient evydence therupon to him mynystrid bi his trewe britheren, whom he ful likeli knewe to be no liers. And so folowith that Thomas was in the first case, and worthi to be blamed, as he was blamed of Crist. In the first case also was Zacharie, Luk. i<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>., and therfore he was punyschid. Certis, if thei hadden be in the secunde case, or in the iii<SUP>e</SUP>, thei hadden not be blamed. The x apostlis weren<MILESTONE N="32a" UNIT="folio"> in the iii<SUP>e</SUP> case, and therfore thei weren not blamed, but thei weren commendid of Crist, whanne he seid thus: <I>Blessid be thei, that is to seie, thi felowis, the othere x apostlis whiche han not seen, that is to seie in thilk maner as thou hast</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. haast.</NOTE> <I>seen, or namelich in thilk maner as thou desiridist to se, and &yogh;itt thei han bileeved, holding hem content, for that without thilke now seid si&yogh;t thei hadden sufficient evydence forto bileeve my resurreccioun</I>. Ferthermore, sone, as

Forwhi, the chirche in hevene is not oon aungel, but it is manye thousind of thousind aungels, and Poul in the seid wordis spekith not of manye aungels togider, but singulerli of oon aungel. Wherfore it folowith that Poul makith no menciun here of the hole chirche being in heven; and if Poul makith here no mensioun of the chirche in hevene, it folowith that he preferrith no thing here to the chirche in hevene. Also, in the seid first chapiter to Galathies, Poul spekith of his owne persoone, and of the gospel which he in his owne singuler persoone receyved, bi revelacioun of Iesus Crist, and not bi man, and therfore not receyved bi the chirche in erthe, as is open in the same chapiter.

<P>NEVERTHELES, y dare wel this seie, and avowe, and this reverence y &yogh;eve to the chirche in erthe, that whanne ever the chirche of God in erthe holdith eny article as feith, or hath determyned thilk article to be feith, every singuler persoone of the same chirche, hou wise ever he be, and hou digne and worthi ever he be, is bounden, undir peyne of dampnacioun, for to bileeve thilk same article as feith, and so therynne forto obeie to the chirche; &yogh;he, thou&yogh; the chirche therynne bileeved or determyned falseli or amys, but if he can, evy|dentli and openli without eny doute, schewe, teche, and declare that the chirche bileeveth, or hath determyned thilk article wrongli and untreuli, or ellis that the chirche hath no sufficient ground for to so bileeve or determyne. &yogh;he, and thou&yogh; the chirche schulde bileve or determyne amys, &yogh;itt therof schulde not this persoone be blamed of God, but schulde be ful excusid, &yogh;he, he schulde be rewardid and medid in hevene. That this is<MILESTONE N="47b" UNIT="folio"> trewe, y prove thus. If the apostlis were now

Wherfore folowith that, as the lay peple now lyvyng weren bounde forto in mater of feith obeie to the apostlis, if the apostlis now lyveden, so the lay peple, now<MILESTONE N="48a" UNIT="folio"> lyvyng, ben bounde forto obeie in mater of feith to the bischopis and preestis, now to the apostlis, and aftir the apostlis succeding, and the placis of the apostlis occupiyng, in lasse than the people now lyvyng kouthen obiect a&yogh;ens the bischopis and preestis now lyvyng, sureli and without eny dout, that thei erren in bileeve, and techen and bidden amys about bileeve.

<P>This same now bifore maad argument may be maad in cleerer foorme thus.

Forwhi, ellis in waast and in veyn tho successouris schulden be ordeynyd, forto succede to the seid predecessouris<NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. predessouris.</NOTE> upon the seid peple. But so it is, that the apostlis weren predecessoris to the bischopis, and preestis now lyvyng, upon the lay peple in cause and mater of feith teching, and of comaunding feith to be leernyd, kunne, and kept, as no man wole denye, for Crist it seide, Acts i<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>., that the apostlis schulden be witnessers to him in al the lond of Iewri, and in al the lond of Samarie, and unto the ferthest coostis of the erthe; and also ground therto is hadde open, M<SUP>t</SUP>. the last chapiter, in the eend, and M<SUP>r</SUP>., the last chapiter in the eend.

Also into this same purpos y argue thus. God made not the chirche of aungels in hevene without a disposicioun,<NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. disposioun, here and in following instances of the word.</NOTE> and a reule, and an ordre, hadde bitwixe hem, and not without this, that the netherer and lou&yogh;er aungels, in thilk disposicioun and ordre, schulden take her leernyng and infor|macioun of the othere aungels overer to hem in thilk disposicioun, as Seynt Denyce, the disciple<MILESTONE N="50a" UNIT="folio"> of Seynt Poul, and ful greet clerk, openli techith in his book of the <I>Hevenli Ierarchie</I>, and also in his book of the <I>Chirchis Ierarchie in erthe</I>, the last chapiter.

Also 
<PB REF="00000186.tif" N="186"> thus; sithen Poul seith, Hebr. vii<SUP>e</SUP> c., thus, <I>Whanne preesthode is translatid, it is nede that the lawe be translatid</I>, et cetera, no man may seie nay, but that Poul meened preesthode to be in the new law, bi the wil and purpos of God, and that the preesthode of the newe lawe succedith to the preesthode of the oolde lawe, as the newe lawe succedith to the oold lawe, and ellis these<MILESTONE N="50b" UNIT="folio"> translaciouns, of which Poul spekith, were not doon.

<P>Now if y schal sette to al this what y have in experience, I seie thus.

<P>If thou seie here for thee and thi felawschip thus: We musten nedis be excusid that we turnen

Also resoun therto moveth thus. The chirche, or the clergie, in delyveryng to peple feith which is in Holy Writt, alleggith for thilke delyveraunce Holi Writt, and expowneth Holi Writt into thilk feith so delyvered. Wherfore, the chirche in that biknowith that he hath thilk feith of Holi Writte, and so not of him silf principali; forwhi not of him silf originali or groundeli, but of the seid Holi Writt eer and bifore, and therfore of Holi Writt originali and groundeli. And so as anentis al feith conteynyd in Holi Scripture, the same Scripture schulde be<MILESTONE N="82b" UNIT="folio"> principal bifore the chirche. Confirmacioun to the same may be this. If the chirche hadde of him silf principali, groundli, and fundamentali, al the feith which is conteynyd in Holi Writt, the chirche wolde not, and ou&yogh;te not forto leene to Holi Writt, as for grounding and foundamental teching of thilk feith, neither wolde sende eny askers into Holi Writt, or wolde labore forto expowne Holi Writt to hem into thilk feith. But the chirche wolde and ou&yogh;te seie to suche askers of ri&yogh;t feith: <I>Bileve &yogh;e to me for that y seie this to be ri&yogh;t bileeve.</I> And the chirche wolde not fecche to suche askers autorite of a thing lou&yogh;er, and of 
<PB REF="00000236.tif" N="236"> lasse auctorite to the purpos, than the chirche is. Wherfore the chirche, as it seemeth, bi his owne pretencioun or interesse to expowne Holi Writt into teching which is trewe feith, must nedis knowleche that he takith Holi Scripture for his better, worthier, hi&yogh;er, and groundier foundament of the feith, which feith the chirche techith bi Holi Writt,<MILESTONE N="83a" UNIT="folio"> and bi the exposicioun of the same Holi Writt.

<P>Fadir, a&yogh;ens this, which &yogh;e han allowid bifore in the x<SUP>e</SUP> chapiter to be trewe, that Holi Writt is such a ground and foundement of oure Cristen general feith, that noon gretter, or bettir, or surer to us, ground or foundament is for our Cristen general feith writen in Holi Writt, y may argue bi viii principal argumentis, of which this is the first. No thing is to be seid ground to us of oure feith, without which thing oure feith my&yogh;te have be<MILESTONE N="84a" UNIT="folio"> sufficientli groundid and witnessid. But without Holi Scripture oure now had feith my&yogh;te have be to us sufficientli groundid, wherfore Holi Scripture is not to be seid grounde of oure feith. The first premysse is to be proved 
<PB REF="00000238.tif" N="238"> herbi. No thing is ground of another thing, without which the othere thing may be. And the ii premysse is to be proved thus. Thou&yogh; the apostlis hadde not write eny word, &yogh;itt thei my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t to othere clerkis and lay folke the al ful hool feith, sufficientli to the bihove of the peple, as to her therof the leernyng, re|porting, and remembring, whiche cleerkis and lay folk, so tau&yogh;t of the apostlis, and overlyvyng to the apostlis, my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t othere clerkis and lay folk the same al hool feith sufficientli; which, surviving and overlyvyng her techers, my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t othere folk, bothe of the clergie and of the layfe, the same hool feith sufficientli; whiche folke so tau&yogh;t, also surviving, and overlyvyng her techers, my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t the same al hool feith<MILESTONE N="84b" UNIT="folio"> sufficientli to othere, and so forth into this present dai, without eny writing maad and delyvered to folk upon the same feith so tau&yogh;t. And if this had be doon, thanne the feith of ech leerners<NOTE PLACE="foot">So in MS.</NOTE> hadde be sufficiently ynou&yogh; groundid in her techers, and in no scripture therupon maad. Wherfore it folowith that scripture is not, ne was not the ground of feith to eny persoonys bileevyng.</P>
<P>That this is trewe, which is bifore takun in the proof of the ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse, that thou&yogh; the apostlis hadde not writen eny word, thei my&yogh;ten 
<PB REF="00000239.tif" N="239"> have tau&yogh;t the al hool ful feith to peple sufficientli, y may argue thus. In tyme of the oold lawe, it was so that al the bileve conteynyd in thilk lawe was tau&yogh;t bi mouth, and was leerned bi mouth. Forwhi, Exodi. the xiii<SUP>e</SUP> chap., whanne it is seid of the paske day, that it schulde be kept &yogh;eerli, bi the lawe thanne rennyng, it is seid ferther anoon aftir, thus: <I>And thou schalt telle to thi sone in that day, and schalt</I><MILESTONE N="85a" UNIT="folio"> <I>seie:&mdash;this is it what the Lord did to me, whanne y &yogh;ede out of Egipt, and it schal be as a signe in thin honde, and as a memorial bifore thin i&yogh;en, and that the lawe of God be ever in thi mouth, for in a stronge hond the Lord ledde thee out of Egipt</I>, et cetera. Also soone aftir there, whanne it is bede that the peple of Iewis schulde halowe to God ech first gendrid thing, that openeth the wombe among the sones of Israel, as wel of men as of beestis, thanne it is seid anoon aftir thus: <I>And whanne thi sone schal aske of thee to morewe and seie, What is this? thou schalt answere to him, In a strong honde the Lord ledde us out of Egipt of the house of servage. For whanne Pharao was maad hard, and wolde not delyvere us, the Lord killid al the first gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the first gendrid of man til to the first gendrid of beestis. Therfore y offre to the Lord al thing of mawle kinde that openeth the wombe, and y a&yogh;enbie alle</I> 
<PB REF="00000240.tif" N="240"> <I>the first gendrid thingis of my sones.

Thou schalt teche tho to thi sones and thi sones sones. Telle thou the day in which thou stodist bifore thi Lord God in Oreb, whanne the Lord spake to me, and seid</I>, et cetera. Also, Deutron. xi<SUP>e</SUP> chap., it was seid thus: <I>Putte &yogh;e these wordis in &yogh;oure hertis and soulis, and hange &yogh;e tho wordis for a signe</I><NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. assigne.</NOTE> <I>in hondis, and sette &yogh;e bitwixe &yogh;oure i&yogh;en; teche &yogh;oure sones that thei thenke in tho wordis, whanne thou sittist in thin house, and goist in the wey, and liggist doun</I><MILESTONE N="86a" UNIT="folio"> <I>and risist. Thou schalt write tho wordis on the postis and &yogh;atis of thin house, that the daies of thee and of thi sones be multiplied in the lond which</I>, et cetera. Wherfore, bi like skile, in tyme of the newe lawe, the al hool feith my&yogh;te have be tau&yogh;t bi word of mouthe fro oon to an other, into this present day sufficientli. Ferthermore, into 
<PB REF="00000241.tif" N="241"> proof or into confirmacioun of the same seid ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse availith this, that we seen in summe monesteries the kunnyng, and the fulfilling of certeyn usagis and customes be lad forth in persoones of the monestarie, and be continued, bothe in knowing and in fulfilling sufficientli, fro the first fadris of the monestaries unto this present day, and that without eny writyng maad upon the same usagis, but bi discente of word oonli fro persoone into persoone. Wherfore, in lijk maner, the kunnyng and the using of al oure hool feith my&yogh;te have be hadde, and lad, and contynued sufficientli bi mynde and<MILESTONE N="86b" UNIT="folio"> bi teching of mouth, fro fadris and prelatis into her children and parischens, without eny writyng to be maad therupon.</P>
<P>The secunde argument is this. If it had be doon in dede, as is next above argued that it my&yogh;t so have be doon, that is to seie, if it had be so doon that the apostlis hadden tau&yogh;t bi word manye clerkis, and manye of the lay folk, the hool al ful feith sufficientli, and these clerkis and laifolk, surviving and overlyvyng to the apostlis, hadden tau&yogh;t bi word the same hool al feith to othere clerkis and lai folk, suc|ceding aftir the deeth of the apostlis, and that sufficientli, and so forth into this day, thanne the feith so tau&yogh;t bi word, and so descending 
<PB REF="00000242.tif" N="242"> bi word fro persoonys into persoonys into this present day sufficientli, had be sufficientli groundid in the clergie, whilis the clergie so tau&yogh;ten to othere; thou&yogh; therwith a scripture hadde be maad and delyvered forth bi the apoostlis upon the same feith, so bi word tau&yogh;t to othere. But so it was in dede, that the apostlis tau&yogh;ten othere clerkis the ful al hool feith bi word<MILESTONE N="87a" UNIT="folio"> sufficientli, and tho clerkis, so tau&yogh;t of the apostlis, sufficientli tau&yogh;ten othere clerkis, succeding aftir hem, the same al hool feith, and that bi word sufficientli, and so forth contynuali into this present day. Wherfore, the al hool ful feith, bothe in the tyme of the apostlis, and alwey ever sithen, was groundid sufficientli in the clergie, for the tyme beyng and lyvyng, and bi the maner now seid teching and delyveryng. And thanne ferther it folowith thus. If the clergie for the tyme being, bi her such now seid teching and delyveryng, was and is sufficient ground for our feith for al tyme, sithen the daies of the apostlis, it folowith at the leest that forto loke aftir, or sette eny other thing, as is Scripture, or eny other thing, to be ground of the same feith aftir Cristis teching bi word, and sithen the teching of the apostlis bi word, is no nede. The first premysse of this secunde principal argu|ment is open ynou&yogh; to be trewe; and the ii<SUP>e</SUP> 
<PB REF="00000243.tif" N="243"> premysse of the same argument schal be proved<MILESTONE N="87b" UNIT="folio"> thus. Crist bade to hise apostlis, Mathew, the last chapiter, thus: <I>Go &yogh;e therfore and teche &yogh;e alle folkis, baptising hem in the name of the Fadir, and of the Sone, and of the Holi Goost, teching hem to kepe alle thingis, what ever thingis y have co|maundid to &yogh;ou;</I> and also, Mark the last c<SUP>r</SUP>., Crist bede to hise apostlis thus: <I>Go &yogh;e into al the world and preche &yogh;e the gospel to every creature.</I> And anoon aftir, it is seid there thus: <I>Thei, forsothe, goyng forth prechiden every where</I>. But so it is that the apostlis hadden not fulfillid this now seid comaundement, maad to hem bi Crist, in lasse than thei hadden prechid, bi word of mouthe sufficientli, al the hool feith necessarie to be had of the peple; forwhi, al the hool feith necessarie to be had, is includid in the gospel of God, that is to seie, in the message of God, which message God sent into the world. Wherfore, sothe it is that the apostlis prechiden bi word of mouthe, to othere clerkis and folkis, al the hool<MILESTONE N="88a" UNIT="folio"> ful feith sufficientli; and so the secunde bifore maad principal premysse to be proved is trewe.</P>
<P>The iii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is this. If the apostlis hadden tau&yogh;t manye clerkis, and manye of the laifolk, the hool al ful feith bi word of mouthe principali, and these clerkis and layfolk, survyvyng and over-lyvyng to the apostlis, hadden tau&yogh;t, bi 
<PB REF="00000244.tif" N="244"> word principali, the same hool feith to othere clerkis, and to othere folk after the deeth of the apostlis, and so forth into this day, thanne the al hool feith so tau&yogh;t bi word of mouth principali, and so descending bi word principali, fro persoonys into persoonys, unto this present day, hadde be principali groundid in the clergie, whilis the clergie so tau&yogh;t othere, thou&yogh; therwith had be a scripture maad, and delyvered forth bi the apostlis to othere, upon the same feith. But so it was in dede, that the apostlis tau&yogh;ten othere clerkis the hool ful feith, bi word principali, and tho clerkis so tau&yogh;t of the apostlis bi word principali, tau&yogh;ten othere<MILESTONE N="88b" UNIT="folio"> clerkis succeding to hem the same al hool feith, and that bi word principali, and so forth contynueli into this present day. Wherfore, the al hool feith, bothe in the tyme of the apostlis, and alwey sithen, was groundid principali in the clergie for the tyme beyng and lyvyng, and bi maner now seid teching and delyveryng. And thanne ferther it folowith thus: if the clergie for the tyme beyng, bi her now seid such teching and delyvering, was and is the principal ground for oure feith, for al tyme aftir the daies of the apostlis, it folowith at the fulle that forto loke aftir, or seche aftir, or seie Scripture to be the principal ground of our feith, or that Scripture schulde be a principal ground therof, and more necessarie and better grounding 
<PB REF="00000245.tif" N="245"> of the same feith than is the clergie or the chirche, aftir the daies of the apostlis, is waast, ydil, vanite and untrewe. The first premysse of this iii principal argument is pleyn ynou&yogh; to be trewe.<MILESTONE N="89a" UNIT="folio"> And for proof of the ii<SUP>e</SUP> premisse of this iii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument, may be maad the same argument which bifore is maad for proof of the ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse, in the ii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument, and that bi the there rehercid textis, of Mathew the last chapiter, and of Mark the last chapiter.</P>
<P>The iiii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is this. The chirche of Crist, which he foundid in erthe, and of which he is the heed, is alwey and al tymes oon and the same, as Seynt Poul witnessith, ad Eph. v<SUP>e</SUP> c.,<NOTE PLACE="foot">The reference is from the margin.</NOTE> where he seith that oon<NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. oo.</NOTE> man to have bi the lawe oon wyf undepartabili, signifieth Crist to have oon chirche for his spouse. And the same witnessith the clergie, bi the profis or sequencis, whiche he singith in the masse of dedicacioun feest day, and in the viii<SUP>e</SUP> day of the same feest. And this same is comounli allegoriesed upon thilk text, Cant. vi<SUP>e</SUP> c.: <I>Oon is my culum</I>. But so it was, that in the tyme of the apostlis, the chirche of Crist in erthe, bi his principal party, which was the clergie, was of so greet worthines,<MILESTONE N="89b" UNIT="folio"> and auctorite, and dignite, that he thanne more 
<PB REF="00000246.tif" N="246"> groundid the feith of Crist, than scripture groundid feith of Crist thanne. Forwhi the apostlis, thanne being the clergie of Cristis chirche, groundiden more Cristis feith than her writyng, maad and writen bi hem, groundid as thanne the same feith; in as moche as the effect of a cause doith not so moche into another effect, as doith the cause of the same effect into the same other effecte, aftir good philsophie. Wherfore it seemeth folowe that the chirche of Crist, now being, and at al tyme a this side the apostlis for the tyme being, is and was of lijk greet worthines, auctorite, and dignite, that he now more groundith the feith of Crist than Scripture groundith now the same feith. Sithen oon and the same chirche is now and thanne, and therfore, bi like skile, the same clergie of the chirche is now, which was thanne.</P>
<P>The v<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is this. The clergie<MILESTONE N="90a" UNIT="folio"> of the chirche dispensith with the thing which Holi Scripture forbedith. Forwhi, the pope &yogh;eveth leeve to a bigam, that is to seie, to a man that hath be twies weddid, forto be a dekene and a preest, notwithstonding that Holi Scripture forbedith it, i<SUP>e</SUP> Thi<SUP>e</SUP>., 3<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>. But so it is that the lasse worthi refreyneth not the worthier, neither lowseth the bindingis of the worthier; wherfore the clergie of holi chirche is worthier, my&yogh;tier, and of gretter auctorite, than is Holi Scripture, or at the leest the 
<PB REF="00000247.tif" N="247"> clergie is of evene worthines, even power, and my&yogh;te, and of auctorite with Holi Scripture of the Newe Testament.</P>
<P>The vi<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is this. The chirche of Crist, bi his cheef party the clergie, now and al tymes, hath power to expowne, declare, and inter|prete Holi Scripture, hou Holi Scripture oweth to be undirstonde, in the sense and undirstonding of God. But so it is that even peer hath not power into his even<NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. eeve.</NOTE> peer, aftir the comoun wel<MILESTONE N="90b" UNIT="folio"> allowid proverbe, neither the lasse worthi hath power over his worthier, as may be takun of Poul, Hebr. vii<SUP>o</SUP> capitulo,<NOTE PLACE="foot">MS. a later addition.</NOTE> where he seith that the lasse worthi is blessid of the more worthi. Wherfore it seemeth that the clergie, and the chirche bi his parti which is the clergie, is more worthi than is Holi Scripture.</P>
<P>The vii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is this. What ever thing nedith to have upon him silf an inter|preter, or a declarer, nedith to have the same thing as his overer and worthier, but so it is that Holi Scripture nedith to have of him silf an interpreter and a declarer, which is the clergie in erthe, as forto schewe which is the dewe undirstonding of Holi Scripture; wherfore Holi Scripture nedith to have the clergie, as to be to Holi Scripture an overer, and to him as a worthier.
<PB REF="00000248.tif" N="248"></P>
<P>The viii<SUP>e</SUP> argument is this. What ever thing the apostlis settiden in the comune crede, is to be bileeved and to be holden and usid of alle Cristen, but the apostlis settiden in the comune crede this<MILESTONE N="91a" UNIT="folio"> article, that it is forto bileeve to the general holi chirche in erthe; wherfore nedis it is to bileeve to the universal, or general holi chirche in erthe. And we mowe in noon other wise bileeve to holi chirche in erthe, than we bileeven to the clergie of the general chirche in erthe, for as myche as the clergie is the principale parti of holi chirche in erthe. Wherfore it folowith that nedis we muste bileve to the clergie of the general chirche in erthe. And if the clergie ou&yogh;ten in eny dede be bileeved, he ou&yogh;te be bileeved in his dede, whanne he determyneth eny article to be taken as feith; for as myche as this dede is oon of the grettist aviseable dedis which the clergie dooth. Wherfore alle Cristen owen forto bileeve to the deter|mynacioun of the clergie, thou&yogh; he determyne a&yogh;ens Holi Scripture.</P>

<P>SONE, thi seid viii argumentis ben ri&yogh;t welcome to me, for me thenkith the answer and the assoiling of<MILESTONE N="92b" UNIT="folio"> hem with Goddis grace schal do good. The ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse of the same first principal argument, whanne it is seid thus: without Holi Scripture, oure now had feith my&yogh;te have be to us sufficientli groundid, is fals, forto speke of kindeli my&yogh;te in oure side, and in oure soulis, without greet singuler myracle of God, above kind, to have be doon in oure resouns, and mynde, and so it is moost convenient in this purpos to speke. And whanne, for proof of this ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse, it is argued thus: thou&yogh; the apostlis hadden not write eny word, &yogh;itt thei my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t to othere clerkis and layfolk the al hool ful feith sufficientli, sotheli this is fals. Forwhi, a feith is not tau&yogh;t to a peple sufficientli, but if it be tau&yogh;t so that bi thilk teching thei mowe cleerli undirstonde al it, and esili reporte al it, and remembre al it, and kunne al it, perfitli and currauntli, and kunne reherce it, and talke it in a stable foorme of wordis,<MILESTONE N="93a" UNIT="folio">

And sotheli, forto speke of al the hool ful feith writen in the gospels and epistlis, it may not in this seid wise be tau&yogh;t, without that it be write, and but if the writing therof be delyvered to the clergie. Wherfore, oure al hool feith which is now bitakun to us in Scripture, my&yogh;te never bi kinde have be tau&yogh;t sufficientli to eny peple, without therof the scripture; and thou&yogh; ful manye a processe withynne the boondis of the gospels ben lawe of resoun and of kinde, &yogh;itt this that Crist tau&yogh;t it, and rehercid it, is feith, and so the al hool feith writen in the gospels is over long a tale forto be sufficientli leerned, without therof the writyng. And therfore, sithen neither the apostlis, neither eny othere clerkis, my&yogh;ten have tau&yogh;t sufficientli the seid feith without scripture, and the peple my&yogh;te<MILESTONE N="93b" UNIT="folio"> not, bi studiyng in the scripture, have leerned without techers, it folowith nedis that Holi Scripture is more worthi ground of oure feith than is eny congregacioun of the clergie.

Wherfore, bi al resoun, in lijk maner it wolde have be, and was in dede, of the reporte of the dedis and wordis of Crist, eer thei were writen bi the evangelistis. And that in dede it was so, therynne witnessith Luk, in the prolog of his gospel, and seith that therfore he was movid forto write the gospel which he wrote, and so bi lijk skile for the same<MILESTONE N="95a" UNIT="folio"> cause the othere evangelistis gaven hem to writing. Hou ever therfore my&yogh;te it have be wel and trewe of oure feith, if it schulde have come to us bi reporte of heering, and bi mouth speking, without therof the writing. Also, what that ever eny

And therfore nedis the Holi Scripture is more worthi ground for oure feith, than is the clergie of the hool chirche in erthe. And if thou wolte wite of what scripture y meene, certis it is the writing of the Oold Testament, and of the Newe Testament, for it witnessith al the feith, or ellis, at the lest, wel ny&yogh; al the feith which Crist sechith of us. &yogh;he, and the writing of the Newe Testament confeermeth al the Oold Testament, in that that the writyng of the Newe Testament referrith us oft into the writing of the Oold Testament, as M<SUP>t</SUP>. 26 c.;<MILESTONE N="95b" UNIT="folio"> M<SUP>r</SUP>. xii c., and M<SUP>r</SUP>. 14<SUP>e</SUP> c., and 15<SUP>e</SUP> c.

<P>Ferthermore, sone, not oonli the writing of the al hool feith in the gospels is so necessarie to the peple, being a this side the apostlis; but also the same writing, maad and writen of the apostlis, were ri&yogh;t necessarie, as bi wey of kinde and of resoun to the same apostlis, that bi the writing of the apostlis, whiche thei wroten, thei hemsilf my&yogh;ten holde in mynde the multitude of tho trouthis there writen.

<P>For answer to the textis bifore alleggid of the<MILESTONE N="96a" UNIT="folio"> Oold Testament, in the first argument, it is to be seid that thou&yogh; bi tho textis it is had that fadris schulden teche by mouthe her sones, and her sones sones, the lawis of God, and the benefetis of God, &yogh;itt bi tho textis it is not hadde that thilk teching, to be doon bi mouthe, schulde have be sufficient teching to tho sones, and sones sones, without writing; and therfore tho textis maken not into the entent into which the first argument hem alleggith; namelich, sithen in the processis of the same textis it is hadde among that it was bede with al this, that the fadris schulden teche her sones bi mouthe; it is had in the last of tho textis, that is to seie, which is alleggid, Deutron. xi<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>., that tho same fadris, and alle the peple, schulde have Goddis lawis, and Goddis benefetis in writing.

<P>But thanne, fadir, if it was so necessarie writing to be hadde upon Cristen feith, whi was this writyng of our feith so long tyme deferrid, eer it was maad bi the apostlis, as that Mathew wrote his gospel in the vii<SUP>e</SUP> &yogh;ere aftir Cristis ascencioun, and Mark wrote in the x<SUP>e</SUP> &yogh;ere aftir Cristis ascencioun, as may be had bi croniclis of Martyn, and Luk wrote aftir other writers of the gospels, as he seith him silf in the prolog of his gospel, and Ion wrote aftir alle the othere, as manye men trowen? Also whi wrote not ech apostle as wel as summe? And also whi wroten not thei to ech countre?</P>
<P>Sone, answere to thi first questioun may be this. Our Lord is wisist, and he is, forto lede us into our kunnyng to be had in profitabilist maner, alwey rediest. And for as myche as peple, to<MILESTONE N="97a" UNIT="folio"> knowe bi experience hou necessarie it was to hem forto have her feith writen, was to hem more profitable, than forto it knowe without experience, therfore God so schope that the feith schulde bi a notable tyme be preched oonli bi word to the peple, that thei my&yogh;ten therbi take experience that preching of the al hole feith bi word oonli, were not sufficient without therof the writing; and thanne that therfore the peple schulde desire to have the feith writen; and the apostlis schulden 
<PB REF="00000256.tif" N="256"> se the same treuthe bi experience, and schulden consente forto write to the peple the same feith, which bifore bi parcellis thei prechiden bi word. An other cause my&yogh;te have be this: a preciose thing, whanne it is li&yogh;tli and soone &yogh;ovun, without long bifore goyng desire to have it, schal be the lasse sett bi, whanne it is receyved; and for as myche as the writyng, conteynyng oure al hool feith, is preciose and ou&yogh;te not be sette litil bi, neither be feyntli and unworthili receyved, therfore<MILESTONE N="97b" UNIT="folio"> God so schope that it was longe of the peple desirid, eer thei it receyveden, as for lijk skile God differreth ful holy mennys boonys, for that bi her longe desiring, and preiyng, and abiding aftir it, thei schulden the more ioie have, and the more thanke God whanne thei it receyveden. Another cause rennyng herwith my&yogh;te be, that the apostlis hadden not grettist leisers, for persecuciouns, that thei my&yogh;ten anoon in the bigynnyng have writen, and peraventure longe tyme in the biginnyng the apostlis prechiden not, neither mynystriden to the peple but a fewe articlis of feith, as were these:&mdash;of Cristis comyng, and of his Incarnacioun, and of the cause whi he came; and longe tyme unnethis my&yogh;te suffice forto bringe the peple into consente and bileeve of these fewe feithis. Also, scolers in ech kinde of scole schulden not be oppressid, in the bigynnyng of her scole,

And thus myche for answer to thi first questioun.</P>
<P>If it be trewe, that Ioon the evangelist wrote his gospel eer than it is seid that he wrote, and so that he wrote his gospel bifore his comyng from exile, as therto may be hadde greet motyve bi the writyngis of Seynt Denys Ariopagite, bi cause Ioon hadde writen his gospel eer Dynys wrote hise bokis, thanne answere to thi secunde questioun may be this. Ri&yogh;t as what is necessarie to a comounte is to be purveied fore, so what is waast, or comberose, and chargeose to a comounte is to be left of and to be avoidid; and for as moche as whanne Mathew, Mark, Luk, and Joon hadden write, the othere apostlis si&yogh;en these writingis, and si&yogh;en that these writingis were sufficient to expresse the comyng of Crist, the birthe of Crist, the lyvyng of Crist, the teching of Crist, and therfore the othere apostlis wolden not,<MILESTONE N="98b" UNIT="folio"> as for the same maters, combre the peplis wittis with eny more writingis therupon; and that what oon apostle or a disciple wrote alle the othere apostlis, and disciplis knewen, we mowe take

<P>FADIR, a&yogh;ens &yogh;ou metith this, that the feith which was in the biginnyng of the world, and was contynued forth into the daies of Moyses, was not writen. Forwhi, Moyses, which was aftir the biginnyng of the world bi xx hundrid &yogh;eeris, wrote the book of Genesis, and as it is seid comounli, he wrote it bi inspiracioun, and bi such prophecie as wherbi thingis passid ben knowen above power to knowe hem bi kinde,<MILESTONE N="100b" UNIT="folio"> and &yogh;itt thilk feith was a longe tale, and a longe storie, as is opene bi the book of Genesis, with rehercels ful hard to mynde, upon generaciouns of persoonys, and upon the names of persoonys; wherfore it semeth that as wel the storie of the gospels my&yogh;te have be sufficientli tau&yogh;t of the apostlis, and have be leerned of the other clergi and of the peple withoute writing.</P>
<P>Sone, if thou, or eny other man ellis, were sikir or hadde eny greet liklihood herto, and gretter than to the contrarie, that ther was no writing of the feith in the eldist tyme, fro the bigynnyng of

But certis, noon sikirnes, neither eny such liklihood is hadde, but ful strong liklihood to the contrarie is had. Forwhi, soone aftir the flood of Noe, ther was leernyng of the vii sciencis, and writing maad in ii pilers, oon of bras, and<MILESTONE N="101a" UNIT="folio"> another of erthe, and also in the same tyme ther was leernyng and writyng of wicchecraft, or of nycromancie, as the Maistir of Stories writith, in the chapiter of the toure of Babel. And if worldli men in that tyme were so bisi in worldli leernyng and writing, it is not to be trowid but lijk bisi were summe of manye goostli men, in leernyng and writing of gostli maters, perteyning to the feith, and the servyce of God, and to the eend wherto man was maad. Wherfore, it is more likli that in tho daies soone aftir the flood of Noe ther was writing of feith, perteynyng to God, and to mannys governyng and eending, than that ther was noon such in tho daies anoon aftir the flood of Noe. Also, longe bifore the flood of Noe, Ennok foonde lettris, and wrote bookis as the Maistir of Stories seith. And this Ennok was a passing holy man, as the Bible witnessith; and he lyved in the daies of Adam. Wherfore,<MILESTONE N="101b" UNIT="folio"> sithen it is so that, such as a man is, such is his leernyng, studying, and writing, it is more

<P>Sone, thou seiest sooth, and therfore, as for answere to the ii<SUP>e</SUP> and iii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argumentis togidere, the ii premysse in ever either of hem is to be denied.

But certis, open it is to ech mannys resoun, that thou&yogh; the chirche now lyvyng be, in this seid maner of reputacioun, the same chirche whiche the apostlis weren, &yogh;itt it nedith not to folowe that this chirche, now lyvyng, hath like moche kunnyng and power forto witnes oure feith, as hadde the chirche which the apostlis weren, neither it folowith that this chirche, now lyvyng, hath more kunnyng and power forto witnesse, than hath the writing of the Newe Testament forto so witnesse, thou&yogh; it were so that the chirche of the apostlis hadde kunnyng<MILESTONE N="109b" UNIT="folio"> and power forto so more wittnesse.

But whilis the putting and the holding therof hurtith not my present entent, y wole here lete the treting therof passe undir suffraunce.</P>
<P>For answer to thi v<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument, thou schal undirstonde that Scripture of the Newe Testament is not, thoru&yogh; ech parti of him, lijk in auctorite, in worthines, and in dignite. Forwhi, summe parties of Scripture techen to us feith, summe techen to us lawe of kinde, and of natural resoun, as the text in it silf wel schewith, and Austyn witnessith the same. Nevertheles this, that Crist tau&yogh;t thilk lawe of kinde and of resoun, wherof it is writen in Holi Writte that Crist hem tau&yogh;te, is feith. Forwhi, this, that he so tau&yogh;t hem, can not be leerned and founde bi mannys resoun, without therof a teller and a denouncer. Summe parties of the seid Scripture techen to us positive ordinauncis of Crist, as ben the sacramentis, and sum partie therof techen to us ordinauncis of sum apostle, as the lawe of bigamie, and that a womman<NOTE PLACE="foot">So in MS.</NOTE> vowe not chastite bifore the

Now, sone, thou&yogh; the clergie, that now is, and thou&yogh; the pope that now is, may dispense with it that Scripture techith us the ordinaunce of an apostle, and may revoke it, as he<MILESTONE N="111b" UNIT="folio"> may dispense with this, that Poul ordeynyd a bigam to not be deken or preest, i<SUP>e</SUP> Thi. iii<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>.; and with this, that Poul ordeynede a widowe to not take perpetual widewite, undir boond, eer she ben of lx<SUP>e</SUP> winter, and but if sche hadde be wijf of oon man, i<SUP>e</SUP> Thi. v<SUP>e</SUP> cap.; &yogh;he and revoke these ii pointis, bicause that the pope is of lijk auctorite and of iuresdiccioun with ech or with the grettist of the apostlis; &yogh;itt herof folewith not that the clergie now lyvyng, or the pope now lyvyng, may dispense with this that Scripture techith as the positive ordynaunce of Crist, or that he may revoke eny of tho ordynauncis. Forwhi, so revoke or dispense my&yogh;te noon of the apostlis. And so, thou&yogh; the chirche now lyvyng be evene in autorite and power with sum parti of Scripture, as with ful few parties of Scripture, as in this, forto make positive ordynauncis lijk as Holi Scripture bi power of the apostle maad, and forto revoke thilk positive ordynaunce of Holi Scripture,<MILESTONE N="112a" UNIT="folio"> maad bi the apostle, &yogh;itt he is not evene in auctorite and power with al the Scripture of the Newe Testament, neither with manye othere parties therof.
<PB REF="00000279.tif" N="279"></P>
<P>To thi vi<SUP>e</SUP> argument y answere, graunting the first premysse, that the chirche now lyvyng hath power forto expowne, and interprete, and declare, the trewe undirstonding of Holi Scripture. And y denye the ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse, that even peer hath no power into his even peer. Forwhi, the sugget hath sum power upon his sovereyn, as for to loke upon him, forto speke to him, and forto warne him of hise harmes, and forto defende him, and suche othere. And so the chirche now being, &yogh;he, and ech thrifty wel sped studient in divinite, hath power forto declare and expowne Holi Scripture, &yogh;he, and ech good gramarien hath power to construe Scripture, so that as the verri dewe, litteral undirstonding we schulden aske and leerne of a greet leerned sad divine, rather than of another &yogh;onger and lasse leernyd divine; so we<MILESTONE N="112b" UNIT="folio"> schulde aske and leerne it of the universal or general hool clergie, rather than of eny particuler persoone or persoonys, save in the excepcioun spokun oft, in the first parti of this book, in the vii<SUP>e</SUP> c<SUP>r</SUP>., and in othere chapiters aftir there folowing. And therfore, as it folowith not herof that ech thrifti divine, and ech gramarien, is more worthi forto grounde feith than is Holi Scripture, so it folewith not that the chirche now lyvyng, or the clergie now lyvyng, is more worthi forto grounde feith than is Holi Scripture. Sone, manye kindis 
<PB REF="00000280.tif" N="280"> of powers ther ben, the even peer hath no power of constreynyng upon his even peer, that is to seie forto make his even peer to do what he wole not do in thilke kinde of werk, in which thei ben evene peers; and &yogh;itt oon evene peer may revoke and relese that, that the othere evene peere ordeyneth, or biddith to be do, or doith in dede; as we seen that oon executour revokith and relesith what the othere ioined to him executour ordeyneth, biddith, or doith, namelich bi the lawe<MILESTONE N="113a" UNIT="folio"> of Ynglond; and in this case is ech pope with ech of the apostlis.</P>
<P>As for answer to the vii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument, y seie that power forto interprete, expowne, and declare which is the ri&yogh;t sense of Scripture, is not but a ful litil power upon Scripture, as power forto construe Scripture aftir rewlis of gramer is a ful litil power upon Scripture, but &yogh;itt moche lasse than the othere power now spokun. Forwhi, so bi these powers no thing is takun awey fro Scripture, what he had bifore, neither eny thing is sette of the newe to Scripture, what Scrip|ture hadde not bifore, neither eny thing is comaundid to be, or to not be, a&yogh;ens the co|maunding, or the nylling of scripture. And that, bicause this seid power of interpreting, expown|yng, declaring, and construyng, is not but a power of kunnyng oonli, forto schewe and make open 
<PB REF="00000281.tif" N="281"> the thing of Scripture, which is in Scripture al redi bifore, thou&yogh; priveli and hid; ri&yogh;t as the preest<MILESTONE N="113b" UNIT="folio"> in lent tyme drawith the lent veile, and therbi makith open to the peple what was bifore in the auter al redi, thou&yogh; not seen of the peple. Wherfore the first premysse in thi vii<SUP>e</SUP> principal argument is untrewe, and to be denyed, whanne it is seid thus; what ever thing nedith to have upon him an interpreter, an expowner, or a declarer, nedith to have the same thing as his overer and worthier. And whi this is untrewe, it is now seid; forwhi, ellis a dekene, &yogh;he the parisch clerk, were worthier than the preest stonding at the auter, whanne the clerk drawith aside the lent veile. And also if the seid first premysse were trewe, thanne Scripture were worthier than sche her silf is, and sche were overer to her silf, which is repugnaunce. Forwhi, Scripture ful oft expowneth hir silf, bi as moche as bi the reding of Scripture in oon parti, a man schal leerne which is the trewe undirstonding of Scripture in an other parti, wherynne he doutid or unknewe bifore. Also, sone, the iugis which<MILESTONE N="114a" UNIT="folio"> the king makith in his rewme, forto iuge alle cause after the lawe which he and his parlament maken, ben not so worthi forto grounde ri&yogh;t|wisnes in causis, as the seid lawe is.

Forwhi, ful oft it is seen that oon persoone in a general counceil redressith al the counseil fro that that thei wolden ordeyne; as y have rad, if oon symple persoone had not a&yogh;enstonde bi his resounis, a general counceil wolde have ordeynyd that preestis schulde have be weddid to wijves if thei wolden; and also y have rad, in the <I>Thre departid Storie</I>, that

<P>But &yogh;itt, that the apostlis bitoken not, out and bisidis Holi Scripture, eny articlis unwriten to be bileeved for necessarie feithis, thou&yogh; summe men so comounli holden, y may argue bi ri&yogh;t notable evydencis, of whiche the firste is this. The apostlis bitoken not to Cristen men eny articlis to be bileeved as such seid feith, bi eny such wey whiche the apostlis knewen to be no spedeful and sufficient wey, forto in it bitake eny articlis to be bileeved as so greet feith; but so it is that the apostlis knewen wel, that to bitake to the heering and mynde of the peple oonli, without<MILESTONE N="123a" UNIT="folio"> writing, eny such articlis forto be of hem bileeved, was no spedeful and sufficient wey; wherfore the apostlis not so bitoken. The ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse of this argument may in this wise be proved. Thilke wey was wel knowun, considerid, and aspied to be insufficient and unspedful, which was bi the apostlis remedied, and left, and leid aside; but so 
<PB REF="00000296.tif" N="296"> it was, that this seid wey forto delyvere eny articlis as such feith to the peple, bi heering and mynde oonli, without writing, was left, and leid aside, and remedied bi this, that thei wroten the gospells and epistlis to the peple. Forwhi, ellis thei hadden no sufficient cause for to so write, and Luk in his prolog into hise gospel meneth the same; wherfore it folowith that the seid wey was weel knowun, and considerid, and aspied, to be insufficient for the seid entent to be sufficientli sped. Also the seid ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse may be proved thus. The apostlis,<MILESTONE N="123b" UNIT="folio"> made so wise bi the Holi Goost forto overse and knowe scripturis of the Oold Testament, my&yogh;te soone knowe and remembre hou that manye trouthis Adam seide and tau&yogh;te to hise sones and his ofspring, over it that is writen in the Bible, wherof no man in the tyme of apostlis couthe eny thing seie, and in lijk maner it was knowun of the apostlis to be trewe that Noe and Abraham seiden and tau&yogh;ten manye trouthis to her herers, not writen, whiche no man couthe reherce in tyme of the apostlis, and al for that thei were not writen. And in lijk maner it was trewe of David, and of Salomon, anentis her heerers, so that noon of her wordis ben knowun than<NOTE PLACE="foot">On margin, 'thanne.'</NOTE> tho that ben writen. And if we wolen come neer hoom, Joon the evangelist seith, in the last c<SUP>r</SUP>. of his gospel,<MILESTONE N="124a" UNIT="folio"> 
<PB REF="00000297.tif" N="297"> that mo myraclis Crist dide than ben writen in this book, which, if thei weren writen, al the world, thou&yogh; it were turned into bokis, schulde not take and comprehende; and &yogh;itt of alle tho myraclis not writen in the gospels, not oon is of us now knowun. Wherfore it folowith that so wys men as weren the apostlis in goostli necessarie maters, and so fulfillid with the Holi Goost, and also wel putte into good avisis bi ful witti clerkis convertid into Cristen feith, knewen wel that this weie forto delyvere necessarie feith to peplis, bi word, and heering, and mynde oonly, without therof the writing, was insufficient to the peple. The ii<SUP>e</SUP> evydence is this. If the apostlis hadden lete renne eny articlis undir necessarie feith to be bileeved, without therof the scripture, this entent and dede of the apostlis schulde have be better knowen and holden of the chirche, which was in tyme of greet Constantyne the emperour, than of<MILESTONE N="124b" UNIT="folio"> eny chirche being aftir tho seid daies. But so it was that the chirche in the daies of Constantyne helde not, trowid not, and considerid not, that the apostlis so left without writing eny articlis to be takun as necessarie feith, wherfore no chirche aftir the daies of Constantyne owith so holde. The ii<SUP>e</SUP> premysse y may prove thus. In the daies of the greet and first Constantyne, emperour, ther was maad an universal counceil of al Cristen in 
<PB REF="00000298.tif" N="298"> Nice of Bityne, in which universal counceil weren gaderid the Latyn clerkis, and the Greek cleerkis togider, for this entent principali, to declare the trewe feith in the article upon which Arri erride, and folowingli forto putte out, in an expresse crede, the substancial pointis and articlis of our feith, as is open in the stories clepid <I>Ecclesiastik Storie</I>, and <I>Tripartid Stori</I>, or ellis thus, <I>the chirchis stori</I>, and <I>the iii departid storie</I>, whiche stories ben the worthiest and moost credible of eny other, save<MILESTONE N="125a" UNIT="folio"> the Bible. And therfore, so thei dide, and made a crede which in the seid ii bokis is writen, but so it muste nedis have be that, if the chirche in tho daies hadde knowun, or trowid that the apostlis hadde delyvered to the peple eny articlis, undir heering and mynde oonli, the chirche in thilk seid general counseil, gaderid forto point and articlee<NOTE PLACE="foot">So in MS.</NOTE> maters of our feith, wolden rather have sette forth, in writing of the crede thanne maad, tho seid articlis which the apostlis left out of writing, than tho of whom expresse mensioun is maad in the writing of the apostlis. And that for as myche as to the more nede, remedie is rather to be &yogh;ovun, than to the lasse nede. And the nede to putte tho articlis undir writing was ful greet, as schal soone aftir appere. Wherfore, the chirche than gaderid hadde no conceite that the

And, in liik maner, as it was in the first seid general counseil<MILESTONE N="125b" UNIT="folio"> of Nice that thei pointiden out of articlis of bileeve to alle Cristen peple into a foorme of a crede, so dide another greet general counceil aftir, at Constantynopil, and manye othere provincial counceilis, as apperith in the book clepid Decrees of counceils, rehercen the ii now seid credis, and in noon of hem, so making and pointing articlis of oure feith in her credis, is mensioun maad of eny article tau&yogh;t bi the apostlis out of Scripture. The iii<SUP>e</SUP> evydence is this. If eny articlis schulde be lefte to peple fro the apostlis, undir heering and mynde, to be holde and bileeved of the peple greet as feith, these pointis and articlis schulde be tho rather than othere, or as soone as othere:&mdash; that is to seie, we schulen preie toward the eest; we schulen blesse us with a cros; preestis schulen make thre foold crossis upon the breed and wijne offride in the auter, bifore the consecracioun; the font of baptym schal be blessid with oile, and baptisid persoonys schulen be anointid with oil.<MILESTONE N="126a" UNIT="folio"> But so it is that ech of these seid governauncis takun her bigynnyng and ordynaunce of our fadris oonli, not the apostlis, bi a chapiter of holi Basile, in the Summe of Gracian, d. xi<SUP>e</SUP> c.

Also holi Basile, in the now bifore alleggid c<SUP>r</SUP>. in the Summe of Gracian, d. xi<SUP>e</SUP> c.

Wherfore, holi Basil conceyvyd no mo membris than these iii to be nedisli takun and kept of Cristen peple. And thanne folowith that he conceyvyd not suche a fourthe membre to be takun and kept of the peple, that is to seie, whiche the apostlis tau&yogh;ten, and leften, and bitoken for substancial feith, without writing. And that, bi the first now rehercid membre, Basil undirstode popis ordy|nauncis,

Forwhi, the ordinauncis of popis ben ful famose, and more famose, and of more reverence, and more attendaunce in the comoun peple, than is the custom and usage of the comoun peple, or, at the leest, of and even so myche; wherfore it is likli that Basil left not popis ordynauncis unspokun of, in his particioun bifore seid, but open it is that he speke not of<MILESTONE N="127a" UNIT="folio"> popis ordynauncis, but if he spake therof in the first membre of the seid particioun, wherfore it is trewe that he so spak.</P>

<P>And so, bi al that is writen fro the bigynnyng of this present chapiter hidirto, it semeth that the clergie ou&yogh;te not induce, or constreyne the othere peplein to bileeve and feith of other pointis and articlis, as upon the feith of whom is hanging oure salvacioun, than ben expressid in the litteral sense of Holi Scripture, or folowing of hem so expressid.</P>
